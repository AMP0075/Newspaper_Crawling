2016-11-09 06:32:00,Currency demonetisation: RBI got 6 months to prepare for this,"NEW DELHI: Around six months ago, the government asked the RBI to prepare for its latest assault on black money, and told the currency manager to print more Rs 50 and Rs 100 notes, with PM Modi having decided to phase out the current lot of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes earlier this year.    After all the task was humongous: replacing 23 billion notes. Besides, the information had to be kept confidential at all costs.    In any case, apart from the PM, only finance minister Arun Jaitley knew, and two senior officers each in the finance ministry and the RBI were in the loop.    The six months were used not just to print enough Rs 50 and Rs 100 currency notes, but also to plan the operations meticulously. This meant that, on Tuesday , the Reserve Bank of India initiated the first ""public"" move when its board met around 6 pm and recommended the withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Soon, the government, which was ready with the notification, moved the Cabinet, which met at 6.30 pm on Tuesday. The decision was taken and the PM went on air to announce the first demonetisation in 38 years.    The government's calculation was simple. It sees major gains accruing to the economy , beginning with an immediate halt to black money transactions -at least in the near run. This is expected to force people to use only legal channels, which will result in higher tax es in the government's kitty .    While those showing ""agricultural income"" can still use a possible loop transact in cash, the hole to transact in cash, the window is seen to be limited and the government expects bulk of the funds to flow into the banking system. This itself is going to provide more boost for lending, which has remained subdued, a senior government official said. ""We have hastened the printing of these notes,"" RBI governor Urjit Patel said.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Currency-demonetisation-RBI-got-6-months-to-prepare-for-this/articleshow/55323411.cms,

2016-11-09 11:14:00,Demonetisation leads to chaos on Delhi-Gurgaon expressway,"GURUGRAM: The ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes literally stopped the speed of the Millennium City. On Wednesday morning, heavy jams were seen on both sides of the Kherki Daula toll Plaza on Delhi-Gurgaon expressway.Two vital issues led to the snarls that lasted for around two hours near the toll booth. Firstly, due to shortage of small currency, more commuters preferred app based cabs instead of taking shared public transport. This increased the number of vehicles on the roads leading to congestion on the roads. Then the situation only got worse as the commuters insisted on paying the toll fee only through the now banned currency i.e. Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. While, the booth operators insisted that their change has already been exhausted. However, the local and traffic police intervened and situation was restored at around 10am.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/Demonetisation-leads-to-chaos-on-Delhi-Gurgaon-expressway/articleshow/55327236.cms,gurgaon
2016-11-10 12:28:00,Currency demonetization puts odds against casinos,"PANAJI: Fortunes of the five offshore casino operators in Goa seemed to hang as uncertain as the ball spinning on the roulette table after news broke out of the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 notes on Tuesday night.    Casino operators were left baffled and wondering how business will continue. ""So you want to catch a thief, and to do so, you light your house on fire. The thief may be caught, but your house has been burned,"" an offshore casino operator told TOI.    Reacting to the PM's announcement on Tuesday night, chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar had said ""Casinos are likely to get affected. All those with black money will be affected. Those with clean money need not worry.""    Even though no official comments were made by casino managements, several sources indicated a significant dip in operations. While some casino operators have stopped accepting notes of 500 and 1,000 denominations, others continue to accept the scrapped currency notes up to a specified limit.    ""Our company seniors have directed us to accept 500 and 1,000 notes for now, but with an upper limit of 5,000. No one can buy chips worth more than that and this is applicable to payments also made by credit cards,"" said a casino employee, adding that winning proceeds are also paid to punters in the denominations of 500 and 1,000.    An operating head of an offshore casino said that business has been affected badly, and they have been running short of currency notes to reward winners. ""Most are unwilling to accept 500 and 1,000 notes,"" he said.    Casinos, which earn one-third of Goa's total entertainment tax, have also imposed a restriction on gamblers taking away the winning chips in order to stop them from being used to convert black money. It is also feared that state coffers may be hit by the dip in casino business in the next few months. Commissioner, commercial taxes, Dipak Bandekar said ""We are receiving information of casino operations being hit"". Cars were seen lining up on Wednesday night along the Mandovi river promenade where customers are ferried to the offshore vessels. For the record, offshore casino vessels also offer entertainment and dining facilities which attracts tourists as well as locals.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Currency-demonetization-puts-odds-against-casinos/articleshow/55341027.cms,goa
2017-01-24 12:52:00,Kannada film shoots stalled because of demonetization,"The currency demonetization came as a surprise to people on Tuesday, with many not prepared for the immediate outcome. The Kannada industry has taken a beating, given how this short notice makes it inconvenient for many filmmakers to proceed/plan their shoot schedules. Many filmmakers were stumped with the decision, but hailed PM Narendra Modi's step to curb corruption and black money.    An industry insider says, 'It is not easy to suddenly begin working with cheques, given that the industry has always dealt with cash transactions across the board.'    Shooting of several under-production films has apparently been temporarily halted as production teams are unable to source smaller denomination notes to make payments to crew members, as well as for other day-to-day incidental expenses, including food and beverages, rentals on props like vehicles, etc.    While there is no official confirmation on this, a source at the Karnataka Film Workers and Technicians Union (KFWTU) admitted that several producers called to request that work progress as usual, with the promise of arranging funds to be disbursed as payments in the next couple of days. 'Production teams have asked for 2-3 days time to organize alternate payment options. We have given them the option to make cheque payments, which should solve the problem, but if they are dealing with black money, that is an issue,' says Chennaveerappa of the KFWTU.    Industry insiders are also saying that this could affect new films that are in the pipeline. 'There will be a lot of re-evaluation of investments from producers, as they borrow money from financiers who have liquid cash at their disposal always. Some producers will have to seek newer avenues,' says the source.    Another interesting trend could be greater investment from corporate entities in Sandalwood. 'The industry has earlier seen some big corporate names from Bollywood enter, but to no avail. This might break the monopoly of certain people and allow private and corporate bodies in Sandalwood,' adds another industry watcher.    John Jani Janardhan release pushed    The release of the Kannada film John Jani Janardhan, which was to hit movie halls on November 11, has been pushed. 'Audiences have no money for their livelihood, how will they come and watch a film? The percentage of those who would buy tickets online is minimal and we cannot risk releasing the film at a time like this. It will take some time for things to revert to normalcy. We will release the film on December 9,' says producer Padmanabha Gowda.",entertainment,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/Kannada-film-shoots-stalled/articleshow/55332090.cms,
2016-11-10 01:47:00,"Demonetisation puts tourists in trouble, spoils plans","CHENNAI: Travellers and tourists had a tough time at airports and railway stations while many travel agents suspended booking of tours and flight tickets on Wednesday, a day after the Union government declared Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes invalid. Though railway stations were accepting the currency, a few counters ran out of change and the absence of ATMs aggravated the issue.    Sources said foreigners who landed at Chennai and Trichy had difficulty changing dollars into the required amount of Indian rupee while those who were returning could not return the currency and buy dollars. Tourists at small towns had to face difficulty because many of the shops do not have card reading machines.    The situation at Chennai airport was better because cards are accepted for food and beverages at the terminals and airlines accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for booking tickets. However, Indigo did not allow use of the denomination for in-flight purchase and to pay excess baggage fee at the airport.    N Sadhakathulla who landed at Trichy said, ""During my travel from Kuala Lumpur, I came to know about the announcement. But I thought that we can get the required Rs 100 currencies from 'Currency Note Exchange Desk' at Trichy airport. However, we could not get the required volume.""    Those who had visa appointments had a difficult time because VFS did not accept the denomination which were declared invalid.    Travel Agents Federation of India office-bearer Basheer Ahmed said, ""Ticketing had to be temporarily stopped because of payment problem to IATA. We are also in talks with VFS to accept the currency. Today people who went to pay visa fees had a problem.""    Domestic and foreign tourists faced a tough time buying food and making purchases at restaurants and shops at small tourist towns like Ooty where many establishments do not have card reader machines and refused to accept the currency notes. In most of the tourist spots shops that sell souvenirs and local delicacies accept only cash. A few tourists missed on buying Nilgiri tea and home-made chocolates because the shops that sell these items accept cash only.    L Rakesh and Sharmila, who reached in Ooty on Tuesday morning from Hyderabad for a four-day holiday, suffered because they were strangers and shops were not accepting the money they had. Hiring an autorickshaw for visiting tourist spots became very difficult and at the end they were left with only option of walking the possible distances they could.    ""We have Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes only. Breakfast is free at the hotel so we are able to manage. But for other expenses during the day we are finding it very difficult"", he said.    Those who travelled by Omni buses did not face much problem because tickets were booked online. An Omni bus operator said, ""There was only 40% to 30% occupancy on buses of which 70% of the tickets were booked online. We accepted the currency because we did not want to turn away customers.""    The invalid notes were accepted at railway stations. But there was chaos at ticket counters at Central and Egmore because staff ran out of Rs100 notes. A railway official said, ""We gathered more liquid cash of Rs100 denomination soon after the announcement came. But that was also not adequate.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Demonetisation-puts-tourists-in-trouble-spoils-plans/articleshow/55340898.cms,chennai

Those not having notes of Rs100 or lesser denomination faced problems in buying things including medicines. Petrol stations are authorized to take demonetized notes but most of them soon ran out of notes of smaller denomination and had to close down.    Various people reacted differently to the government's move. Even those viewed it favourably wished that it should have been done gradually so as to avoid inconvenience to common people.    Savita Ther, a domestic servant from Yavatmal, said, that she could not buy medicines as she did not had notes of smaller denomination. ""I had four Rs500 notes, which was given to me by my employer. I did not have notes of smaller denominations. The pharmacy shop owner simply refused to accept a Rs500 note,"" she added.    Anandrao Bhongle, a lawyer from Wani, welcomed the initiative by Modi govt to contain the black money and counterfeit notes but said that there should have been a liberal policy to enable the poor people to ensure that they could buy items of daily use.    Shopkeepers, professionals and their customers faced many problems. Dipak Bhutada, a Wardha grocery shop owner said that customers offered him only demonetized currency on Wednesday. ""As I did not have that much change my business went down by 50%,"" he told TOI.    Prakash Kahare of Chandrapur had a similar experience. ""I had little cash of small denomination notes in the morning to run my business throughout the day. Hence I entertained only those coming with notes of small denomination or those wanting to spend entire Rs500 or Rs1000 note or at least more than 80% of it at my shop.""    Dr Sachin Pavade of Wardha, said that people only offered high denomination notes. ""We refused them but as health care is an emergency service, we offered it on the promise of patients paying up later,"" he added.    Petrol station owners across the region were not so generous. In many cases they shut shop as they had run out of notes of smaller denomination. Most of the owners slammed the government for not giving them some time to arrange for small denomination notes.    Demonetization seems to have hit the MLC elections in Gondia and Bhandara districts. Rumours are rife that the public representatives, who will vote in this election, are reportedly asking for gold ornaments from the candidates and are refusing to take cash.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Vid-towns-witness-chaos-following-demonetization/articleshow/55340941.cms,nagpur

The decision also had an impact on eateries, local transport auto-rickshaw, retail owners and jewellers.    At many shops, the owners had displayed boards, stating that do not accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. The demonetisation also led to a surge in gold prices from Rs 3,100 per gram to Rs. 3,400.    The jewellery shops were flooded on Tuesday night with customers buying gold. As the news spread, the Gujari area where jewellery shops are located was flooded with cash-rich people to buy gold. However, the same area was completely deserted on Wednesday and shop owners had put boards that Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes will not be accepted.    ""On Tuesday people thronged our shops with available cash and purchased jewelleries. We cannot declare the amount of transaction, but have maintained proper account and will exchange the notes as per the rules,"" said owner of a jewellery shop based in Gujari.    According to sources, at some places the rates of gold jewellery were as high as Rs 45,000 per 10 gram and people were still buying it to convert their money into asset.    ""We were happy that the official rate of gold shot up, but rarely any customer visited our shop as he was not having enough legal currency. We denied accepting notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000,"" said another jeweller.    Impact on retail business: The retail business in the city was also affected as shop owners insisted on currency notes other than Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. People having debit and credit cards opted for electronic transactions and the business was as usual at the shops having this facility.    ""I woke up early in the morning and as usual visited grocery shop to buy eggs and bread. I handed over Rs 500 note which was denied by the grocery shop owner. I searched around four shops but no one was ready to accept the money. Finally, I had to buy grocery on credit,"" said Vishal Shinde, a resident of Rajarampuri.    Impact on transport services: Commuters travelling and entering city experienced difficulty on Tuesday as they were not having change and could not get any as the ATMs were out of order. The autorickshaw drivers at Central Bus Stand did not allow passengers having notes legal currency notes. Traffic cops also experienced difficulty as they did not have exchange after they charged errant drivers with a fine of Rs 100 or Rs 200.    Satishchandra Kamble, president of private luxury bus association, said, ""All members of our organization convened a meeting on Wednesday and decided to accept the notes of Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 from tourists that will book tickets with us.

Incidentally, gold prices have shot up to around Rs 1,800 per 10 grams overnight increasing from around Rs 28,700 on Tuesday to Rs 30,500 on Wednesday. However, traders said there was not much surge in gold transactions following the demonetisation drive.According to realty sources, apartment prices may remain stagnant for the next few months, while prices of land, especially plots and bulk land, are expected to take a hit. ""In the long run, prices of layouts, plots and bulk land will witness a drop as majority of the black money is parked in the form of land. So, now with the demonetisation drive, it will be difficult for these people who have illegally amassed such assets to sell their land,"" said a prominent builder in the city on conditions of anonymity.Another builder said, ""There are two types of investments in real estate -- one in the form of built-up space such as apartments and the other in the form of plots. Most of the apartment transactions are in white as the buyers are people who avail housing loans and purchase properties from builders. The second form is purchase of plots. If the government is able to plug the loopholes successfully, then purchase of new land by the people with black money will become difficult. In the long run, it is good for prospective buyers and also builders.""Furthermore, he said, ""The main raw material for apartments is land and plots are now making up for almost 50-60% of the cost of built-up space. If land prices fall, then apartments will become more affordable for people.""However, he said, ""Once the price of property reaches a certain level, then it will remain stagnant for a while. Further escalation which is usually seen year-on-year will not be there.""Referring to the situation in and around Vizag, a layout developer on conditions of anonymity said, ""Some of the people had purchased bulk land in areas such as Bhogapuram and Sabbavaram expecting to reap windfalls due to various airport and educational projects respectively. These people had doubled the prices citing demand during the last one-and-half years. They will definitely take a hit.""Meanwhile, the Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry welcomed the demonetisation move and said, ""There is an estimated Rs 16 lakh crore in circulation and a bulk of that is in the form of unaccounted funds. In the short term, gold price may go up as a safe haven for investment. Real estate transactions will be severely impacted due to its nature and will see a downward trend in short to middle term. However its a welcome move in the long term. This move will help flush out unaccounted, counterfeit money as well as money used to fund terrorism. Though the government will expand its income tax payer base drastically, it will need to gear up to meet the requirements of the citizens with respect to electronic payments, small business transaction costs, government departments will need the wherewithal to deal with the flood of new assesees.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/CASH-CONUNDRUM-CONTINUESRealty-prices-may-drop-following-demonetisation/articleshow/55339250.cms,visakhapatnam

In many institutions, especially in private medical colleges, there are cash vending machines for counting of huge number of notes, as they charge about Rs1 crore-Rs 3 crore for a single MBBS or MD seat. According to parents, even colleges running courses like BA, BCom and BSc on no-grant basis, tell them to pay half amount of fees in cash. They also extort money from the students under one or other pretext like the capitation fees, building funds and others.""Because of demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1000 notes, the only mode of payment in cash will be Rs100 notes. Paying fees will now result in accumulation of such a huge amount of currency that it will automatically hog limelight,"" feels economist Vinayak Deshpande, who is also heading Nagpur University's Business Management department.Expectedly, the college managements are not ready to come out in open about their views. However, they told TOI that their finances would be surely affected and they wouldn't have any other option than to hike the fees. The academic heads in these colleges however displayed brave face by stating that there wouldn't be any affect, as they accept the fees in cheques or demand drafts. Vice chancellor of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (DMIMS), Dilip Gode, felt that after introduction of entrance exams like NEET, there was complete transparency in their fee structure. ""Students are admitted on the basis of merit, therefore, there is no question of donations whatsoever,"" he said.Some authorities feel that it might get tedious for students to pay the fees as they probably won't have access to the new denominations. Principal of Ambedkar College, PC Pawar said there won't be any effect on admissions. ""Demand for change will increase but overall, it's a smart move by the government which would benefit the students community ultimately in long run,"" he said.Some parents hailed the move stating that now the college wouldn't dare to ask them for donations in cash. ""Even if they demanded, we could tell them that it won't be possible for them to carry big cash. We could even lodge a complaint against them,"" they said.

Some people, who tried to disburse these notes at grocery stores, were disappointed as owners refuse to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 for small purchases. There was confusion at some medical shops where these notes were not accepted. However as announced by the government, some medical outlets accepted these notes. Ravindra of Ravindra Medicals in Keshwapur said: ""Since the morning, most of the people came with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes even for a purchase of Rs 40-50.

2016-11-10 07:18:00,Demonetisation move to curb Kerala's underground economy,"KOCHI: Demonetization of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes will have a cleansing effect on the state economy, which had been affected by the flow of hawala money and fake Indian currencies from the Middle East. A thriving underground economy and relatively-high real estate prices in Kerala, compared to its neighbours, are the results of these two factors.    Top enforcement directorate (ED) officials said that the Centre's abrupt decision has left hawala networks burdened with hordes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes which they can't now offload, leaving them in a tight spot.    ""The expected liquidity crunch and tight regulations in fund transactions in the coming days would definitely make such operations difficult in the short term,"" said a top official in ED's Kochi office, adding that the black economy for hawala transactions in Kerala could be in the range of Rs 700 crore a week. The figure was calculated on the basis of past seizures.    ""It remains to be seen how hawala networks will overcome the situation and how far they have managed to convert their cash holdings,"" a DRI official said.    Geojit BNP Paribas MD CJ George said that mopping up of black money will have positive results. ""Real estate and gold were two areas people were parking black money . With the demon etisation, apartments will be less expensive and the rent will come down.It can prompt a really healthy activity in real estate sector, eventually ,"" he said, adding that black money was pushing up realty prices.    Kerala hawala links with Pakistan is no secret. National Investigation Agency's (NIA) investigations had revealed that high quality fake notes, printed in Pakistan, were smuggled to Kerala through the Middle East. And they had terrorist connections too - when NIA dug up the case of a Malayali caught in 2008 at Karipur airport with fake notes (nearly Rs 72 lakh), it unearthed Tahir Taklya, one of the accused in 1993 serial Mumbai blast case. He had got the fakes from a Pakistani named Imitiaz Ibrahim.    In another smuggling case, registered in 2013 at Nedumbassery , NIA had found that Malayali smugglers had been getting fake notes from Dawood Ibrahim's syndicate in Pakistan by paying genuine currency in exchange since 2007. NIA has filed chargesheets in nine cases related to smuggling of fake Indian currency to Kerala. In fact, five of its six cases, registered at Kochi office in 2013, were of this nature.    Though police or enforcement agencies had prevented many attempts of fake currency smuggling, a huge number of them are still in circulation in Kerala. During calendar year 2014, police seized 623 fake notes of Rs 1,000 denomination, while the Reserve Bank caught 4,616 notes from various bank branches.    In a similar way 7,202 notes of Rs 500 denomination were seized during the same period. Over the years the menace widened. In 2012, the total number of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 fake notes caught in Kerala was only 4,875.This grew to 8,975 notes in 2013 and 12,441 in 2014.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/Demonetisation-move-to-curb-Keralas-underground-economy/articleshow/55343694.cms,kochi
2016-11-10 08:58:00,"Public affected, builders, economists welcome PM's demonetization move","MANGALURU: The demonetization of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday had a telling effect on the public on Wednesday with both banks and ATMs being closed.    The move was aimed at curbing the negative impact of fake currency, black money, corruption and terrorism on the nation's economy, left public in a hopeless position during lunch hours, while getting fuel or getting medical aid.    Private hospitals refused to entertain the demonetized currencies saying they have not got any instructions from the district health officer. The DHO said that he had no instructions from the state. However, with Section 144 in place due to Tipu Jayanti celebrations on Thursday, the footfalls at the hospitals were less. Those who had pay bills were given credit, if they were regulars or were asked to give an undertaking.    There were long queues at all fuel stations and some got short-changed as the bunk personnel did not have change for the demonetized currencies. Most of the vehicle owners, especially two wheelers got their tanks filled up for Rs 500, if the capacity allowed.    Shops, business establishments refused to entertain the demonetised currencies and bakery owners were worried of what impact it would have on the festive season next month, if the confusion was not cleared soon.    Perhaps after the nationalisation of 14 major commercial banks way back in 1969 by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, this is the most significant event in the economic history of India, said Norbert Lobo, associate professor and head of department of economics, St Aloysius College.    ""It is a very powerful move taken by PM Modi to curtail the black economy. No doubt, in the immediate future common people particularly from rural areas will have to face a lot of hardships. The real magnitude of these hardships will depend on the corrective measures to be adopted by the banking sector in the next couple of days,"" he said.    On the positive front, Lobo said that over a period of time, it will give a sharp boost to all formal channels of payment like banking, use of plastic money and other financial institutions that will trigger rapid economic growth. He also foresees that inflation will go down, rupee will strengthen, real estate prices will fall leading to deflationary impact in general. ""The move will also promote cashless and paperless economy in future, thereby, puts a curb on money laundering and counterfeiting and drastically reduce corruption and bribery,"" he noted.    Dharmendra B Mehta, president, Credai, welcomed the decision saying that it will give them a level playing field by insulating them from those manipulating the system with their black money. ""Most of the builders in Tier II do white transactions, so this decision will have no impact. But it will weed out fly-by-night operators who were spoiling the market. This will make the trade better and raise customer confidence and make industry truly an organised sector,"" he said.    He also said the cost of apartments may come down. ""We face pressure from land owners. Now, we can buy land directly and save costs. The land owner was exploiting the situation and making maximum out of the situation, which translates into higher cost of apartments. Because of this, land value will come down when black money goes out of the system,"" he added.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/Public-affected-builders-economists-welcome-PMs-demonetization-move/articleshow/55344654.cms,mangaluru

""Though the Centre had said that Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes would be accepted in petrol bunks and hospitals, many customers were turned away. It is sad to see the plight of the common man,'' Stalin told reporters in the city on Wednesday after attending a party functionary's wedding. A few cadres from other parties, including Tamil Maanila Congress's T R Shanmugasundaram, joined the DMK in the presence of Stalin.    ""If the decision to do away with the currency notes of bigger denominations is likely to help economy of the country, DMK welcomes the move,'' Stalin said. But the Centre should take into account the difficulties faced by the people and take immediate corrective measures to offer them relief, he said.    Stalin, however, also took the opportunity to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the status of his announcement to bring back black money stashed in overseas bank accounts.    Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S Thirunavukkarasar said Congress party welcomed Prime Minister's attempt to weed out black money. But the present move has raised doubts whether it would eliminate black money, he said.    ""The decision to do away with the currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations has severely hit the working class, farmers, housewives, traders and the general public,'' he said.    Thirunavukkarasar said the Centre should ensure that the public can exchange their currency notes in banks or post offices without any hassle.

After waking up in the morning, they had to struggle to get milk, eggs and butter and kept on running from one shop to other in absence of lower denomination currency of 100, 50, 20 and 10 rupees in their pocket.    This situation arose after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination currency notes on Tuesday night.    At Birhana road, jewellers said the impact of the government's decision will be permanent. Pushpendra Jaiswal, a trader said, many traders use only cash for trading. ""We will ask most customers to make payments by card,"" he said.    Meanwhile, following the rumours of IT raid, majority of jewellery shops at Birhana road remained shut for the day.    There was a thin presence of customers at small retail outlets as most of the transactions are made with currency notes of small denominations. However, shops dealing with essential commodities in malls witnessed a good rush of purchasers making payment through debit and credit cards.    Sunil Verma, a teacher in a private school, had to return with empty hands from a grocery shop on Wednesday morning as he had only 500 and 1000 currency notes. ""Who could believe that despite having money in your pocket, you can't even buy a packet of biscuits"", he rued.    Though working at railway reservation counters was normal, but people had to face difficulty in getting lower denomination currency notes.    The private pathologies refused to accept currency notes of 500 and 1000 denominations, but in government hospitals, facilities in many departments crippled due to lack of lower denomination currency notes. The worst area affected in the medical sector was drug stores.    Large queues were seen at petrol pumps where vehicle owners were trying to do away with their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Many people were even seen ferrying petrol in huge containers on rickshaws.    Majority of advocates in Kanpur court welcomed the PM's move. However some advocates were annoyed over difficulty that they had to run from pillar to post to obtain currency notes of small denominations as petty vendors refused to accept Rs 500 currency notes. The registry office was badly affected because due to cash deposit of registration fee there was no one to get his property registered.    Meanwhile, Congress staged protest at Deputy Ka Padav and burnt the effigy of the PM against demonitisation.

The decision also had an impact on eateries, local transport auto-rickshaw, retail owners and jewellers. At many shops, the owners had displayed boards, stating that do not accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. The demonetisation also led to a surge in gold prices from Rs 3,100 per gram to Rs. 3,400.    The jewellery shops were flooded on Tuesday night with customers buying gold. As the news spread, the Gujari area where jewellery shops are located was flooded with cash-rich people to buy gold. However, the same area was completely deserted on Wednesday and shop owners had put boards that Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes will not be accepted.

We cannot declare the amount of transaction, but have maintained proper account and will exchange the notes as per the rules,"" said owner of a jewellery shop based in Gujari.

Impact on retail business    The retail business in the city was also affected as shop owners insisted on currency notes other than Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. People having debit and credit cards opted for electronic transactions and the business was as usual at the shops having this facility.    ""I woke up early in the morning and as usual visited grocery shop to buy eggs and bread. I handed over Rs 500 note which was denied by the grocery shop owner. I searched around four shops but no one was ready to accept the money. Finally, I had to buy grocery on credit,"" said Vishal Shinde, a resident of Rajarampuri.

With the IT department keeping an eye on suspicious transactions, the person involved could be slapped with 30 per cent tax and a huge penalty.    The public must be aware that any person making transactions above Rs 10 lakh in a year into any savings bank account might get issued a notice from the IT department.    Initially there may be some crunch in liquid cash, but people need not fear as this lean phase will soon be over and banks will be operational from November 10.

Many tourists were trapped at other stations and were finding it difficult to return to their native destination.    Families who were holding marriage ceremonies were the worst sufferers.

He also demanded that housewives should be given Rs 5-lakh limit for depositing into home savings    ""BJP promised to get black money stashed abroad but had failed to do so and is now under pressure from the people. So, they have resorted to demonetization without realising the consequences it will have on the poor,"" Mulayam said at a press conference. ""It appears it is aimed at benefiting a handful of business houses in the country at the cost of the poor,"" the SP chief said adding: ""Once the Congress party had imposed emergency. Today the situation is the same, the only difference is that people were not being sent to jail.""    Claiming that the Modi government took the decision in a haste keeping in mind the forthcoming state assembly elections, Mulayam said the move would only backfire as demonetization had come as a bolt from the blue for the poor, the farmers and small-time traders. Asked what would be the implication of such a move on the assembly polls, the SP chief said it would hit the BJP hard.    ""The SP supports all government efforts to unearth black money, but this decision is leading to disastrous results for farmers and small traders,"" Mulayam said, adding that move was anti-poor. ""People are committing suicide and burning currency notes and the situation will only worsen in the days to come. Marriage season is under way and people are concerned how they would get their daughters married with such restrictions on withdrawal of money from banks,"" he said.    Mulayam said most of the opposition parties were against the decision of the Modi government but were quiet on the issue. ""They must come together and voice their concern because it has hit the poor hard. ""Farmers who have sold off their harvest and don't have bank accounts, have no where to go.

2016-11-11 10:47:00,Demonetization deals blow to computer hardware biz,"PANAJI: The Union government's move to restrict high denomination notes and withdrawal of cash may well be another nail in the coffin for computer hardware retailers and smartphone sellers. The government's attempt to promote cashless transactions and demonetize high value notes serves as a double whammy for computer hardware stores.    Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement on November 8 that 500 and 1,000 notes would cease to be legal, sales at all major electronic and computer hardware retailers have hit rock bottom.    ""This move is very much welcome, but it's a challenge for computer merchandisers,"" Mandar Manjarekar of Intech Computers said.    The advent and adoption of e-commerce has hurt brick-and-mortar computer hardware stores.    Unable to compete with the massive discounts and low taxation offered by online giants, like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon, computer retailers are forcedto decrease their margins and offer freebies to walk-in customers.    Currently, retailers profit from a 3%-5% margin on laptops, desktop computers and accessories. The adoption of cashless transactions through debit cards or credit cards eats into this margin as the retailer has to pay 1.8%-2% bank commission on each transaction.    ""If card payments are to work, there should be no bank commission for debit cards and the charge for credit cards should be less than 1%,"" Manjarekar said.    The owner of a computer hardware and accessories store said that his sales had fallen by 50%. ""I have had to turn away several customers who came in with 500 and 1,000 notes. If it is a small amount its OK, but for large amounts we cannot accept as banks will start asking questions now,"" he said.    The fear of losing hard earned money while doing online purchases ensured that computer hardware stores continued to see footfalls every month. That fear will slowly dissipate now as plastic money becomes the norm, retailers said.    Syscon Computers, which sells 4-5 laptops per day on an average has seen the numbers drop.    The Mobile Store reported a complete slowdown. ""As it is customers are few and we have to depend on talk time recharge but now even those have stopped. We have had no sale in the last couple of days,"" the store manager said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Demonetization-deals-blow-to-computer-hardware-biz/articleshow/55361364.cms,goa

In an interview with Adarsh Jain, he spoke about the need to change the country's tax policies, regulation of real estate sector and the city's business potential.    It's your first personal venture in Coimbatore. Why real estate?    Indians invest heavily in three things -- education, houses and marriage. Being my native place, I wanted to invest in real estate first.    Real estate is dull in India and many completed projects in Coimbatore are struggling to sell off their units.    That is the feeling in general. But, I feel that quality is the key here. Many realtors are infamous for shady work and poor quality. That is why I have carefully chosen my construction partner.    What do you think about the demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 currencies?    It is a bold move. I think this would pave the way for cashless transactions in the years to come. And, I see this as a big business opportunity. The country should consider investing in fintech.    India is the fastest growing economy. What according to you will be crucial to fuel this growth?    The country is known for its red tape and it often hinders administration. It takes a lot of time for the public to understand these rules which are tedious to follow. Rules are essential, but they must be simplified, like it is in America. I also think that the country should revise its tax reforms. The cap on levying income tax should be a minimum of Rs10lakh and the tax rate should be 20%.    What are areas you are planning to invest in the near future?    I'm interested in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence machines and fintech. These are the areas that will drive the industry's future.

Travancore Devaswom Board president Prayar Gopalakrishnan said that Sabarimala pilgrims could find it difficult to arrange for cash and to secure lower-value notes during the upcoming Sabarimala season which begins on November 16.    He said there are chances that the liquidity crunch during the crucial pilgrimage season could even impact the revenue collection at the temple.    He said that the board would request for a special permission, for it to extend the deadline for exchange of the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, through banks, from December 31 to March 31, 2017 as many temples under the board by custom have specific dates for opening their `hundis'.    ""The mandala season will start in a week. In the current situation, the pilgrims are likely to face difficulties to exchange currency or to withdraw notes from banks for their travel. The authorities should make arrangements to ensure that pilgrims don't face any problems in getting adequate cash needed. The board would also examine if we can make arrangements to help pilgrims in this regard by opening special counters,"" he said.    Authorities of Malabar Devaswom Board, which has around 1,400 temples under it, said it will issue directions to the temples to open their hundis and deposit the withdrawn notes in the banks during the 50day window period itself.    ""We have decided to issue directions in this regard as around 800 small temples under the board, falling under C and D categories, normally open their hundis once in six months or just once in a year,"" Sajeev Maroli, president of Malabar Devaswom Board said.    He added that temples have stopped accepting the old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations for offerings.    ""But some devotees are putting them as offerings in the boxes and we can't do anything about it,"" he said.

Taking up the issue with governor ESL Narasimhan, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao expressed extreme displeasure on the matter in a nearly two-hour long meeting with the governor at the Raj Bhavan.    The chief minister told the governor that the immediate impact of the demonetisation was a whopping loss of revenue anywhere between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 2,000 crore a month.    Just in two days after the demonitisation announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, land registrations in Telangana fell from an average of 3,000 a day to 150 on Wednesday and 300 on Thursday. Similarly, against the daily average of 3,000 new vehicle registrations, the numbers fell to 1,700 and 1,100 in these two days, the CM informed the governor.    The chief minister is learnt to have told the governor that the Centre's decision is set to severely impact the real estate sector as well as excise and luxury tax collections.    Hitting out at the NDA government over tax devolution to Telangana, Chandrasekhar Rao told the governor that the state was to receive Rs 13,995 crore in 14 equal instalments of Rs 997 crore each, which was the case for the first six months of this financial year. However, this month, the Centre released only Rs 585 crore.

Apart from the huge crowds thronging banks, most retail shops and eateries were close to empty. A few shops had remained closed for the day as they had run out of cash.    There were long queues in front of banks. The early birds were lucky to get the new Rs 2000 note. Most others got only the old Rs 100 notes. By the end of the day, banks even ran out of Rs100 notes. ""Since morning, a colleague of mine has been hunting for a single Rs 100 note with no luck,"" said R Rathinam from Anna Nagar.    For many small time traders who spent hours together in queues, it was a pleasant surprise to get Rs 2000 notes from the banks.    ""I went to the bank to exchange my old notes for legal tender so that I could run my mobile shop. They gave me two Rs2000 notes, the maximum amount I could get. But I need Rs100 notes,"" said G Murali.    Severe shortage of currency notes impacted the liquidity of traders on Thursday.    ""Even if we accept the old currencies, we can only deposit them in banks.

Only a few customers were lucky to fill their purses with the new currency notes... most had to return with Rs100, Rs50 and Rs10 notes.    Even before banks could open, there were long queues in front of both nationalised and private bank branches. People rushed to the banks very early in the morning, hoping to get the new notes.    ""I was doubtful they even had adequate Rs100 notes in stock. I think it will take a few more days for the banks to get the new notes. But I needed some cash today so I visited the bank this morning,"" said R Naveen from Srinivasa Nagar.    The situation was similar in rural areas too. Customers thronged the banks to exchange their cash for valid currency. They were requested to fill a special slip with details including name, identity proof, denomination and signature. The illiterate people had to depend on others to fill out their forms. In some banks there was a shortage of request forms. Thus customers had to go to the photocopy shop and get a form for Rs5.    Several banks ran dry after a few hours and had to restrict transactions to deposits only. ""We provided change for first two hours after which we had shortage of currency notes in Rs100 denominations. So, we had to entertain only cash deposits,"" said a private bank manager requesting anonymity.    Only very few people got the new notes on the first day. ""Most customers asked for the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes. But we are yet to receive the new notes today,"" said a cashier at a nationalised bank in Thillai Nagar. Likewise, the shortage of Rs100 notes forced some banks to give change in Rs50 and Rs20 notes. People accepted what ever the banks could give them.    Anticipating the pressure, the police had deployed personnel in almost all the banks to regulate the crowd. It was a hectic day and many banks were forced to keep open till 5pm. Since ATMs are expected to be functional from today, it would ease the crowd in banks.    City post-offices were also buzzing with activity as customers exchanged their invalid notes. In Trichy district, exchange of notes took place in 65 branches including the head and sub-post offices.    In the head post office, the customers waited in line from 10am. However, the post office administration had put up a notice board stating that customers could get notes exchanged only after noon. The banks provided notes in Rs100, Rs50 and Rs10 denominations, to the post offices to carry out the exchange process. The delay was because of the time taken to get cash from the banks. It started accepting deposits from 10am itself. As of now, the post offices have not received the new currencies.

The unprecedented move of scrapping the currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations was not merely an assault on the black money hoarders but also housewives believed to be setting aside petty amount of cash from the total sum given to run the household. This little amount, concealed from everyone, usually grows as time passes and is used in the time of needs.    The monetary treasure stashed away in secret places have now been unveiled by the housewives as it is of no worth unless exchanged.    TOI caught up with some of the housewives who hailed the government's decision despite their lives coming to a standstill considering the impact but at the same time lamented revealing their personal savings which came handy during emergencies.    ""It is a bold and appreciable move by our government and we are all happy about it. But as housewives, we have been saving money over the lifetime for crucial days and we would obviously not want our husbands to know about it. Since these currency notes are now obsolete hence we are bound to get them exchanged through our husbands. But, we are simply hoping that our better halves would respect the cause of our savings and dutifully return the exchanged money and forget about it,"" said Savita Pandey, a housewife.    Another homemaker, Sulekha Singh termed the hidden savings as 'stree dhan' (woman's treasure) and said that it was their 'security money' to be used as and when they pleased. ""Husbands are aware of these savings because as the family in-charge we need to keep a limited amount aside to take care of needs during emergencies, she ""said.    Similar views were echoed by another housewife, Rahsmi Kediya, who lauded the PM's decision. ""As far as personal savings is concerned, everyone has their own savings but I have never hidden notes in kitchen jars or secret places so its not big a problem for me,"" she said, adding that no housewife should have savings of more than 2-2.5 lakhs as this saving is often used to buy jewelleries or for shopping.    ""Though, it has caused inconvenience to many, things will soon get normalised in a couple of days,"" said housewife Renu Agrawal.    Some of the housewives also highlighted the shortcomings of the move. ""Ever since the announcement I am facing difficulties stepping out as there is no change to pay to the cab driver, vendors or maids. There will be rush at banks for first few days.

2016-11-12 01:00:00,"Single screens’ biz affected, but multiplex footfall to remain steady even after demonetization","Loss, profit or no audiences for this Friday's movie releases? Will cash-less moviegoers go in for online ticket booking or ditch their movie plans altogether? These were the questions on most cinema hall owner's minds across the NCR when the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was announced. When we spoke to exhibitors, they told us that there is no one clear trend. While single screens are facing losses after the move, at multiplexes, where tickets are usually booked online, the situation doesn't look as grim. This week, two films shifted their release dates, but three other films still hit the screens.    READ ALSO:  Film ticket booking: NCR prefers the online wayNot your usual Friday box office  With no queues, no rush and no housefull halls, it definitely wasn't just another Friday at the box office. Cinema hall owners tell us that 'Rock On 2', which released yesterday and is a film that many youngsters would normally go for, could've definitely done better had it been just a regular Friday.    Yogesh Raizada, corporate head, Wave Cinemas, tells us, ""Everybody's business is down - shop owners, traders, as well as ours. I believe that business is likely to affected only by 30-40%, because cash transactions are almost nil. Cinema counters are all about Rs 500 notes, but having said that, online transactions have jumped.""    Exhibitors also tells us that single screen cinema halls are the most affected, as a majority of moviegoers tend to buy tickets right at the ticket counter. Hence, low-budget films like 'Dongri Ka Raja' and language films like 'Chaar Sahibzaade: Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur', which released yesterday and have a strong hold only in certain areas, are likely to see a dip in ticket sales.  Thanks to online booking, cinema business won't be affected  Multiplex owners say that the demonetization has highlighted the benefits of booking tickets online. Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Cinemas, says, ""In the last few years, we've observed a growing trend in the online booking of tickets. Currently, 44% of our customers make online transactions, and 18% of our customers pay via debit cards, so a total of 63% people aren't paying in cash. We believe that this 44% will go up to 55%, and the total number of people transacting online will go up to 75% in the next few months. Hence, we believe the demonetization won't have an impact on the footfall at cinema halls. After the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was announced, we decided to make it beneficial for customers.""    PVR has waived convenience fees on all the movie tickets that are booked online for the next one month, while Paytm has also come up with offers like 'Buy one ticket, get one free'. Talking about more such offers, Marzdi Kalianiwala, VP-marketing and business intelligence, BookMyShow, says, ""We're certain that the demonetization will encourage more users to explore the benefits of online transactions. We are providing new offers and discounts for transactions through our 'My Wallet' feature, which has seen a 400% increase in the last few days.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Single-screens-biz-affected-but-multiplex-footfall-to-remain-steady-even-after-demonetization/articleshow/55375978.cms,delhi
2016-11-12 01:09:00,"Demonetisation move visionary, says Rajnath","Lucknow: Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Friday categorically denied that the demonetisation decision had been taken in haste. Reacting to the Opposition parties' allegation, Singh also brushed aside the view that the government should have provided a window while implementing the ban on high denomination currency.    ""The decision was well-thought over and had a vision to it,"" said Singh, who was the chief guest at All-India Commerce Association's 69th conference at Lucknow University. Talking throughout his 30-minute speech on finance, he predicted that India was poised to become a super economic power in the next 15 to 20 years.    Drawing a parallel with China's economy, Rajnath said it was almost the same time when India got its freedom and China came out of its internal strife. Economies of both the countries progressed at a consistent pace until 1980. However, post-1980, the Chinese incumbent worked efficiently, turning the country into a global economic power, but India lagged behind and its growth rate dipped, barring between 1998 and 2004, he said. Interestingly, that was the time when the BJP-led NDA government under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee was at the helm in the country.    Since 2014, India's economy has began progressing fast with the growth rate pegged at around 7.9%, Singh said, adding that the way Modi-led NDA government is working, India's growth rate would reach the double digit mark.    Referring to the government's latest decision, Singh said that the Union government had been taking every possible step to curb the black money menace. Demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 denomination currency notes was one such step. Reacting to the allegation made by BSP and SP, without taking the parties' names, Singh said that some people have been saying the decision was hasty, which is not the fact. The decision has been given a lot of consideration and was visionary, Singh said.

2016-11-12 11:52:00,"Demonetization hits matka, some agents take ‘holiday’","MAPUSA: The government may have failed to curb matka, but the recent demonetization move has dealt a severe blow to the local form of gambling. Though matka dens continued to function across Goa, the main operator is believed to have ceased operations till November 20, due to the acute shortage of lower denomination notes.    Sources said the absence of lower denominations of currency has been making it difficult for handlers to pay out prize money to winners. While bookies were believed to be accepting 500 and 1,000 notes till Friday, winners allegedly refused to accept the currencies. In fact, several customers reportedly inquired what denomination of notes they would be given if they won, much before placing their respective bets.    Matka handlers generally accept bets for 12 different bazaars (operators), namely, 'Time Bazaar', 'Diamond', 'Milan Day', 'Rajdhani Day', 'Kalyan', 'Milan Night', 'Rajdhani Night', 'Main Mumbai', 'Main Mumbai Day', 'New Milan Day', 'News Express' and 'Malamal'.    In Goa, 'Kalyan' and 'Main Mumbai', are believed to be the most popular bazaars, generating crores of rupees in turnovers per day. People can bet money on 'Kalyan' from early morning till around 2pm. The 'open number' (first digit) is declared at about 4pm and the 'close number' (second digit) after 6.30pm. Business for 'Main Mumbai', on the other hand, begins at 6.30pm, with the 'open number' declared at midnight and the 'close number' in the wee hours of the following day. Both bazaars are closed on Sundays and some holidays.    Sources said that owing to difficulties in obtaining currency of lower denominations, the 'Main Mumbai' bazaar was shut down by its handlers since Thursday night and will likely be non-functional till November 20.    While matka handlers termed it a 'holiday', sources said the decision to shut down 'Main Mumbai' was taken to stop the intake and payment of currency till the demonetization dust settled.    A bookie from Baina admitted that the Centre's move to make 500 and 1,000 illegal tender had dealt a huge blow to the business and deterred prospective players from betting ""as they were apprehensive of being given old notes"". The agent disclosed that while business on regular days would generate as much as 50,000 to 1 lakh daily, the turnover has now dwindled to a paltry 5,000.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Demonetization-hits-matka-some-agents-take-holiday/articleshow/55379539.cms,goa

The news report, based on sources, was carried on the front page of the Kanpur edition of the newspaper on October 27, and said that Rs 2000 currency notes were likely to be introduced. It also said that the government was contemplating a harsh measure against Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination notes, indicating that they might go out of circulation.    The report said that as the Central government was not satisfied with the result of the voluntary declaration scheme, it was contemplating tougher measures to smoke out the black money. For this, the Center had already made preparation to introduced Rs 2000 currency notes with high security features, the report mentioned.    The report was filed from Kanpur, which has the RBI's regional centre, and was taken on the front page locally, but other editions of the paper pushed it inside. ""The story was filed on the Dhanteras day and the entire paper was full of advertisement, so this story couldn't get proper display.

2016-11-12 12:09:00,Defaulters use demonetized notes to pay off old taxes,"NAGPUR: A Mahal resident rushed to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation's (NMC) Gandhibag Zone office and paid property tax of Rs1,80,778 which is pending since 2008-09. Similarly, another person from Gokulpeth paid Rs3.30 lakh water bill due for the last 11 years at the Dharampeth Zone office on Friday.    With the extension to use demonetized notes up to Monday, the government departments are hopeful of recovering more taxes. State government had asked all departments to give two-hourly updates on money recovered.    The Mahal person's annual property tax is Rs12,618. He had refused to pay the tax since 2008-09 despite numerous reminders. The stamps and registration department continued to incur a revenue loss for the third consecutive day.    There were many other defaulters too who were keen to pay government dues. After the state government approval, the NMC property tax, NIT, OCW, MSEDCL, SPANCO and other government departments accepted these demonetized notes up to Friday midnight.    The NMC's daily collection is usually around Rs75 lakh. On Friday, the collection rose to Rs5.48 crore till 6pm, which is a sevenfold hike.    With the counters continuing to be remain open till midnight, more moolah is likely to be raked in.    Similarly, NMC's private operator OCW used to recover water bills of around Rs30 lakh per day. On Friday, the recovery increased to Rs60.87 lakh up to 8pm and is expected to touch Rs70 lakh by midnight.    The MSEDCL's Nagpur urban circle (Congress Nagar and Butibori division) too witnessed double recovery. The daily collection is around Rs90 lakh. It was Rs2.35 crore up to 9pm.    The MSEDCL has collected around Rs45 crore from entire Vidarbha as against the daily collection of Rs20 crore. The power company is also getting arrears which are pending since a long time from consumers.    MSEDCL has decided to keep open counters up to 7pm on November 12 and 13 and up to November 14 midnight.    SPANCO's (power franchisee for 3 divisions in city) collection too increased two times. The daily collection is Rs3.5-4 crore and it increased to Rs7-8 crore per day up to 9pm.    NIT's revenue too doubled from ground rent and Gunthewari charges. The NIT's collection at counter situated at its head office is Rs3 lakh per day. It increased to Rs6.37 lakh on Friday up to 6pm. The revenue can be much more as NIT accepts cash only up to Rs50,000 at this counter. Large chunk of payment comes through deposits in banks.    However, the sale deeds at the stamps and registration department dropped to 150 as against an average of 250 per day.

2016-11-12 09:17:00,Modi’s demonetization set to cripple Naxalites financially,"NAGPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to hit terrorism hard through demonetization seems to have dealt a blow to the nation's internal security threat, Naxalism, too.    With intelligence and security machineries on their toes as per plan, the Naxalites will find it difficult to launder their cash dumps containing several hundred crores. They cannot transfer such substantial cash from secret locations in the forest, known only to top ranking cadres, and exchange them for new currency at banks. A section of the security forces feel that Naxalites might make a desperate attempt through Jan militia supporters, front organizations working as NGOs, and even their cadres masquerading as villagers, to launder the money in banks where they have presence.    Sources in the banking sector said there have been huge deposits in Gadchiroli district. The accounts which received substantial deposits are bound to be scrutinized. Inspector general of police, state Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell chief Shivaji Bodkhe said close surveillance is being kept near banks and other financial institutes in Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia and Bhandara districts.    ""The security forces have been alerted and checks are being conducted to intercept unaccounted cash. The banking sector too has been taken into confidence to share information about suspicious deposits and questionable flow of cash into any account,"" said Bodkhe.    Sources in the security agencies claimed that unaccounted cash Rs1,500 crores, amassed by the Naxalites, may be left stranded as security agencies are keeping a close eye on the movements in and around the affected regions. In Central India's hinterlands, controlled by the Naxalites' Dandakaranya special zonal committee (DKSZC), it is estimated that around Rs50 crore may be at the disposal of the rebels. The cash collection from Gadchiroli, Maharashtra's most affected part in eastern Vidarbha, which is also under DKSZC, is around Rs25-30 crores.    Inspector general of police, Nagpur range, Ravindra Kadam said that the demonetization would hit urban networks of Naxals adversely. ""The urban cadres depend upon their rural counterpart for monetary support, which would be affected,"" he said. ""Another problem for Naxalites is that most of their money is dumped in secret places, from where ferrying the cash at such short notice in such tight surveillance is not easy,"" said Kadam.    Security agency sources claimed that extortion from civil contractors, traders and business houses, including mining companies, get the most party funds for Naxalites. In Gadchiroli, tendu leave collection contractors and bamboo cutters share substantial amount as funds. The Naxalites also collect party funds from tribal population through a scheme 'work-a-day' in which the rebels claim one day wage from the workers.    Superintendent of police, Gadchiroli, Abhinav Deshmukh said the problems for Naxals are a logical outcome of the demonetization process. ""Police are working on inputs and also conducting checks,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Modis-demonetization-set-to-cripple-Naxalites-financially/articleshow/55379177.cms,nagpur
2016-11-12 06:00:00,Online biz hit by demonetisation drive,"Visakhapatnam: Much to the dismay of online businesses and tech startups offering various services in the Port City, the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has hit business in the last couple of days.    Even though online services have the option of payment through debit or credit cards, net banking or digital wallets, online businesses said they have suffered a drop in business as majority of the orders are usually based on cash-on-delivery option. Apart from startups offering services such as household repairs, even those supplying groceries too have taken a hit due to the demonetisation drive.    ""We used to get around 20-30 orders on an average and majority of these were cash-on-delivery orders. In the last two days, we received only about 5-10 orders which were made through card payment,"" said a representative of Quick Pebbles, which deals in household services such as plumbing and repairs of electrical devices. ""Most of our workers belong to the unorganised sector and the value of the work is known only after it is completed. So, we prefer to take cash after completing the job. Due to this demonetisation, people don't have smaller denominations to offer and we are not receiving any orders,"" he added.    Another startup involved in supply of groceries and food commodities too faced a similar issue. ""About 70 per cent of our orders are based on the cash-on-delivery option. We are now facing an 80 per cent drop in orders. Unlike the bigger funded startups, we can survive only if we have a daily flow of orders,"" said a member of Vizag-based startup UrbanBasket.    Meanwhile, cab aggregators too have stopped taking Rs 500 notes due to which customers are shying away from ordering cabs for daily travel. ""Usually, we have around 10-12 trips per day, but on Thursday and Friday, I was hardly able to get one or two rides. We are asking people to use options like card, but many of them are not aware of it and because of that we are getting hit,"" a cab driver in the city said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Online-biz-hit-by-demonetisation-drive/articleshow/55378513.cms,visakhapatnam
2016-11-12 17:56:00,Why’s Mamata Banerjee against demonetization?,"KOLKATA: Who is right — Modi or Mamata? Opinions are divided. While the public initially hailed the Prime Minister's stance to wipe out fake notes and curb black money, the liquidity crunch in the last two days, the queues at banks and the harassment have resulted in a swing in the public mood. Those who initially winked at Mamata Banerjee for her barbs against the move can't discount her anymore. Most of them are the nuts and bolts of the robust cash economy running in the country (including black money) that far outnumber those who operate through banks and opt for electronic money transfers.    Even BJP president Amit Shah has been forced to take note of Mamata's views. ""I have heard that Mamtaji has also opposed this. But what I fail to understand is that this scheme is against blackmarketeers, hoarders and terrorists. This has nothing to do with the poor. Instead, it is for the benefit of the poor. I don't know whose cause Mamtaji is espousing,"" Shah said at a press meet in New Delhi.    On the ground, the salaried middle class, the pensioner and the small trader are slowly running out of patience due to the inadequate financial infrastructure. Bank officials working overtime to cater to this huge crowd are running short of cash. Mamata is trying to address this crowd in a language it understands. ""The Modi government has led an assault on the lakshmir jhapi,"" Mamata said on Thursday, pointing to the plight of the vegetable vendor or tea garden worker who sustains his family on the daily income. Now political parties — Samajwadi Party, BSP, AAP and even Congress — have joined in protest of the move. Mamata's arch rival Left had announced that the demonetisation can at best target only a small portion of the black money without touching the big fishes. Mamata is thus upping her ante with an eye on the millions catering to the cash economy because numbers count in democracy. ""While doing so, she is taking care of party-dominated syndicates and party men who have back money acquired through chit funds,"" said CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra.    The criticism apart, the Trinamool chief is slowly consolidating her support base and trying to win back the small traders who went with BJP in the last assembly polls.    As of now, Mamata has with her at least 90-odd members across political parties to raise a ruckus in Rajya Sabha.    Left, too, can't stay away from the debate. ""We have a consistent view against black money and have a corrective proposal. We will express our view in Rajya Sabha in case of a debate,"" said CPM leader in Parliament Mohammad Salim.    Whatever the argument, chances are that Trinamool and Left might be seen on the same page during a debate on black money in Parliament in the winter session.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Whys-Didi-against-demonetisation/articleshow/55378644.cms,kolkata

""We are aware that in the wake of insurgencies and running of a parallel economy, which is ruining the backbone of the Indian economy , a major step was necessary . It is true there are initial problems. Any new system will have some initial problems. We don't think this is perennial. We don't find any reason to doubt the bonafides of the central government in implementing demonetization,"" a division bench headed by Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee observed, while dismissing the petition filed by Mohammed Haroon Rasheed, an advocate.

He also claimed a vast majority of people, who are not computer-savvy and don't know how to use the internet, are suffering.

""When the PM announced the move, he had informed all of his friends who had black money and they secured their money,"" the Delhi CM added.

2016-11-13 06:08:00,40% not covered under banking net hurting the most by demonetization,"BENGALURU: ATMs running dry, serpentine queues at banks and post offices, bank staffers working overtime - this is but a short list of grievances being aired by the urban elite and middle classes, inconvenienced by the Centre's move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.    But, one facet of the move that could easily slip under the radar is that 40% of India is outside the ""Ambit of formal banking"", that is they are without a bank account, as conceded by the Centre on June 1, 2016. The 'invisible' 40% can exchange money up to Rs 4,000 just once, until the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reviews the decision a fortnight from the day the Prime Minister made the announcement (Tuesday).    ""The decision will be renewed in 15 days. Until then, yes, we have allowed people to exchange only once,"" RBI spokesperson Alpana Killawala told STOI from Mumbai. She was, however, quick to point out that people could withdraw a maximum amount of Rs 10,000 in a day, and up to Rs 20,000 in a week, albeit from their bank deposits. But, such options don't exist for those like 68-year-old Muniyamma - a single woman with a broken left shoulder, struggling to make ends meet every day - who has no bank account.    A resident of Ulsoor in east Bengaluru, Muniyamma is a domestic help, whose husband left her 47 years ago, and is childless. ""I have saved up nearly Rs 20,000 over many years. I never knew how to do bank work, so I never had an account. I've had no need for one, and now I am stuck with all the cash, but can't use it to buy supplies,"" she said. Although she managed to get her hands on some cash at a government hospital, where she got her arm treated, that has now run out.    According to a study conducted by consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers' in October 2015, a whopping 233 million Indians have no bank accounts, which means that many citizens are likely to be faced with a predicament not unlike Muniyamma's.    Furthermore, a United Nations (UN) report released around the same time highlighted that 43% of the adults with bank accounts made no deposits or withdrawals in the 2014-15 period. Pillamma Thippaiah, 67, who created a bank account with her neighbour's help to register for a widow pension scheme that never materialised, is a case in point. ""I have some money saved up, but it is in cash at home, since I didn't know how to deposit it in the bank,"" Pillamma said.    The plight of Pillamma and Muniyamma in the country's IT Capital serve as indicators to the crisis that the thousands of men and women without a bank account, are likely to be confronted with in the wake of demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes.    Further, a United Nations (UN) report released the same time, points out that 43% of adults with an account made no deposits or withdrawals in the past year. The cases in point here are people like Pillamma Thippaiah, 67, who created a bank account with her neighbour's help to register for a widow pension scheme that has never materialised.    Responding to a specific query about problems likely to be faced by those without bank accounts, Killawala said, ""They can visit the post office and exchange their money."" When asked what they would have to do in the event of needing more than Rs 4,000, she said, ""Do small people want to use more than Rs 4,000? Do they have that much money?""    Reiterating the fact that RBI had factored in all probable issues into account, she added, ""This (exchanging Rs 4,000) is not a life-time offer. We will review the situation in 15 days, and in all likelihood, it will be allowed again.""    Economist and professor at Indian Indistitute of Management-Bangalore (IIM-B), Charan Singh admitted that there were bound to be difficulties for those without bank accounts. However, he pointed out that the merits of the move were greater than the hardships the citizens are experiencing. ""I completely understand the inconvenience faced by the people, but I stand behind the move since its merits will be greater. The move deals with two issues: one, counterfeit currency, which is funding terror organisations, and two, corruption, which the citizens are fighting against on the streets,"" he said.

2016-11-13 06:57:00,CM: BJP’s ‘friends’ got prior info about demonetisation,"New Delhi: Calling the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes a ""huge scam"", CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday demanded an immediate rollback of the decision. He alleged that BJP had tipped off its ""friends"" about the move much before PM Narendra Modi's announcement.    Referring to the deaths, which are believed to have been caused by the ongoing cash crisis and the long queues at ATMs, Kejriwal said that the Centre's move was a ""surgical strike"" on the common man's small savings and not a crackdown on the black marketeers.    Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the CM questioned the ""intention"" of the ruling dispensation behind the decision and alleged that it was a ""deliberate"" attempt to create chaos. ""As a result of this tip-off on demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, there was a massive rise in the amounts of deposits in several public sector banks over the last quarter,"" Kejriwal alleged.    He cited a TV channel's report which pointed out the ""stunning growth in deposits, in contrast with the negative growth in deposits recorded in the previous quarters"". ""From July to September, there had been a sudden jump in deposits of money in banks, which clearly indicates that BJP had told its friends much before the announcement by the PM. In the name of fighting the black money, a huge scam is operating in the country,"" he said.    To substantiate his claim, Kejriwal alleged that Sanjeev Kamboj, who heads BJP's Punjab legal cell, was seen with new of Rs 2,000 notes on social media days before the PM's announcement.    Crores of rupees had been deposited in banks during July-September quarter at a massive level. However, some people would attribute that the huge deposit were done because of recently-concluded I-T declaration scheme, the CM said.    ""Under ITDS, money had to be deposited in the treasury of the central government. But when we talk about demonetisation, cash has been deposited by certain people at massive level in their bank accounts as they were told by BJP much before the announcement on withdrawing high currency notes. Demonetisation will only lead to redistribution of black money,"" Kejriwal added.    Kejriwal claimed that existing ATMs were not designed for notes of new denominations. How will the Centre change ATMs now at a big scale? They knew it very well and they deliberately created this crisis,"" he said.    The Delhi CM posed three questions to the PM and BJP president Amit Shah on withdrawing higher currency notes. ""What according to the PM is the definition of black money? Have India's top industrialists amassed black money or the common man like farmers, rickshaw-pullers, shopkeepers and labourers did? BJP should disclose a list of all its friends whom it had told about the demonetisation much before the PM's announcement,"" he said.    ""Thirdly, the BJP should also come out with a list of touts who are taking commission from common people in exchanging their invalid notes with new ones, cashing in on the situation and where is the money collected by them going?""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/CM-BJPs-friends-got-prior-info-about-demonetisation/articleshow/55393764.cms,delhi

Not just cricket, bookmakers had been accepting bets on the US presidential elections, and held Hillary Clinton as the favourite to become the 45th president of the US and become the first woman in the White House.    ""The demonetization came one day ahead of the US presidential elections results, and as Donald Trump emerged the surprise winner it saved us from taking final bets. We halted payments to winners for now as we don't much valid currency notes but we will pay them in the near future,"" a city-based bookmaker said on condition of anonymity.    Meanwhile sources in the bookie circles said it will take a while for betting to restart, especially on cricket, as big names have gone underground, probably to settle their ""black money"" troubles.    Gujarat has always been a hub for cricket bookies, who occasionally take bets on other important events as well. The enforcement directorate had recently busted a cricket betting racket, allegedly worth some Rs 4,000 crore, at a farmhouse on the outskirts of Vadodara city.    ""The arrests of some big names in the racket shows the magnitude of the illegal cricket betting business in Gujarat.

The adoption of card-based payments has also seen an increase and banking officials expect digital payment to gain further traction in the coming days. ""We saw debit card growth by nearly 60%. We believe that cards as well as internet banking will continue to grow henceforth,"" senior vice-president for cards and acquiring business at Axis Bank, Sangram Singh, said.

However, it is retailers across the city who are bearing the brunt of the decision, with their sales going down drastically in the past four days.    The average number of customers at the MG Road outlet of fashion retail store, Pantaloons has dropped from 400 every day to 200. ""Around 40% of our transactions were in cash, acccounting for about Rs 40,000 daily. Now, we get only Rs 1,000 in cash, while the rest are using debit cards,"" says store manager, Ramesh.

2016-11-13 06:55:00,Great Indian demonetizers made in Gujarat,"They say that to engineer and execute a major economic stunner, you need a few Guja ratis. While the Gujarati connection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and current RBI governor, Urjit Patel, is quite evident in the ongoing demonetization drive, three Gujaratis had executed a similar surgical strike on black money, 38 years ago, in 1978.    The new Janata party regime led by PM Morarji Desai had just stormed into power riding on the popular wave against corruption and nepotism of the Indira Gandhi-led Congress party soon after the Emergency. On January 16, 1978, Union finance minister H M Patel, went on air at 9 am to announce demonetization of Rs 5,000, Rs 10,000 and Rs 1,000 notes.    H M Patel was a native of Dharmaj in Anand. Then Prime Minister Morarji Desai belonged to Bhadeli in Valsad, while the then 14th RBI governor, I G Patel belonged to Palana village in Gujarat's Kheda district -the same place from where the current RBI governor, Urjit Patel's family , hails. Interestingly, both these RBI governors had to execute the task of demonetization within two months of assuming office.    A striking similarity between the two demonetization drives is that both took off just a few months prior to assembly elections in seven states.    Back in 1978, there were elections in AP , Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Meghalaya and Mizoram, starting from June 1978. The current demonetization drive is taking place when there are assembly elections scheduled for Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttarakhand, UP , Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh starting in 2017.    In his memoirs, 'Glimpses of Indian Economic Policy', I G Patel admits that he went along with demonetization `reluctantly'. Patel claims in his book that he had pointed out to the finance min ister H M Patel that ""People who have black money on a substantial scale rarely keep it in cash."" The present RBI governor, Urjit Patel, restricted himself by saying, ""RBI has been concerned about the growing menace of fake Indian currency notes which has been increasing in numbers.""    In Gujarat, during the two days of the 1978 drive, Surat had emerged as the district with the highest deposits of demonetized notes.    An SBI bank official is quoted in a TOI report (March 10, 1978) that 6,250 people had deposited notes worth Rs 2.77 crore.    Surprised at a large number of donations to temples, trusts and institutions in Gujarat, Union finance minister H M Patel undertook a tour on January 19, 1978 to warn that institutions accepting donations in high value demonetized notes should prove that they had received them before the government had passed the ordinance. The impact was felt in most markets--diamond, bullion, and dyes and chemicals - where use of unaccounted high denomination notes was substantial.    On January 20, 1978, TOI reported that there were long queues outside 16 collection centres in Ahmedabad even till 6.30 pm and some Rs 20 lakh was collected during that time. It was also alleged that in Bhadra and others areas Rs 1,000 notes were being offered for Rs 200 and yet there were no buyers. Bullion traders claimed that demonetization had pushed gold prices up from Rs 692 to Rs 710 per 10 grams.    Allegations of ""leaks"" ahead of the demonetization drive had flown thick during the Morarji regime as well. Former PM Indira Gandhi, during a press meet in Bangalore in February 1978, had said, ""People in `certain circles' knew about the step well in advance and had got high-value notes exchanged."" When a TOI correspondent asked her how much money she had lost after demonetization, Indira shot back: ""I have nothing to lose.""    Indira was seconded by former finance minister C Subramaniam, who said that rival netas were the real targets.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Great-Indian-demonetizers-made-in-Gujarat/articleshow/55395206.cms,ahmedabad

Addressing media here on Saturday, Shabbir Ali said the NDA government's late-night decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes had hit the common man hard. ""Thousands of people have been queuing up outside banks to exchange the old notes. They have been put to hardship for no fault of theirs.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi from acting against 648 influential Indians whom the Centre had identified as holding accounts in Swiss banks. He alleged that the Centre's hasty decision had also exposed the blatant lie of 'surprise decision'. ""Those with black money received prior information about the demonetization decision. This explains why the rich are not queuing up outside banks. About 100 crore people have been affected by the thoughtless action of the Centre,"" Shabbir Ali said.    He also said the Centre must reconsider its decision on the Rs 2.5 lakh ceiling for deposits in accounts. ""This is not in the interests of the public. The decision has driven several genuine income tax payers to the brink.

2016-11-13 09:22:00,Government's challenge after demonetisation: Keeping unaccounted money handlers at bay,"In 12 hours, there couldn't have been a starker difference to jeweller Hansraj Mehta's fortunes. At 9 pm on November 8, just hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, his store in north Mumbai was besieged by customers buying all that was available, paying with wads of currency, seeking to convert cash into more agreeable holdings in gems and jewellery.    The next morning was just the opposite — an almost empty store, with barely a dozen walk-ins and just a couple of low-value purchases. ""There's lots of cash floating around and people are now scared they will lose their money in this fight against black money,"" says Mehta. ""We expect to be back in business next week.""    For the next couple of days, the bustling market where this store is located — and thousands across the country — where cash is the primary source of income, will see business dealings plummet. From Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai to Sadar Bazaar in Delhi and Krishna Rajendra Market in Bengaluru, businessmen sweated on the fate of their enterprises.    A dealer of PVC pipes in the Bengaluru market, who bills Rs 1.5 crore a month and is dependent on cash for 80% of his payments, spent most of the week waiting for customers. ""In three days, I had barely 10 customers walk in and of those just five made small orders,"" he grumbles.    Across the country, businessmen saw the rise and fall of their enterprises. Nikhilesh Dhawan's business too took a pounding. A Samsung dealer in Jagatpuri in Delhi saw just three or four customers making purchases a day after the big announcement, paying by cheque; in happier times, 80% of his purchases were in cash. About 10 km away, in upscale Khanna Market, Rajesh Luthra, promoter of RK Vision, a consumer electronics store, sold goods worth Rs 31 lakh until midnight, doubling his daily sales.    Otherwise fussy customers bought air purifiers, refrigerators and LED televisions in a tearing hurry to dispose of their cash. After that storm, a lull quickly descended on Wednesday, with barely 15 bills raised, compared with over 100 on a normal business day.  Honey, Have You Shrunk the Money?  As businessmen, heavily reliant on cash, fretted about their wildly swinging fortunes, most people on the street spent much of Thursday and Friday standing in queues trying to get their hands on these new notes or figuring out how to manage with the limited, legal currency at their disposal. Pradeep Kumar, a painter in suburban Mumbai, spent three hours on Thursday evening and a couple more on Friday before being able to finally withdraw money to pay his dues.    For all of Wednesday, Kumar managed with Rs 60, before empty pockets compelled him to queue up. ""This is a disservice to the poor who have to waste hours during a work day hunting for money,"" Kumar says.    This pain is amplified away from big cities. In the small town called Ezhukone in Kerala, about 20 km from Kollam, Anitha Radhakrishnan, a 59-year old retired employee, uses cash to pay for her daily milk, vegetables and fish. Following the sudden demonetisation, she was left with Rs 259, with which she had to manage all her immediate purchases, with neither her neighbourhood grocer nor the pharmacist wired to accept cards or digital payments. To make ends meet, she pleaded with an auto driver to ferry her to and from the chemist to buy medicines she and her husband urgently required.    She held on to her last few tenners and a desperate hope that the ATM-less Wednesday would pass without incident or emergency.  Hoard Unlimited  If Radhakrishnan spent her time wondering how to manage with little cash, Manish Kumar (name changed), in his cramped office in the Mumbai suburb of Andheri, is wondering how to dispose of the cash he has hoarded. An agent for the local road transport office, he keeps up to Rs 5 lakh in a locked cupboard in office and more at home. He has managed to buy some jewellery and electronics goods, but faces tough choices ahead. With fixed deposits over Rs 2.5 lakh facing tough scrutiny, that's another avenue shut, for now.    Away from the chaos of managing too much or too little cash, experts divided on the efficacy of the long-term game out black money and counterfeiting of high-value notes. ""It will tackle black money, corruption, terror money and counterfeiting — multiple with one stone,"" Shah, chairman of financial services company. ""I call it gutsy because it's a move that any political party will know will be difficult and there will be plenty of reasons not to implement.""    Dhruv Phophalia, MD with Alvarez & Marsal, a management consultancy, calls this a great one time action to cleanse the system. While this is a great first move, the Modi government needs to do much more to back this up. ""Thus requires several follow-ups, especially tightening and better enforcement of PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) and deterrence in the form of far stricter punishment to be effective.""    A clampdown on black money may be meaningless with this one-off move. While this may serve as a strong notice of intent, the government faces a series of difficult choices ahead, targeting large sectors such as real estate, which are flush with these funds. ""It is important to ensure the chain of black money doesn't return,"" says Mritunjay Kapur, partner, KPMG India, a management consultancy. In the longer term, to achieve this, the government needs to build on a range of initiatives, including GST, access to bank accounts with initiatives such as Jan Dhan and technology enablers such as Aadhaar, to make a fist of its fight against black money.    If the demonetisation has been a bigbang announcement with some immediate repercussions, it may take more gumption in the long term to strike a body blow in the fight against black money and indeed counterfeit currency. This is because a large chunk of this illicit money is squirrelled away in the form of real estate and jewellery or even overseas, away from the prying eyes of regulators. ""People with malicious intent usually catch up with these changes and are quickly go one step ahead,"" says Reshmi Khurana, managing director, Kroll India, a forensics specialist.    ""As India moves more towards a 'white' economy,' liquidating holdings overseas and stamping out counterfeiting, which thrived on operating in a cash-rich economy, must be key long-term goals.""

The demonetisation policy of the BJP-led NDA government will not curb black money as it continues to exist in the forms of gold and stock exchange deposits, CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran said.    Addressing a 'meet-the-press' programme organised by Kerala Union of Working Journalists here, he denied BJP leaders' allegation that black money to the tune of crores of rupees had been stashed away in cooperative banks in the state.    ""Will demonetisation help in putting an end to blackmoney? Then, what is the means to regulate illegal money in the form of gold and stock exchange deposits?"" Rajendran asked.    ""Modi has been saying for the last two years that he will bring back black money stashed abroad. But, he failed to fulfill his promise and the present demonetisation was an attempt to cover up his failure,"" he charged.    Referring to BJP seeking a probe into money deposited in cooperative banks in the state, the senior CPI leader said the propaganda was part of a calculated move to destroy the cooperative sector, ""a backbone"" of the state's economy.    ""Cooperative banks are being operated with the license of Reserve Bank of India. Cooperative institutions are backbone of the state's agrarian sector and play a crucial role in the state's economy,"" he said, adding that like Kerala, such institutions were significant in Gujarat also.

There have been reports of chaos prevailing in some parts of the country and even deaths occurring.    A child recently succumbed because a doctor refused to attend to him because his parents had only Rs. 500 notes that have been declared no longer legal tender. A distressed woman jumped off the Howrah Bridge because she couldn't manage to get cash from her ATM. Two elderly people died while standing in long queues in Kerala.    Poor management has given rise to large scale disenchantment.    Tehseen Poonawalla, an entrepreneur and political commentator, has claimed that the government is colluding with the real culprits.    In a series of hard-hitting tweets, Poonawalla has alleged that the BJP is laundering black money through the Patanjali Group run by one of its key supporters Baba Ramdev.    He has alleged that the meteoric rise in the sales of Patanjali products is not due to anything else but the BJP's money.    His tweets have incited divided reactions, leading many to claim that Modi's fight against black money is causing unprecedented inconvenience to the ordinary citizen. Some say it's a totally bureaucratic tactic.    Reportedly, the cost involved in the demonetisation of the old currency and replacing them with new ones will be less than the black money being checked.

H    e added that the daily average collection through fines on normal days is around Rs 1.5 lakh, which has decreased to around Rs 15,000 after the announcement came into effect on Wednesday.    Officials also said that though they are keeping a check on people violating traffic rules, they are unable to collect fines from them due to lack of lower denomination notes.    ""Challans being made against those found violating traffic rules allows them to pay their fine in court after a period of time. This also solves the problem of the lack of lower denomination notes,"" officials said.    Traffic police have so far issued e-notices to around 2.6 lakh traffic rule violators in the city. While only 1.1 lakh violators have paid fines for violations, a remaining 1.6 lakh of them are yet to clear their dues.    Traffic police were running a recovery drive and were sending personnel to residences of traffic violators to collect payments.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/Demonetization-affects-collection-of-fines-for-traffic-violations/articleshow/55396417.cms,indore
2016-11-13 10:34:00,IIM-Raipur students hail demonetization,"Raipur: Indian Institute of Management-Raipur students are of the view that demonetization of currency will have a mixed impact on the economy, lead to fall in prices of property and increase cashless transactions.    Speaking at a panel discussion organised by Finatix, the finance club of IIM-Raipur, the speakers pointed out that there is a liquidity crunch in the market and many sectors like realty, banking, IT and e-commerce have been heavily affected. ""Students from the first and second year participated as panel members and expressed their views on the burning issue,"" said Piyush Gaurav, coordinator, Finatix.    Praising the move of the government to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, Swagat Kumar Dash, a PGP second year student, said, ""Kudos to the NDA government for the bold step, which I perceive as one of the biggest reforms post-liberalization era apart from the other big reform GST, which again has been implemented by the government. The long-term effect of the demonetisation step will be positive with a blow to the parallel economy and unorganised sectors involving significant cash transactions.""    He said consumption is likely to go down for the initial few months owing to reduction in currency circulation but that will be more than compensated by pent up demand once the circulation resumes to normal levels. The e-payment sector is the one likely to gain the most, with a significant boost.    Echoing similar views, Arkaprabha Bhattacharya, a PGP first year student said, ""Considering the recent demonetization, the use of cashless transaction will immensely increase. Companies like Visa, MasterCard, and Paytm, who generate revenue through cashless wallets, will have a big time effect.""    Sumit Srivastava, a PGP first year student, said, ""Economy will suffer in this quarter due to low consumption by public owing to cash crunch and uncertainty.""    Kavisha Agarwal, a PGP second year student, opined that the decision came as a blow to black money hoarders. She explained, ""The realty sector is expected to see a fall in prices of property by 20-30 percent in the next 6 months and hence a boost in sales which have stalled for a while now."" D Santosh reckoned that the impact on automobile sector is expected to be moderate and only where cash transaction is involved. He said, ""Luxury segment is the one that will be adversely affected because of e investment of black money. Second hand market would also be adversely affected as the segment is highly unorganised.""    Kewal Krishna, a PGP second year student, was optimistic of the move and said, ""This is a positive step towards transparent and cashless economy. e-commerce as well as startup space will get a boost from this decision.""    Speaking on the challenges of demonetization, Pratik Garg, a PGP first year student, said, ""Some of the challenges for the implementation of demonetization are introduction of higher denomination note of Rs 2000 which might counter the effect to reduce the large value storage of black money.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/IIM-Raipur-students-hail-demonetization/articleshow/55396621.cms,raipur

2016-11-13 11:07:00,Indians stuck in Gulf countries after demonetization,"KANPUR: It is not only people in the country who have been hit by demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, but even the Indians who had recently gone to Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Dubai are finding it difficult to exchange the currency and meet their daily expenses.    The worst hit are those who had gone to perform 'umrah' (lesser pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca, which may be performed at any time of the year) to Saudi Arabia.    Majority of these pilgrims take high denomination Indian currency notes along with them and exchange it there for their daily needs. Many Indian pilgrims who had landed in Mecca after November 8 when Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were demonetized, found themselves stranded with both local money exchangers and banks refusing to accept such Indian currency notes.    ""Though umrah is of two-week duration, my relatives are planning to return early as they have no Riyals with them. They are surviving on food provided by shopkeepers or what they get at some mosques. A few pilgrims from other countries helped my relatives,"" said Hafiz Faizan, whose relatives have gone to perform 'umrah' on November 8.    ""Most of the banks in these countries have refused to exchange such notes. A few agencies that are still accepting them are deducting as high as 30% to 40% for the service rendered. The situation is so bad that many of us are surviving only on cheap dates,"" said a Kanpur resident on phone from Saudi Arabia.    Several Kanpurites, who had gone to Riyadh recently, told TOI over phone, ""We areat the mercy of Indians living here for long. The Indians working here are unable to exchange currency and are being turned away from Saudi banks,"" Mohammad Faiz Anwar, a native of Kanpur said.    ""Even Saudi nationals in money exchange business have put up boards reading 'No Exchange of Indian Currency',"" he further informed TOI. ""A few Keralites who have big businesses here are exchanging Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes with Riyal but after deducting 40% to 50% as commission,"" he added.    Similarly, Khalid Rasheed, a native of Kanpur working at a perfumery in Dubai, informed TOI that Dubai banks have stopped exchanging Indian currency and are asking people to come after after a week. ""Officials here (Dubai) are saying that they have been asked not to exchange high denomination Indian currency notes till next orders, he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/Indians-stuck-in-Gulf-countries-after-demonetization/articleshow/55396952.cms,kanpur
2016-11-13 13:25:00,"Demonetisation to impact small firms, rural demand: Tata Steel","NEW DELHI: Government's move to demonetise currency will impact the secondary steel sector as most of the business conducted by these mini mills and rolling factories is cash-based, which in turn would help the large producers, Tata Steel said.    Counted among the top 10 steel makers globally, the Mumbai-based firm said that demonetising will also temporarily impact steel demand in rural India as the business there is also mostly cash-based.    ""We are watching secondary sector very closely because a lot of that business used to happen on cash. And maybe 60-70 per cent of the long products business is actually driven by the secondary sector.    ""So it could have a significant positive impact on the long products business for the integrated or bigger players,"" Tata Steel India and South East Asia Managing Director T V Narendran said in an investor call last week.    Government demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes from the midnight of October 8 with the aim to fight black money and corruption.    ""But in any case, market was shifting towards integrated sector because between JSW Steel, Tata Steel, RINL and JSPL and everyone else, lot more long products capacity is being added over last few years, which is encouraging the consumer segments to shift towards formal sector. But, demonetisation move should accelerate that process,"" Narendran said.    The secondary steel sector, which accounts for almost half the steel produced in India, uses sponge iron and scrap to make steel in small induction furnaces.    These producers generally procure sponge iron feedstock from nearby manufacturers and sell crude steel, mostly pencil billets and ingots, to re-rollers.    India, the world third largest steel maker, produced 89.58 million tonnes of the metal in 2015.    Tata Steel is also witnessing some impact on logistics as some movement of material got disrupted due to ""confusion at the toll gates and excise points"" which is getting ""sorted out"", Narendran said.    ""Rural demand, which is largely cash-based, will get impacted temporarily. Our dealings with our distributors are largely on RTGS and the dealings of our distributors with their dealers is largely on RTGS. Its only the final consumers who tend to pay cash,"" Narendran said.    He further said: ""So there could be some sort of hiccups there for sometime. But, I don't think, we see it as a big issue over a long period of time. We are interested to see what's happening in the real estate markets and the impact it will have there. But, otherwise, the rural markets, we think, will pick up very quickly.""",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-to-impact-small-firms-rural-demand-Tata-Steel/articleshow/55398617.cms,

Megastar Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar have lauded PM  Narendra Modi for doing away with the high denomination notes, calling it a masterstroke in India's war against corruption. When asked what he would like to say on demonetisation, Hrithik told reporters here, ""Nothing right now.""  This superstar called up Hrithik Roshan to congratulate him on ‘Kaabil’ trailerHrithik Roshan’s ‘Kaabil’ has been making waves ever since the film’s trailer was released last month.  He was speaking at the launch of a single by Ananua Birla, daughter of Kumar Mangalam Birla, yesterday. Also present at the launch were Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Prasoon Joshi, Rahul Bose, Shaina NC, Rannvijay Singha among others.    Prasoon, who was forthcoming in speaking on the currency demonetisation, said, ""When this decision was made, I am sure there was a smile on those people's face who have worked hard to earn money.    ""There will be some inconvenience for a few days but if such steps are not taken, it will become difficult to bring any change in the country. I am among those people, who have nothing to worry about because we have led a clean life. So, we should welcome this move."" Chopra also praised the government's decision, calling it a ""good step."" The new development has also caused inconvenience to the citizens in terms of cash deposit and debit.    Reacting to the criticism by other parties, Shaina said, ""It is important to understand the the Prime Minister has taken a decision which is in the interest of all. ""We do away with terrorism, fake currency. It may be inconvenient for a few days but look at the larger picture, it is inclusive for all Indians...""    While most the the film industry has given a thumbs-up to the PM for this move, actor Arshad Warsi, is among those, who are not very pleased with the development. Warsi hit out at the PM in a series of tweets, asking him to make new laws and amend the older ones that don't allow fraudulent companies to function at all and increase the number of tax payers in the country.\  Hrithik Roshan’s ‘Kaabil’ teaser out01:00Movies' first look1534Movies' first lookBollywood actor Varun Dhawan shared the first look of Bollywood film ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania,’ sequel to Humty Sharma Ki Dulhania, where he is seen kissing his co-actor Alia Bhatt.

2016-11-13 14:04:00,Axis Bank sees reduction in lending rates post demonetisation,"MUMBAI: Private sector Axis Bank expects a dip in lending rates because of the surge in deposits which lenders are experiencing in the aftermath of the government's move to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.    ""The deposits are into savings or current accounts which are low cost ones. An increase in them should bring down our cost of funds,"" Axis Bank's Head of Retail Banking Rajiv Anand told PTI.    ""The decrease in cost of funds should bring down the lending rates over a period of time,"" he added.    The comments will come as good news for the millions of harried people who have been queuing up outside banks to either deposit the scrapped notes or withdraw accepted tender for meeting their daily expenses in a predominantly cash economy.    Banks have introduced a slew of relaxations for making it easier for the customers, including extending the banking hours and keeping branches open on the weekend.    According to a report, Rs 60,000 crore was deposited into accounts till Friday evening, which will only ride up with time.    Domestic ratings agency Icra has said that it expects a 0.03-0.10 per cent dip in the cost of deposits in the near to medium term because of the surge. This reduction can be passed on to borrowers through a cut in the marginal cost of funding based lending rate.    The potential deposit opportunity is Rs 13.5 trillion, but the actual growth will not be as much as some parts will be exchanged for new notes and drawn for meeting daily needs from time to time, it said.    Despite this, the rating agency said it sees an increase of 1.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent in the total deposit base of the system.    In a surprise move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Tuesday announced that his government has decided to demonetise the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes to curb the menace of blackmoney and counterfeiting.    It introduced new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes and has given time till November 14 for usage of the older notes to pay for emergency services like hospitals.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Axis-Bank-sees-reduction-in-lending-rates-post-demonetisation/articleshow/55398966.cms,

2016-11-13 17:05:00,Demonetisation of Rs 500: Vyapam scam whistle blower pleas to swap 'seized' cash,"BHOPAL: As anger intensifies in the country with banks struggling to dispense cash following the government's quick decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination notes, whistle-blower of the infamous Vyapam scam - Prashant Pandey - is worried for nearly Rs 10 lakhs seized from his wife by police a year ago. Currencies were in Rs 500 denominations.    He has moved an application before Indore court praying for an urgent hearing on the matter so that the notes in police custody can be swapped or exchanged with new currencies.    ""They have neither proved that seized money was 'black' nor have they returned it to me. By the time they will decide over it, deadline for exchanging the notes would be over and my money would become worthless"", Pandey told TOI.    His wife Meghna was rounded up with a sum of Rs 996000 from an office near Nehru stadium at Indore in a joint operation led by state's intelligence unit and local crime branch on July 26, 2015. It was alleged to be a well-planned strike against the bond fan after he sought to topple chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.    Prashant argues that the seized money was meant to buy a house and police took a vindictive action to harass him. However, police still maintain they had specific intelligence inputs on cash being delivered to his wife through 'hawala'. Money was seized under Section 102 of CrPC (power to seize any property which creates suspicion of the Commission of any offence) after she failed to give a satisfactory explanation, said police. Meghna lives with his parents and two children in Indore while Prashant has shifted to Delhi citing threat to his life.    Police officials privy of the case say that the seized money can be handed over to him on 'supurdigi' (a legal term for giving a sub judice property in someone's custody by court). This means Prashant can keep the cash with him, but cannot swap or exchange it until case is decided.    Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced demonetization of Rs 500 and 1000 currency notes with effect from midnight, making these notes invalid in a major assault on black money, fake currency and corruption.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/Demonetisation-of-Rs-500-Vyapam-scam-whistle-blower-pleas-to-swap-seized-cash/articleshow/55400502.cms,bhopal
2016-11-14 03:44:00,"‘Demonetization is fine, but strong steps needed to fight corruption’","THANE: The demonetization of high value currency has stirred a national debate with people taking positions guided by their perceptions on politics and economics. TOI talks with Dr Avadhoot Nadkarni, retired Director of Economics, University of Mumbai, who has lauded the move, but is not entirely convinced it would eradicate corruption completely.    Q) The demonetization has taken the nation by surprise. Do you think it will achieve its target of weeding out black money and corruption?    A) The sudden withdrawal of high value currencies is definitely one step in the right direction. We must understand that the real fight is against undisclosed income which is often converted into assets like gold, real estate. It would be too early to make a comment on whether the entire bulk of black money or cash would be unearthed. By a cursory estimate nearly 50% of the unaccounted cash could be retrieved while the others could escape through the system. Corruption and hoarding could return unless you take strong steps.    Q) Does this open a window for a parallel economy and will the aam aadmi be exploited in the bargain?    A) There is a possibility of a parallel system in place that accepts the old notes in return for a commission. Few business units like restaurants or entertainment centres could end up as channels for parking the money in banks as there is no legible time frame for doing so. They can easily deposit money stating that it is from a transaction done a day before the notes were banned.    Q) So does it mean the plan does'nt net the big fishes?    A) A notable segment involved in corruption including the businessmen tend to convert their cash into commodities. A lot of time limit has been given that will be exploited by those hoarding cash to convert the stash from black to white. The real test will be to introduce measures that will make it difficult for the people to hoard money.    Q) The common man seems to be the most affected as there is inadequate change available in the market?    A) Yes, a little thought could have saved the hassles for the aam aadmi. However, the nation is supporting the move with the sole intention to have fresh start after the system is drained out of the illegal money.    Q) Will this move encourage use of plastic money and which segment will be impacted the most?    A) The use of alternate modes of payments could increase in the metros which will be beneficial for the government.    Q) How will the drive impact the elections that are scheduled early next year in Mumbai and Thane?    A) A huge segment of political leaders would possibly have been hit badly. This move will certainly impact their strategies.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/Demonetization-is-fine-but-strong-steps-needed-to-fight-corruption/articleshow/55403548.cms,thane

Card transactions at the PoS machines of a leading private bank faced problems even as more ATMs went live (at least for an hour) until cash ran out.    The total cash deposited in banks since the announcement of the withdrawal of the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has crossed Rs 1.5 lakh crore, according to estimates received from different banks. SBI received total cash deposits of Rs 75,945 crore and exchanged currency worth Rs 3,753 crore.    Against this, there had been withdrawals of Rs 7,705 crore in currency notes of Rs 100 and Rs 2,000 until Sunday.    On Sunday, banks took measures to speed up cash transportation, giving more power to officials to improve availability of currency in branches. On Monday, banks will be closed in several states on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti. Cash deposits are expected to pick up next week with utilities ceasing to accept old high-denomination currency notes from November 14.    Branches in eight states - Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, and Haryana - will be open for transactions on Monday.    Bankers said they had streamlined the queue system at their branches.    Most banks have started a token a system and separate queues for senior citizens.

Many tourists have now changed their plans due to the shortage of currency.    According to sources, while room bookings have had a few cancellations, the effect on food and beverages business as well as cabs has been severe. Restaurant owners complained that business has dropped by nearly 25% as people are facing problems with paying lower denominations to avail the services. Similarly, cab operators expressed concern due to dwindling number of visitors availing their services to visit the Agency area and also for visits within the city.    ""Tourists who have already booked and came to Araku are facing lot of problem,"" observed a trade union source working at a hotel in Araku. ""We are wondering what will happen to the future bookings,"" he said, adding that the entire area is dependent on the tourist season between October and January for business.

There is a shortage of Rs 100 notes and I don't have change to give also. We are wondering how to manage this. I don't have sufficient money and there are too much queues at banks. If I ask for Rs 10,000, then they are giving Rs 2,000 notes, which is useless. There are lots of problems in the future, if this doesn't get sorted out soon.

2016-11-14 10:53:00,Demonetisation hasty decision: Asad,"HYDERABAD: The growing displeasure among the public in Old City over the demonetisation of notes has forced public representatives to visit banks and post offices.    Women folk and senior citizens who were seen standing in serpentine queues at branches of banks were both relieved surprised to see legislators visiting banks and inquiring about transactions and requesting managers to cooperate with residents.    While the ban was announced a week ago, legislators from Old City and other older parts of the town were only now beginning to show some movement.    ""Apart from Asaduddin Owaisi, who had said demonetisation was a hasty decision, few else spoke out here. The Centre's decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has caused a lot of hardship to a massive number of honest and hardworking people. And MLAs merely inspecting banks is not enough. More is required,"" said Mohammed Younus, a resident of Old Malakpet.    On Sunday, there was a heavy turnout of public at banks compared to previous days, as a result which a few banks put up tents outside branches to provide them shelter.    Several tried to make hay even if under the cloud. Stationery shops across Old City made a quick buck by selling request forms (Rs 5 a piece) needed at banks to exchange old notes The forms of course are available for free at banks and post offices.    Police in South Zone, which covers large parts of Old City, sought to help people standing in queues for long hours by handing out water pouches. ""It is police's responsibility to serve the public in any way possible,"" said additional deputy commissioner of police (South Zone) K Babu Rao.

The operators of these gambling dens decided to close down since gamblers had stopped coming there so as to save the cash in their hands. Gambling den operators initially distributed notes of smaller denominations to their clients, but it was not enough to keep the business going.    Residents in the northern part of the city were surprised to find the gambling den near their houses not functioning. People were curious to know the reason because they had not seen any police action. They inquired from some people known to the operator of the gambling den and were told that gamblers had stopped coming there since the past few days, leading to shut down of the illegal business.    Gamblers mostly gamble with Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes which were demonetized on November 8. This has created a cash crunch and now no one is ready to give away the currency of smaller denominations that they have.    ""We were surprised to see the gambling activity stop suddenly. Earlier within a few hours of a raid by police, gambling activity would resume at the den. However, what has happened is without any police action,"" said a resident in Rander.    A gambling den has stopped functioning in Bhestan too. Some people, who were preparing to start a gambling den in Mahidharpura, have dropped the plan.

""I assure that only poor people are going to enjoy the maximum benefit with the overhaul of black money,"" Shah said while addressing the gathering in BJP's 'Parivartan' rally at DN College ground in Tirwa town of Kannauj district on Sunday.    Shah termed Samajwadi Party as a 'defunct transformer' and asked people to throw it out if they want the welfare of state (Uttar Pradesh). ""We will tell them (Samajwadi Party) how development is done. People of UP are working everywhere and till date no government had worked hard and create jobs to stop their exodus to other states. BJP is working day and night to overcome the hardships people,"" he said. Once BJP forms a government, there will be no loot of public money and no scams, he said.

The pain should be in the chests of black marketeers and hoarders not Mulayam and Mayawati,"" he asked.

2016-11-14 09:56:00,Demonetisation: It may take six weeks for ATMs to dispense new notes smoothly,"MUMBAI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has assured the nation that the entire ATM network will be back on its feet in two-three weeks to swallow the sudden demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination notes, but bankers said it will take much longer, in some cases as long as six weeks, as physical configuration of the machines to accept new notes and technological changes consume time even as workers tire.    The Reserve Bank of India hasn't said how long it will take for normalcy to return. More than four lakh trays or cassettes at the ATMs need to be replaced and software needs to be rewritten at 2,02,000 ATMs in the country, bankers said.    To fix just one ATM's technology to dispense new currencies will take anywhere between 15 minutes and 2 hours depending on the kind and age of the machine. But with just 3,000 engineers, fixing the entire system is going to be a Himalayan task.    ""Each ATM would require around 15 minutes to update, plus the travel time,"" said a spokesman at NCR, which operates nearly half the country's ATMs. ""We have put our entire staff strength of around 1,000 engineers to update the ATMs. To finish the entire work, one month would be the maximum time but we are putting all efforts to get this done at the earliest.""    While the withdrawal of high denomination notes itself has come as a bolt from the blue for bankers and ATM vendors, what has caused more pain is the central bank's decision to change the size of the new currency notes. The new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes to be circulated are smaller than the Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes being withdrawn. This means the cassettes that hold the currency notes inside the ATM machines need to be replaced.    There is no uniformity of machines. Some ATM machines not only dispense cash but also take cash. In such cases, the time taken could be as long as two hours, industry insiders said.    ""We have pressed the entire team of 1,000 engineers into service round the clock to be able to reach maximum number of ATMs at the minimum amount of time,"" said a spokesperson with AGS Transact Technologies, which runs and manages 60,000 ATMs in the country.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-It-may-take-six-weeks-for-ATMs-to-dispense-new-notes-smoothly/articleshow/55410023.cms,
2016-11-14 11:07:00,Demonetisation move puts brakes on labour migration,"BHUBANESWAR: The demonetization move has come to haunt the labour contractors in Balangir district from where lakhs of people migrate to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh to work in brick kilns.    The hiring agents usually pay the labourers in advance so that they go with them to the brick kilns. The migration starts from the fag end of October and continues till December. The labourers return from the kilns in June.    According to sources, the brick kiln owners send cash to the local labour contractors, who are mostly concentrated in the Kantabanji and Belpada areas of the district. The contractors pay advance using currencies of higher denomination in order to avoid being caught by the police. The district has many unlicensed labour agents. But the phasing out process of the higher currency notes since November 9 has hit these agents hard.    Umi Daniel, who does research on migration, said: ""Labourers who have taken the advance amount will now face problems in making ends meet as they have the old currency notes. This spart, with the final payments being delayed the migration process may take a hit. The contractors, who receive money from Andhra-based brick kiln owners through banks, will find it difficult to withdraw new currency notes in bulk"".    Around 1.5 lakh people migrate from the district every year to work in the kilns. Daniel said the labourer s families (the abled ones) normally migrate as they can lend labour leaving behind the elderly at homes. They give some money to the elderly to meet their needs until they return in June. I think the elderly, who are left alone in homes will not be able to purchase anything. This will lead to more debt and exploitation by the local money lenders, he added.    Another problem that may also haunt the labour contractor is to exchange the bulk of money they kept for disbursing among the labourers. If they go to banks with the bulk money they are likely to be seen with suspicion as most of the money are unaccounted and never come into the banking system, said another observer.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Demonetisation-move-puts-brakes-on-labour-migration/articleshow/55410818.cms,bhubaneswar
2016-11-14 11:01:00,"Soaring fiscal deficit prompts Union government to demonetise Rs 500 & 1,000 notes","The demonetisation of the 500 and 1,000 notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have hit not only the common man the hardest, but also the states governments across the country.    Telangana and West Bengal chief ministers have admitted that the demonetization move has come as a bolt from the blue for the state finances and it would be difficult for the state governments to tide over the crisis without imposing budgetary cuts on the expenditure in the last four months of the current financial year that ends on March 31, 2017.    Most economists and commentators have analysed the pros and cons of the demonetization effected in the country after a long gap of 38 years. But the factors that compelled the NDA-II regime at the Centre to go in for this drastic step in the name of curbing black money and terror financing are totally different. Faced with mounting revenue and fiscal deficits, the Union government has been merrily using the RBI for increasing the money supply to increase its borrowings. This has not only triggered inflationary pressures in the economy but also contributed to the monstrous growth of the so-called black money hoarding of high denomination currency notes. Since the beginning of the financial year 2014-15, the Union governments and the states have been facing unprecedented financial crisis, which led to actual fall in central devolutions and grants to the states despite the higher quantum of central tax transfers recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. The Union government not only phased out some central schemes but also reduced the quantum of some other central schemes and changed the pattern of funding of some more central schemes. The end-result has been that the states particularly newly-formed Telangana and the residuary Andhra Pradesh, which are suffering from the pangs of separation have been embroiled in a severe financial crisis.    Official data from the Union finance ministry and the RBI provides incontrovertible facts about the ""State of the Union government's fi nancial health."" The borrowings and other liabilities of the Union government soared by as much as 14.91lakh crores (14,91,158 crores to be exact) since April 2014. The fiscal deficit of the Union government was a whopping 5,10,817 crores in 2014-15, 5,32,351 crores in 2015-16 and 4,47,990 crores during April-September 2016 (first half of 2016-17 financial year).    The RBI data shows that the money supply in the country increased by 5,49,170 crores during April 2014October 2016. Much of the currency was released into the country by way of 500 and 1,000 currency notes. Out of the currency notes worth 12.48 lakh crores at the end of March 2014, the 500 and 1,000 denomination notes accounted for 10.50 lakh crores. By end of October 2016, the notes of these two high denominations accounted for 15.77 lakh crores. The notes of 10, 20, 50 and 100 denominations accounted for a value of 2.2 lakh crores. The 500 and 1,000 denomination notes became the most popular currency and became the common stock for hoarding. The NDA-II government, which was responsible for releasing almost 5.07 lakh crores worth currency in 500 and 1,000 denominations since it came to power, has apparently embarked on unearthing the ""black money"" that it allowed the rich and the mighty to accumulate and hoard in these two higher denominations.    So, it has launched the ""surgical strikes"" on hoarders of black money after announcing the voluntary disclosure schemes twice since coming to power. These voluntary schemes failed to evoke the expected impact and the coffers of the Union government could not be filled with any worthwhile quantum of the declared black money. The total value of the money in circulation in the country right now is 18 lakh crores and the high denomination notes of 500 and 1,000 which were demonetized are worth 15.75 lakh crores. If the general public, which is in possession of this large amount of high value demonetized notes, is unable to return the entire hoard in their possession for fear of penalties and prosecution, the government hopes to get richer through indirect ""unearthing"" of the black money .    That is to say, if the government gets back only 13 lakh crores of demonetized notes by March 31,2017, the value of the remaining currency notes not deposited with the banks would be 2.75 lakh crores. The RBI would get the nod to circulate the new currency notes of this value as well.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Soaring-fiscal-deficit-prompts-Union-government-to-demonetise-Rs-500-1000-notes/articleshow/55410765.cms,hyderabad
2016-11-14 23:12:00,Demonetisation a step in haste: Tariq,"Patna: Former Union minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) general secretary Tariq Anwar on Monday called the Centre’s decision to demonetise Rs1,000 and Rs500 notes as immature and said it had been done without making any alternative arrangement to meet the monetary crisis being faced by the common man in the country.  “There is no doubt that solid step was needed to combat the problem of black money, but it is also a fact that any major step has to be taken with considerable advance thinking. This, however, was not done, as a result of which common man has been facing immense hardship that none had anticipated,” Anwar said. The party’s state spokesman Anil Kishore Jha accompanied him.  “Apparently, no application of mind was made on making alternative arrangements, nor was there any blueprint. The step has proved to be immature and taken in haste,” he added.  “To say that the demonetisation of Rs1,000 and Rs500 notes would finally end the circulation of black money in the country is just a ‘chunawi jumla (election rhetoric)’,” Anwar said. He added that Morarji Desai as PM had also demonetised Rs1000, Rs5,000 and Rs10,000 notes, which impacted the rich and powerful, but the impact of the present demonetisation has been felt mostly by common man.  Anwar also said PM Narendra Modi has demonetised the Rs1000 and Rs500 notes for “political advantage” with eye on the assembly elections to be held next year in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. “Everything that Modi does is to gain political advantage during forthcoming assembly elections, whether it is surgical strike after Uri terror attack or any other thing. Even the demonetisation step was called surgical strike against black money,” Anwar said.  He said the NCP had not yet decided to join the delegation led by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to call on President Pranab Mukherjee, nor had NCP been extended an invitation for it. “For our sake, the NCP had initially welcomed the demonetisation step to fight against black money, but the banking system has been paralysed and common man is faced with enormous difficulties,” Anwar added.  He said plastic money is used only by five per cent of people, while bank branches have not yet covered majority of the rural population.  Anwar said the demonetisation decision would not help combat the parallel system of black money, as most of them who own it have kept it stashed in foreign banks and only a small percentage of the total black money was in circulation in the country.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Demonetisation-a-step-in-haste-Tariq/articleshow/55422181.cms,patna

While the decision has brought about a cash drought of sorts, it has also gravely affected the film industry.    One of the films that has got get affected in the process is Ajay Devgn's 'Baadshaho'. The shoot of the Milan Luthria-directed film has been postponed from November 19 to November 29. The decision to push the shoot by 10 days was arrived at since payments to junior artistes are made in cash on a daily basis and without them, the workflow is affected. Hence, the makers felt it would be wiser to start shooting when things settle down.    Confirming the news to a daily, Milan said that his production team was making arrangements for daily payments and that they would be adapting to the current situation quickly. The director also appreciated the support he received from the team including Ajay, Emraan Hashmi, Esha Gupta, Vidyut Jamwal and Ileana D'Cruz who were forthcoming in reworking dates despite last minute changes in schedule.

They stated that all banking activities in PACBs have come to a standstill due to demonetisation of Rs 500 and 1000 currencies.    According to the association, all the 4654 PACBs in the state have received oral instructions to suspend transactions after the RBI sent out a circular on demonetisation of Rs 500 and 1000 notes. Due to the order they are not able to carry out any services to the beneficiaries of PACBs.    They are not able to accept dues of various loans taken in cooperative banks by farmers or dispense cash from savings accounts of them. Interest and dividends could not be distributed to farmers. They are not able to return the jewels pledged in cooperative banks when farmers having some family functions try to redeem their jewels.    Unable to render any services or answer the queries of anxious farmers, they closed down all PACBs on Saturday and handed over the keys to cooperative registrars in concerned districts. All PACBs were closed on Monday.    ""In addition to carrying out cash transactions, PACBs also involve in distributing fertilisers to farmers and run Public Distribution Shops for poor people. All the activities have come to a standstill due to the oral order from government"", said P Kamaraj Pandian, state Joint Secretary of the association.    The employees urged government either to revoke the oral order allowing them to transact with old denomination currencies temporarily or issue new currency notes to resume operations. ""We have decided to demand the supply of cash in new denominations.

Hrithik Roshan is the latest celebrity to lend his support to the policy. The actor said, 'I salute our PM. This is radical but it's a first step to his promise of eradication of malpractices. It will also rein in counterfeiters. Bravo!!'    Of course, the 'Kaabil' actor was well aware of how the decision has caused inconvenience to the daily lives of citizens. Keeping this into account, Hrithik pointed out that this is a necessary step to curb black money and people will probably understand its benefits only in hindsight. He stated, 'Every bold and inspirational move is initially met with resistance. It's only in hindsight that people will appreciate the strength of this move against black money.'",entertainment,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/bollywood-news/Hrithik-Roshan-on-demonetisation-I-salute-our-PM-for-the-inspirational-move/articleshow/55413747.cms,
2016-11-15 08:41:00,"Demonetisation: People battle it out at banks, netas ready for war in Parliament","NEW DELHI: The political battle over scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes is set to move to Parliament with the opposition saying the measure had caused unwarranted hardship and PM Narendra Modi leading the government's response, saying he had  acted against the dishonest on behalf of the poor+  .    While Modi set the tone for the ruling party with an  aggressive speech in UP+  where he said he had his finger on the pulse of the poor and was acting on his mandate, the opposition called the demonetisation measure a ""scripted scam"" and claimed the ruling BJP had been tipped off and had secured its funds.    The  decision to replace Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes+  is expected to be debated in both Houses of Parliament this week with all opposition parties raising the issue of difficulties caused to ordinary citizens with long queues outside banks and ATMs during an all-party meeting convened by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.    The opposition said the sudden delegitimising of currency notes had led to a crisis for the poor who depended on daily wages and trade had been severely impacted. Some leaders said the move was inadequate as a lot of black money was stashed abroad and demanded better redressal of public distress. The government said it was willing to discuss measures.    The arguments provided a precursor for debates that are likely to take place in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha where the ruling side is keen on capitalising on what it sees as a bold and popular move while opposition leaders look to reduce the sheen by slamming demonetisation as a poorly thought out diversionary tactic to deflect attention from the government's failures.    Even parties such as BJD and AIADMK, which did not join the opposition deliberations hosted separately by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, said there was a need to address the difficulties faced by citizens while SP and Congress were sharp in criticising the move as poorly planned and executed. NDA allies Shiv Sena and Akali Dal backed the government at the meeting.    Congress did not raise the scam allegation at the Speaker's meeting, choosing to do so after hosting SP, TMC, JD(U), Left, RJD and YSR Congress leaders on Monday. Azad alleged that information about demonetisation had been leaked, a charge rebutted by NDA which said parties opposing the move were aligned with black marketers and hoarders.    Samajwadi Party, DMK, NCP and BSP did not take part in the deliberations at Azad's office even though SP and BSP have come out strongly against demonetisation. The opposition leaders who met on Monday are to meet again to frame a common strategy for the  winter session of Parliament+  that gets underway on Wednesday.    The political lines seem clearly drawn as BJP has lashed out at vocal opponents like Trinamool Congress, SP, BSP, Congress and Left, saying the parties needed to explain their opposition to the move to target black money. The opposition made its intent clear enough by accusing the government of acting out of political motives and delivering an unnecessary shock to the financial system.    Though the opposition is united about cornering the government over implementation of the move, its economic impact and allegations that information was leaked to the ruling party, there are differences over alignments. JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar and the CPM are decidedly cold to the idea of joining Mamata Banerjee's bid to form a loose front against the government over demonetisation.    If Parliament does discuss the issue this week itself as it is likely to, the steam would be vented and the government can look forward to transacting its business like bills relating to the rollout of GST.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-People-battle-it-out-at-banks-netas-ready-for-war-in-Parliament/articleshow/55424673.cms,
2016-11-15 03:48:00,Allow agri co-ops to handle demonetisation drive: Ryots,"Trichy: Since the ordeal of people in rural areas, particularly those from the farming community, is continuing with the ongoing process of demonetisation, farmers have appealed to the RBI to utilise the service of primary agriculture cooperative credit societies (PACCS), which are well equipped with the required infrastructure for rupee exchange.    Meanwhile, officials from the cooperative department opined that, like civic bodies, which are collecting various taxes from the public, PACCSs may also be allowed to accept loan dues from the farming community. Such a move would be of immense help for the rural folks, an official said. ""Around 3,878 PACCSs are functioning across Tamil Nadu and all of them are housed in common service centres, from where the general public get various certificates. The centres are equipped with computers with network facility, printers and scanners,"" he told TOI.    Secretary of the Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said that agriculture labourers in rural areas are finding it difficult to get sufficient 100 currency notes. ""Farmers are struggling to purchase fertilizers for paddy crops. They also find it difficult to disburse wages to agriculture labourers due to the cash crunch. Many farmers have been forced to postpone farming operations due to the situation. A similar condition prevails at branch and sub-post offices in rural areas,"" he said.    ""Societies functioning across the country can be utilised to handle the situation. Such a move would help to bring down the number of people converging at banks and ATMs in urban areas.

2016-11-15 09:05:00,"Demonetisation decision is like 'karak' chai, rich don't like it, says PM Narendra Modi","GHAZIPUR:  Recalling Jawaharlal Nehru+  , Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that he chose the nation's first prime minister's birth anniversary to deliver on his unfulfilled dreams for the development of the region despite his party's and his family's diatribes against him.    ""Leaders from your (Nehru's) party and your family are levelling allegations against me, but despite that, on your birthday, I am starting projects to fulfil your dreams for the region,"" Modi said.    Conceding that the people were facing difficulties due to demonetisation, Modi said the move was ""necessary"" in national interest.    ""My decision is a little harsh. When I was young, poor people used to ask for 'kadak chai' (strong tea), but it spoils the mood of the rich who can't bear its taste,"" Modi said.    Laying into the Congress, which has accused him of causing harassment to the people with the demonetization drive, Modi said, ""It was the Congress that imposed Emergency and turned the nation into a jail for 19 months for saving the 'gaddi' (chair) of Indira Gandhi. But I need people's support for only 50 days to nail the corrupt.""    Modi accused the Congress of misleading the country since 1962, particularly on poverty in Purvanchal (east UP), by citing a discussion from the third Lok Sabha (1962) when the then Ghazipur MP, Vishwanath Singh Gahmari, painted a grim picture of deprivation in Purvanchal before Nehru in Parliament.    ""The entire House was in tears when Gahmari told the story of how people collected grains of wheat from cow dung for food after washing. Nehru had then formed a committee headed by H N Patel which gave a report on poverty in the region, but was shelved,"" he said.    ""Uttar Pradesh has given several prime ministers to the country, and I am the ninth. The Patel committee report remained on the back-burner for many years. I have intentionally chosen November 14 to bring out the dead file,"" said Modi, adding that the dream of a bridge over the Ganga will bear fruit and bring development to the region.    Modi also recalled the brave soldiers of Ghazipur like Veer Abdul Hamid, a Param Vir Chakra awardee and inaugurated railway projects in Ghazipur.    ""Congressmen today want to know under which law I banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. You (Congress) had also banned 'chavanni' (25 paise coin). You did as per your capabilities; I did as per mine,"" he said.    Modi then asked the audience, ""Should I be afraid of such people? Should I leave the fight midway?"" The reply came: a loud 'no'.    The PM said  crores in counterfeit currency+  were being pumped into the country to fund terrorists and Maoists by ""the enemy from across the border"".

2017-01-29 06:09:00,"Vipul Amrutlal Shah: Demonetisation might affect my film, but it would be a small sacrifice for the country","Though 'Force 2' happens to be their maiden venture together, director Abhinay Deo and filmmaker Vipul Amrutlal Shah got along like a house on fire. No creative combat for these men, who worked seamlessly to bring alive their vision for the much-anticipated John Abraham-Sonakshi Sinha-starrer. Here are excerpts from an interview with Vipul and Abhinay before the release of the high-octane, action-packed sequel to 'Force', which opens in cinemas this Friday.  The car-lifting sequence has become the talking point of your film...Vipul:  Ever since John lifted the bike in 'Force', the sequence has become synonymous with the franchise. Everyone expects him to do something spectacular and big. I remember people thought the bike-lifting sequence was a cheat shot. So, John lifted the bike at an event to prove it and it became a talking point. We had to push the envelope in our quest to take the legacy ahead. We made him lift a car this time. We knew it would work, but the film is not just about lifting heavy weights. It has a bigger concept ' it's about spies and what happens to them and their families when the country disowns them.  Abhinay:  It's a big moment in the trailer, but the film is bigger and more intense than a particular scene. Having said that, the sequence defines an important aspect of the protagonist ' that he is not only righteous, but also physically solid.  Vipul, what made you cast Sonakshi, considering there is no apparent love track between her and John in the film?VS:  Abhinay didn't want to explore a typical love story. It's high time we started taking the relationship between a boy and a girl beyond the romantic angle. It is a modern and interesting take. We could have easily made it a two-hero film as there is no apparent love story, but girls are at par with boys in every aspect, so we wrote a female character. It was an unanimous decision to cast Sonakshi, because she has the personality to pull off the role of a RAW agent convincingly. Besides, everybody knows that she can do action really well.  Given the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, do you think the relevance of the subject will attract moviegoers?VS:  It's a bad way to make a film with the idea of capitalising on the political situation of a country. Had that been the case, we would have added a few sequences bashing the other country. Some subjects are too real to be judged through their commercial viability. And any situation which deals with the Army or spies shouldn't be seen through the prism of commercial success/failure. If 'Force 2' can improve the situation for even a handful of spies and their families, it will be a bigger reward than its box-office collection. The subject should reach a wider audience, as this country needs to wake up to the reality of spies and their families being ignored.  But do you think demonetisation might hamper its box-office collection?VS:  A big decision like demonetisation might affect a film, but it would be a small sacrifice on our part in the larger interest of the country ' which is to clean up black money and corruption. I have faith that we have made a good film and even if we lose out on the first day, we will be back in business eventually. We are proud of the film and demonetisation won't affect its business.  Abhinay, while working with Vipul as a producer, was there any creative interference as he is also a director?AD:  Such thoughts do crop up, but Vipul has trusted my creative vision and I trusted him with the production aspect. That's the bond we have developed over time. At times, we have worn each other's hat as well. Sometimes, the budget and the vision don't come together, which was the case with this film ' the vision was bigger than the budget. If my producer came half way and did not worry about the money, on my part, I too sacrificed my fee. It's important to share the same vision, and ours was to make a mind-blowing film. There was no scope for discord.  VS:  'Force 2' belongs to Abhinay as much as it belongs to me. No one has charged a single penny in these 18 months. Abhinay has stood by me at all times.  Abhinay, Nishikant Kamat, who directed 'Force', said he is done and dusted with the film. What pushed you to take it on?AD:  That's his opinion and I can only speak for myself. Nishikant is a friend and he did a swell job in the first film. Sometimes, you need a fresh perspective to take a film to the next level and that's exactly what I have tried to do. I have taken it from where he left and steered it into a different direction. We never get tired of a genre and there is no limiting it. A subject can be explored in multiple ways.  John is known for his tough physique and action skills. Do you think his action-hero image overshadows his acting talent?AD:  Every person has his strengths and weaknesses. As a director, I needed to play up John's strengths. We extracted the best out of each other during the course of the film. Each actor has a distinct way of emoting. Our films tend to overdramatise everything, but that is not my style. OTT (over the top) as a concept doesn't exist for me. It might be in a situation, but never in the performance. John is subtle and sticks close to reality. He suits my wavelength as I like realistic filmmaking.  Abhinay, do you aspire to enter the `300-crore club like other directors? After all, even superstars chase them...AD:  I want to be a director who is sought after by actors for the right reason, which is good cinema. It shouldn't be based on the business my last film did. If that's the case, I would question their judgement. I would like my films to make `300 crore, but these clubs don't make sense to me. I define a film's success with people gaining something from the storytelling. That's more gratifying to me, even if it's pure and simple entertainment. What mark it crosses isn't my lookout. If it makes money in the process, I would be happy for the producer and myself. I wouldn't stop myself from making a `10-crore film just because another film of mine did a `300-crore business. The business doesn't govern my talent of storytelling.  Vipul, how was it to co-produce the film with John, who is also the face of the film? Did that give him an advantage?VS:  I want my actors to work on a film with a sense of ownership. I am happy that John and I are working as co-producers because it makes the experience personal for him as well. I haven't looked at the financial aspect yet. Maybe I would do that when the numbers start rolling in. When we make films, we build relationships. You can choose to be a producer who deals with situations either clinically or with empathy. If you can maintain a good relationship with the team, success and fame will follow. But if you burn bridges with people, you will be alone on the day of the premiere.  Abhinay, 'Delhi Belly' is a cult film and one expected a sequel. Why didn't you cash in on its success?AD:  It's a film waiting to be made into a second part and I would love to do it. But I am neither driven by money and fame nor is filmmaking time bound. I take time to discover a big idea. Akshat Verma (the writer of the film) took nine years to write the first script. We have a nine-year plan, so we have another four more years to go for the sequel (laughs).  Vipul, the failure of 'Action Replayy' (2010) must have been a major setback. Do you plan to get back to direction?VS:  That was my first genuine failure as a director and it taught me a great deal. I decided to take a long break from direction to reinvent myself. I am returning to direction soon, and I know it will feel like my first film, as I will be approaching it with a fresh perspective. I am in discussion with Akshay (Kumar) for a project. I am writing the script, and will narrate to him soon.

2016-11-15 14:26:00,Some private hospitals stop taking demonetized notes,"While most private hospitals continued to accept demonetized currency notes of Rs500 and 1,000 on Monday, some hospitals said it was illegal to accept the notes any longer. Though sympathizing with patients, the hospitals said by now people should have changed old currency for new. TOI found a lot of confusion at medical colleges and private hospitals in West Nagpur.    The medical store inside Indira Gandhi Government Medical (IGGMC) was forcing patients to buy medicines from stores outside. Bandu Wankhede, a resident of Pandhrabodi, said Jagruti medical store was not accepting old notes. ""My son is badly burned. I am here from last three days. I can't leave my son to go to a bank and exchange the notes,"" he said.    Kalim Ahmed said he had returned from Uttar Pradesh on Monday and come directly to the hospital since his son developed a fever on the way.    Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences, a private hospital in Ramdaspeth, stopped accepting demonetized currency on Monday. Alka Halmare from Sadak Arjuni in Gondia district said initially the hospital refused to take the money but later relented. ""I bought medicines worth Rs1 lakh from the hospital pharmacy, but it is not accepting Rs8,000 cash in old currency,"" said Mohammad Riyaz of Jabalpur.    Dr Sameer Paltewar, MD of Meditrina, said, ""What we have been doing till now is illegal. We were accepting cash to help patients. Today, we also wrote to the I-T commissioner for clarification. We did not deny treatment to anyone for money.""    Patients at Getwell Hospital in Dhantoli also complained that the hospital and pharmacy were not accepting demonetized notes. ""It is really a big harassment,"" said Neetu Poptani from Katni, Madhya Pradesh. ""We cannot do laboratory tests too, which decide further course of treatment,"" said Anirudha Mishra.    Dr BM Rajurkar, a hospital director, said he was not aware of any such refusal on Monday. ""We would abide by government directives but private hospitals are not bound to accept these notes,"" he said.    Wockhardt Hospital at Shankar Nagar has not been accepting Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes since November 8. A patient's relative said, without giving her name, that they had sent all the cash to a Seoni bank, so they could pay it via card.    K Sujatha, centre head of Wockhardt, said the hospital was just following directives. ""We are accepting cheques and electronic transfers,"" she said.    Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS) too stopped accepting Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on Monday. But Dr Lokendra Singh, hospital director, told TOI that only OPD patients were refused these notes. ""The pharmacy is meant for indoor patients. Others can buy medicines from their cities or stores near them. We gave enough time to patients. Today we swiped cards for even Rs200-300. Till today, we cooperated as a social duty,"" he said.    Diwakar Todewar, a patient at Sushrut Hospital, Ramdaspeth, complained he was forced to pay through card. But Dr Sudhir Babhulkar said though they were a bit rigid initially, they were accepting old notes from those who didn't have new ones.    Medinova Rainbow Diagnostics is not taking demonetized notes from day one. Director Dr Raju Dhakane said, ""We have performed tests on credit too. State CM spoke of refunding hospitals Rs10,000 in case of cheque bounce, but has not given any specific directions to private hospitals,"" he said.

2016-11-15 13:37:00,"Take demonetized notes or lose change, hoteliers’ dilemma","MARGAO: In the absence of adequate cash flow resulting out of the current currency crisis, restaurant owners in the state are facing a rather piquant situation —risk losing their customers by refusing to accept the demonetized 500 and 1,000 notes or exhaust their stock of smaller denomination notes in return for change of 2,000.  ""Either way we are facing the brunt of the situation. People are now presenting 2,000 currency notes while paying their bills of much smaller amounts like 200 or 300 and expect change in notes of 100. How long can we go on like this,"" president of South Goa Hotels and Restaurant Owners' Association C P Jaggi told TOI, adding that the situation will turn to normal only after new currency notes of 500 denomination come into circulation.  What has worsened the situation, Jaggi feels, is the recent rumour that was doing the rounds that the new currency notes of 2,000 denomination would have a chip embedded in it so that they can detected by a satellite. ""People therefore are wary of keeping these notes with them in the fear of getting detected for hoarding money, and want to spend it as early as possible,"" Jaggi said.  The situation has prompted some restaurants to put up notices that demonetized currency notes of 500/1,000 will no longer be accepted. Like this case of a restaurant owner from Quepem. ""People present themselves with notes of 500 or 1,000 after having their meals. To avoid being seen as rude, we accept the notes but prefer to give credit to our regular customers,"" he told TOI stressing that the sales have gone down by more than 50%.  On the other hand, Prisco Silveira, owner of a cold storage unit at Ravanfond, Margao, said that his sales have gone up due to a feast in a nearby village. ""I will accept the demonetized notes as long as my bank accepts them from me. The feast has provided the people an opportunity to spend their demonetized notes,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Take-demonetized-notes-or-lose-change-hoteliers-dilemma/articleshow/55421915.cms,goa
2016-11-15 06:22:00,Demonetisation has little impact on realty sector,"KOLHAPUR: City-based real estate developers have claimed that demonetisation of old high-value will have very little impact on the sector and help customers find homes at cheaper rates.    The common understanding is that the real estate and bullion trade involves high amount of black money transactions. As a result, the sector will be badly affected and the property rates will reduce immediately.    However, developers claimed that the use of black money in the sector is high in larger cities, where the decision will have a huge impact.    Mahesh Yadav, president of Credai (Kolhapur), said, ""The decision has led to an increase in the currency stock of banks. Banks are now supposed to reduce interest rates, which will help customers buy flats or houses easily. At present, the temporary cash crunch has not stopped customers from buying homes.""    Ever since the decision was announced a few days ago, experts have been claiming claimed that land rates will come down suddenly, and the rates of flats and houses thereafter.    Yadav said since the ready reckoner rates are more or less equal to the market rates for Kolhapur, there will not be a major change in land prices. Moreover, it is speculated that eviction of black money from the sector will help bring the construction cost down by at least 20%. At present, the sector is facing a slowdown and the developers are unable to sell flats because of capping of prices on the higher side.    Ajit Narke, a city-based developer, said, ""People have a golden opportunity to invest in real estate in the near future. The developers based in Kolhapur get very less margin as against those in other big cities. Therefore, the chances of pricing coming down are bleak at present.""However, some developers admitted that the sector will be hit badly because of halting of cash flow and restrictions on deposits in the banks. However, institutions such as Credai are keeping a watch on the market.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/Demonetisation-has-little-impact-on-realty-sector/articleshow/55425981.cms,kolhapur

The students, from different towns and villages, are using their saved money in lower denominations to make their ends meet.    Many students are approaching petrol pumps for getting change easily. Ashish Kondra from Chandrapur said, ""I took Rs500 note to many shops but no one accepted it and I even faced problems while travelling. I had to convince the petrol pump attendant to give me Rs300 in change for further expenses. I have resorted to sharing food with my friends"".    Manjula Chandwani, MBA student from Parasia said, ""I have no money in my bank account and no one is providing change for the only Rs1000 note left with me. I do not have time to stand in queues of ATMs and banks as my college exams are fast approaching"". Working students also suffered while paying bills. Likewise, Gaurav Thakre from Hinganghat said, ""I have tried to pay my electric bills several times but the clerks did not accept the redundant currency even though they were supposed to. ""The demonetization had affected various aspects including the rationing in our pocket money"", said two school boys who did not wished to be named.    Many students shifted to online and card payments to fulfil their needs. Tejas Anjankar, NU student from Wardha, said, ""I used my debit card to pay for petrol and also for buying vegetables from super markets since I had only few Rs100 notes left with me"". Another MBA student from Chandrapur, Kartik Thakre said, ""I used the money left with me very sparingly from last three days and requested my friends to shuttle me to and fro from college"".    ""At the end of last month my father gave me cash in denominations of Rs500 and Rs1000. The queues at banks were too long so I had curb my expenses with whatever cash I had left"", said Nidhi Wairagade from Ramtek doing her post-graduation at University Campus. Some students managed expenses by borrowing money from classmates. ""I borrowed change from my friends because the hostel warden is charging Rs50 for having Rs500 note changed"", said Megha Shendre from Bhadrawati. Manmohan Jham, from Junardeo pursuing final year diploma said, ""I cannot wait at banks for hours due to my exams, so had borrowed money from friends"". Anurag Nagpurkar student of Dharampeth Science said, ""The petrol pump attendant was adamant to fill fuel worth Rs500. My vehicle could only take fuel worth Rs350 so I had filled the remaining fuel worth Rs150 in a bottle"".    Some students also faced problems while visiting doctors as they allegedly refused to accept demonetized currency notes.

""The recent turn of events is definitely going to help the bankers recover large liabilities. Defaulters can use the banned notes to repay their loan. Suppose they don't pay, the bad loans will remain with them and if they pay, they will be rid of liability and hence, they have started settling the loans.    On Friday, we made recovery in a bad account in Lucknow - the defaulter came and straight away paid us Rs 3 crore.It was all in 500s and 1000s,"" said G Sreeram, managing director and CEO of Dhanlaxmi Bank.    ""Government of India wants everything to be tracked - and here, somebody has taken the loan, repaid it and has a source to show. So we are anticipating some good recoveries to be done, especially in medium type accounts,"" Sreeram said. A senior official with the South Indian Bank, headquartered in Thrissur, also confirmed the trend.    ""Recovery of bad loans is going to happen as a result of the demonetisation, even if it is in a limited way. In Tamil Nadu, one of the defaulters who had avoided all chances of settling his debt suddenly paid the initial token amount for his bad loan of Rs 50 lakh.

""The PM said people of the country have supported the decision overwhelmingly but opposition parties want to sabotage it, which should be strongly countered,"" parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar said after a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board followed by one of NDA constituents to discuss strategy for the winter session.    I&B minister Venkaiah Naidu said Modi had made it clear that there was no question of any rollback as people had strongly supported the move. ""All NDA parties extended their support to the government's decision. We have feedback from constituencies, which suggest people have supported demonetisation overwhelmingly,"" Naidu said.    He added that the  crusade against black money and corruption+  would be taken to its logical end.    Urging NDA allies to go to the people and explain the government's war against corruption, Modi asked them not to be defensive on demonetisation as people were ready to face hardships for larger gains.

2016-11-16 06:58:00,Mamata and Left on same page against demonetisation,"NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Most of the opposition party leaders — including arch rivals Trinamool Congress and CPM — gathered at Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Ghulam Nabi Azad's chamber at Parliament on Monday afternoon to take on the Narendra Modi government over demonetisation. Their presence indicated that the ruling BJP may be outnumbered in the Rajya Sabha.    The unity show, however, weakened a little over Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee's proposal to take up the matter with President Pranab Mukherjee. Hours before the gathering at Azad's chamber, Sitaram Yechury turned down the Trinamool chief's offer to accompany her to the President. The CPM general secretary held that his party had already served notices in Parliament to suspend all business to discuss this issue. It would be meaningful to call on the President after demanding the government's explanation in Parliament in the winter session, he argued.    But Mamata is unfazed. She will be going to the central hall of Parliament on Tuesday afternoon to speak to the Opposition leaders, even if the Left stays away from the delegation to the President on November 16. As of now, National Conference and Aam Admi Party have responded to Mamata Banerjee's call.    Whatever the difference, Opposition parties like Congress, Trinamool, CPI, CPM, Nitish Kumar's JD(U), Lalu Prasad's RJD, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, YSR Congress, Mulayam Singh's SP and Mayawati's BSP are all on the same page over voicing the difficulties that the Modi government has thrust upon the common man. Leaders who later met at Congress Lok Sabha leader Mallikarjun Kharge's chamber said that they would again meet on Tuesday afternoon to take stock of the situation. Trinamool leader in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay is already in touch with the Opposition leaders. ""Some other leaders from Samajwadi Party, DMK and NCP are expected to attend the meet tomorrow,"" said Bandyopadhyay. The challenge of the Opposition is to gain the maximum numbers in the Lok Sabha when they are already in a better position in the Rajya Sabha.    Fearing that the sudden liquidity crunch would push prices of essential commodities, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee waived the agricultural tax on truckers for the next three days. Some of the state public utilities such as the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has announced that it will accept old 500- and 1000-rupee notes for paying property tax.    CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury also wanted the Modi government to allow people use old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes for some more time. ""Yesterday, the PM asked people to give him 50 days. But people are dying as they can't pay for treatment. Allow people to use the old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes at least in public utilities and for white transactions. The Kerala government has permitted it till December 21.

However, police have attributed the suicide to some family issues.    Chanda Khatun Sheikh, a resident of Bhestan Awas, went to buy grocery items from a provision store on the night of November 8 after the government announced demonetization of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations.None of the shopkeepers accepted her currency on that night. She went again the next afternoon and the result was same, putting her under lot of stress as she had Rs 7,000 in the demonetized currency, her two sons told officials from Dindoli police station.    Worried as she was, Chanda Khatun consumed an insecticide kept in her house. She fell unconscious and was rushed to New Civil Hospital (NCH) by her sons Sharafat and Saddam, who run a tyre puncture repair shop. She was shifted after Friday midnight to Lokhat Hospital where she died during treatment.    Sharafat said, ""My mother told police that she was under stress ever since provision stores refused to accept demonetized Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes from her for grocery items.

2016-11-15 13:04:00,Demonetization hits operations in lower courts across Goa,"PANAJI: The number of new cases being filed in lower courts across Goa has slowed down to a trickle as lawyers and their clients increasingly find themselves running short of currency notes of lower denominations. The impact on the functioning of the high court of Bombay at Goa will be known this week as it opens on Tuesday, after Diwali vacations.Lawyers informed that as online payment of court fees has been introduced only last month in Goa, nearly 100% of the transaction in courts in Goa still rely on cash. To file new cases, court fee is paid depending on the valuation of the case. For instance, for a case of a valuation of Rs1 lakh, a fee of Rs3,300 has to be paid.""All these work out into odd figures and notes of Rs100 are in short supply. The lawyers' fees per hearing are also in odd figures like Rs750, Rs1,500, etc. Besides, lot of photocopying and stamps are required to file cases, for which lower denomination notes are needed,"" said a Panaji-based lawyer.Lawyers said that it is especially the filing of suits of high valuation that have been affected, as some minor cases require stamps worth only Rs50.Some said that they are delaying the filing of new cases also because clients are asking them to appear on credit, stating that they will pay the lawyers' fee at a later date.The court in Mapusa, one of the most crowded court premises in Goa, is seeing a considerably smaller crowd lately.""Once the high court opens on Tuesday, it will take nearly a week before we can fully assess the impact of the demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes,"" said high court lawyer Sagar Malkarnekar.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Demonetization-hits-operations-in-lower-courts-across-state/articleshow/55428339.cms,goa

Stalin was in Madurai to garner votes for his party candidate P Saravanan, ahead of the Thiruparankunram constituency byelection to be held on November 19. S M Seenivel of the AIADMK won the constituency in the election held last May. But he died on May 25 without assuming charge as MLA.    Stalin went from shop to shop to garner votes for his candidate, a doctor by profession. Starting his campaign at 5pm in Valayankulam Perumal Temple, he spoke at the Perungudi Thevar statue, Nilayur Handloom Nagar auditorium, Harvipatti bus stop, Vilacheri Manthai ground, Thanakkankulam ground and Nagamalai Pudukottai.    ""The AIADMK government has become non-functional. People should teach them a lesson and vote them out of power. After demonetization, the chief ministers of various states have expressed their concern for the poor and middle class residents who are facing the brunt of this move. However, our chief minister has not spoken a word on this issue. The chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banarjee has been going from bank to bank to appraise the situation. This is not the case in Tamil Nadu,"" he said.    ""After a gap of 54 days, the AIADMK general secretary issued a statement reportedly with her signature urging voters of four assembly constituencies - Aravakurichi, Thanjavur, Thiruparankundram and Pudhucherry, to cast their votes for AIADMK.

""The recent turn of events is definitely going to help the bankers recover large liabilities. Defaulters can use the banned notes to repay their loan. Suppose they don't pay, the bad loans will remain with them and if they pay, they will be rid of liability and hence, they have started settling the loans.    On Friday, we made recovery in a bad account in Lucknow - the defaulter came and straight away paid us Rs 3 crore.It was all in 500s and 1000s,"" said G Sreeram, managing director and CEO of Dhanlaxmi Bank.    ""Government of India wants everything to be tracked - and here, somebody has taken the loan, repaid it and has a source to show.

The release of one Kannada movie was put off last week.    With single screens, the mainstay of Sandalwood's box office collections, reporting sparse audiences after the November 8 demonetization, the Kannada film industry is all nerves. While producers of John Jani Janardhan, which was to hit the screens on November 11, backtracked, the makers of Nataraja Service and Badmaash, slated to release this week, have decided to go ahead.    Nataraja Service distributor M Muniraju from Sri Veeranjaneya Productions said they can't keep the release on hold as the after-effects of demonetization are likely to linger till December-end. Confirming the Sharan and Mayuri Kanti-starrer will be released in 200 theatres across the state, he said they are hopeful their product is strong enough to shrug off the negativity. The movie is directed by Pavan Wadeyar.    Stating that audiences are staying away from theatres as they don't want to exhaust their limited stock of notes of smaller denomination, industry sources said film makers are planning to request the audience to turn up in groups so high denomination notes can be tendered.    ""We hope the situation will improve soon,"" NS Rajkumar, producer of Nataraja Service, said.    Sources also said the makers of Badmaash, directed by Akash Srivatsa with Dhananjaya and Sanchita Shetty in the lead roles, are also making all efforts to encourage people to go to theatres.    A veteran Sandalwood producer said, ""Unlike other language movies, which can bank on multiplex screens, Kannada movies are more dependent on single screens, especially in the district centres. Also, multiplexes have the option of online payment, which not all single screens have. Theatres have been running empty since November 8 and the situation won't be very different this week too.

2016-11-16 00:43:00,‘Make use of agri societies to handle demonetisation process’,"Trichy: Since the ordeal of people in rural areas, particularly those from the farming community, is continuing with the ongoing process of demonetisation, farmers have appealed to the RBI to utilise the service of primary agriculture cooperative credit societies (PACCS), which are well equipped with the required infrastructure for rupee exchange.    Meanwhile, officials from the cooperative department opined that, like civic bodies, which are collecting various taxes from the public, PACCSs may also be allowed to accept loan dues from the farming community. Such a move would be of immense help for the rural folks, an official said.

The centres are equipped with computers with network facility, printers and scanners,"" he told TOI.

""Farmers are struggling to purchase fertilizers for paddy crops. They also find it difficult to disburse wages to agriculture labourers due to the cash crunch. Many farmers have been forced to postpone farming operations due to the situation. A similar condition prevails at branch and sub-post offices in rural areas,"" he said.    ""Societies functioning across the country can be utilised to handle the situation. Such a move would help to bring down the number of people converging at banks and tATMs in urban areas.

2016-11-16 00:44:00,Demonetisation hits foreign exchange agencies in Pondy,"Puducherry: The demonetization of 500 and 1,000 currencies has hit the foreign exchange agencies hard in the Union territory of Puducherry. The money changers could not trade currencies due to deficiency of funds after the Union government set a withdrawal limit of 10,000 per day from banks for current account holders.    The clients of currency exchange firms mostly include local people periodically receiving money electronically from their relatives living abroad and foreign tourists visiting the former French enclave. The money changers said local people were reluctant to receive cheques as they did not want to be caught in the restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from banks. Foreign tourists, who do not have any bank account in India, cannot accept cheques too. As they do not have much options to exchange foreign currencies with Indian rupees, their stay in the coastal town is becoming a nightmare.    There are roughly 20 foreign exchanges in Puducherry and all of them reported that business had come down drastically to less than 20% in the last six days.    ""The government has set a withdrawal limit of 10,000 per day for a current account holder whereas on an average we trade 20 lakh worth foreign currencies per day. We are issuing cheques to clients, but, they are reluctant to receive them,"" said N Saravanan, manager, Centrum Direct Limited, which has more than 170 branches in the country. ""We haven't done any business ever since the demonetization of the two high value denominations,"" he said.    The foreign exchanges that used to rake in about 3 crore business every day, hardly does a few thousand rupees worth business now.    K Sezian, manager, S S Forex private limited, said, ""Foreign exchange business has hit the rock bottom. We do not have Indian currencies. Earlier we could pay up to 50,000 in cash to local people. We used to issue cheques when the value of foreign currencies crossed 50,000"".    Similarly, non-resident Indians (NRIs) and foreigners can trade Indian currencies up to $3,000. They have to receive the payments in cheques if it crosses the $3,000 slab. ""With an acute shortage of cash, we have been left with no other option but to issue cheques for even paltry sums, starting from 2,000.

2016-11-16 10:34:00,Funds tap turns dry for terror and Maoist groups after demonetisation,"NEW DELHI: Demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes by the government seems to have dealt a  body blow to funding of terror+  in Jammu & Kashmir as well as Left-wing extremist violence across several states.    While hawala cash transfers to terrorists and separatist elements based in Kashmir, which were mostly in  denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000+  , have come to an abrupt halt, Maoist groups, particularly in states like Bihar and Jharkhand, are at pains to ""convert"" the extortion money that has been stocked as piles of cash into 'legal tender', according to sources.    An intelligence officer tracking terror funding in Jammu & Kashmir said hawala channels had run dry after the the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. With no unaccounted cash to fund violence and protests in the valley, the lead trouble-makers have been forced to lie low. For, they no longer have the money to pay the local youths to pelt stones and stage violent protests.    A source said logistics for any terror operation or mob protests require money, which is almost entirely paid through hawala. ""It is therefore interesting to note that no major terror attack has been reported in the valley since November 8,"" he said.    ""Though this could be partially on account of normalcy having returned to the valley prior to demonetisation, it also indicates that terrorists are now finding it difficult to fund their activities,"" said a senior officer of the security establishment.    The officer said the lull in terror operations could be utilised by the security forces to step up counter-operations against terrorists holed up in the valley. ""First turn off the resources of terror outfits and then neutralise terrorists before they can find a way of replenishing their coffers,"" said the officer.    According to intelligence inputs, the bigger casualty in terms of sheer volume of funds, however, is Left-wing extremism. Intercepts of recent conversations among CPI(Maoist) leaders based in Bihar and Jharkhand show them discussing the fear of losing their piles of cash collected through extortion and 'levy'. Government agencies have, meanwhile, stepped up surveillance to track money flow in naxal-infested areas. There are intelligence inputs that Maoists may target banks and cash vans to make good their losses, leading the security forces to step up vigil.    It is learnt that senior Maoist leaders have contacted their trusted relatives and friends to explore possibilities of exchanging their stashed cash. Maoist undertrials have expressed helplessness in saving their cash stacked with confidants.    As per estimates of intelligence agencies and other experts, the annual money collection by Maoists may be over Rs 1,500 crore. The extortion from tendu patta contractors itself amounts to Rs 200 crore per state. Besides, 'levy' is collected from road contractors and big industrial houses carrying out mining activities in states like Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.    As many as 124 incidents of extortion/levy by Maoists have been reported so far this year, resulting in death of 17 civilians. Most of these incidents were concentrated in Bihar and Jharkhand. In a recent crackdown on Maoists on November 3, three persons were arrested and around 86.5 lakh recovered.    Maoist fronts in metros like Kolkata and Delhi have come forward to publicly oppose demonetisation, with some holding protests demanding a rollback and members of a CPI(Maoist) student wing in Delhi launching propaganda against demonetisation through social media posts.

They have put forth nine points to explain why the move is not likely to achieve the desired ends:    If high-value notes are used to ""hoard black money"", then ""issuing even higher value Rs 2,000 note is completely inexplicable,"" they say. ""Black money is generated through evasion of taxes on income from lawful activities and money generated from illegal activities."" Those who have amassed black money can convert it to bullion, real estate and foreign currency. The former RBI Governor and the current chief economist of the World Bank have spoken against demonetization. Eighty-six percent of currency in circulation and 97% of all transactions by volume are done in cash. ""Summary demonetization has created chaos"", the letter notes.    Only 30% of the Indian population has access to the banking system, as per data compiled by the finance ministry. The distribution of banks is extremely skewed, with a third of all bank branches in the Tier 1 and 2 cities - ""people in rural India who often also suffer from inadequate information have become the worst victims of demonetization."" All currency only has value because of the inherent trust in the banking system, and the summary demonetization has shaken this trust, the letter writers say, seeking clarifications on some points.    ""Rs 1.14 lakh crore of bad debts have been waived by government banks in the last three years. At the same time, loans worth lakhs of crores of rupees are still outstanding. Why has the government not made public the names of the beneficiaries of the waiver and the names of big defaulters, both individuals and corporations?"" The letter writers ask why the government announced that cash deposits of over Rs 2.5 lakh would be scrutinized and tax return with 200% penalty imposed for any tax evasion - this appears to be intended to dissuade people from depositing money so that the government can claim success of demonetization and forewarn people to split their deposits among different accounts and different depositers, the letter says.    The letter writers note that conversions can be done only after filling a form and attaching ID proof - major harassment for the poor and illiterate, many of whom have no identity card. The writers note that the cost of replacing the currency is estimated at Rs 20,000 crore. Far greater losses will be incurred in markets predominantly run on cash. Before effecting such a change, adequate new notes should have been printed; arrangements should have been made for its proper distribution, ATMs should have been recalibrated. Unplanned demonetization has caused a ""riot-like situation in the country"", the letter writers say.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Roll-back-demonetization-it-has-caused-riot-like-situation/articleshow/55445150.cms,jaipur
2016-11-16 09:16:00,Winter session of Parliament: Opposition eyes surgical strike on government over demonetisation,"NEW DELHI: The threat of a washout looms over the winter session of Parliament with Congress likely to demand that a discussion on  scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes+  be accompanied with a government explanation and an inquiry into alleged ""leak of information"" about demonetisation.    Congress apprehends that the raging row will be defused if the government accepts the adjournment notice for debate given by the Congress-led opposition and this will pave the way for business as usual. But a demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe, unlikely to be acceptable to the government, will stoke the confrontation.    On the eve of the session, the entire non-NDA camp, including SP, BSP, NCP and DMK, attended a strategy session called by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad.    Besides, Trinamool Congress of Mamata Banerjee has already declared its aggressive intent. All these parties have been seen as soft on the Centre with some distancing themselves from Congress's aggression on issues like GST in the past.    Their combined numbers and lung power give the opposition the muscle to dictate running of the two Houses.    While Congress on its own has an upper hand in Rajya Sabha, the new-found opposition unity also bodes ill for Lok Sabha which has bucked Congress's past blockade because of NDA's brute majority as well as the lead opposition player's isolation.    Ahead of the session, the prospects of the month-long session falling victim to a standoff is seen as a serious possibility though it will have to be seen if the demonetisation glue holds. Sources said the opposition camp will finalise the strategy in a meeting on Wednesday morning.    The opposition will target  demonetisation as a ""scam""+  by alleging that the policy change was leaked in advance to benefit BJP-friendly entities, even questioning the ""intent"" behind the decision.    Tainting the controversial policy, besides focussing on the ""inconvenience and harassment"" faced by common people, is seen as the best way to neutralise the moral high ground that the Centre is seeking to occupy through the policy it has dubbed as a ""surgical strike on black money"".

2016-11-16 08:12:00,Demonetisation leaves Telangana in squeeze,"HYDERABAD: A whopping Rs 68,000 crore cash has gone out of circulation in Telangana, courtesy demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes announced by PM Narendra Modi on November 8.    The state normally enjoys a total cash circulation of Rs 80,000 crore a month from which it usually earns Rs 4,200 crore as tax revenue. However, according to a government estimate, 85 per cent of the Rs 80,000 crore cash had gone out of circulation from November 9 making the state government poorer overnight.    The withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has pushed the state's finances into doldrums as entire economic activity came to a grinding halt. The finance department on Tuesday submitted a comprehensive report to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in which it narrated the colossal damage the demonetisation has caused to Telangana's economy. ""Normally, the state earns Rs 4,200 crore in tax and non-tax earnings from its own revenue resources. But with the demonetisation, there has been a total shutdown of activity. Worst affected was the stamps and registrations department which reported a 70 per cent drop in revenue followed by liquor sale which was down by 50 per cent.    The commercial taxes collections came down by 25 to 30 per cent. All put together the state has lost over Rs 1,000 crore in November alone,"" said the report. The finance department sees no major change in the situation for next two months as the Reserve Bank of India already announced a 50-day schedule for complete changeover to the new currency. The department pointed that the pain caused by demonetisation will continue to haunt the state for next two to three months.    KCR directed the finance department to stop all payments and impose treasury controls so that whatever money received by the government would be used for the salary and pension bill for November. ""Clearing the salary and pension bill of `2,250 crore will be no problem as we are expecting Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,200 crore in revenue,"" said a senior official in the finance department. The state government is optimistic about revival of the economy once the cash comes back to circulation. ""This is like a hockey stick growth cycle where there is a steep fall followed by sudden reversal,"" explained finance department officials.    Cabinet secretary Pradeep Kumar Sinha held a video conference meeting with state finance department officials on Tuesday and appreciated the steps taken by the state government to speed up the cash exchange.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Demonetisation-leaves-Telangana-in-squeeze/articleshow/55448205.cms,hyderabad
2016-11-16 07:16:00,'Will propagate benefits of demonetisation move',"Puducherry: Former Rajya Sabha MP P Kannan, who joined AIADMK in February, hailed PM Narendra Modi for withdrawing 500 and 1,000 notes in an effort to curb corruption and black money. ""It is a bold and historic move. I render all-out support to the Prime Minister,"" he said.    He urged Modi not to revoke the decision at any cost. ""He (Modi) must not revert the decision. I will even go for propagating the benefits of the move among the general public. I don't want to politicise the issue,"" he said    He said though people are suffering because of the sudden decision to withdraw 500 and 1,000, ""I am totally confident that the people will support when they start reaping the benefits of the bold step and people will be grateful to him in the coming days,"" he said.    However Puducherry Pradesh Congress committee (PPCC) came down heavily on the Modi government for demonetisation move. In a memorandum submitted to the Puducherry chief secretary, PPCC unanimously expressed its anguish to the 'faulty and hasty decision' to demonetise the denominations of 500 and 1,000 with effect of midnight of November 8.    ""It has crated great panic and anarchic situation in the society at large and the victim of such policy is the Aam Aadmi of the great nation,"" the members said in the memorandum while arguing that the decision without proper planning to meet the exigencies exposed the weakness of central government to solve common man's sufferings since November 8.    Terming the demonetisation as a 'cover up' political stunt to conceal its inability to bring forth the black money stashed in foreign banks and distribute them among the Indian citizens as promised by Modi ahead of polls, they said the decision had caused immense hardship to the common man in purchasing daily rations, groceries, vegetables and other essential commodities. They said the move adversely affected the trade and commerce and small vendours and restaurants. ""It had resulted in huge loss to an extent of more than 5 crore per day in Puducherry,"" they said.    ""We therefore urge the Central government to take immediate steps for the distribution of enough currency notes of 500, 100, 50, 20 and 5 through the banks and give relief to the common man and the public at large without further delay,"" the members said in the memorandum.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/Will-propagate-benefits-of-demonetisation-move/articleshow/55447775.cms,puducherry

2016-11-16 09:01:00,Demonetisation hits Shilp Bazaar,"VARANASI: The visitors at Gandhi Shilp Bazaar lamented the unprecedented lull this year. The demonetisation has had an adverse impact on all the artisans participating in the fair, said Ajmal Khan, who had come all the way from Saharanpur to exhibit an array of wooden furniture. The otherwise abuzz Urban Haat that witnesses one of the biggest shopping extravaganza, Gandhi Shilp Bazaar, did not see much footfall of buyers or art lovers on day four of the ongoing fair. The participants had a hard time finding serious buyers while some even suffered losses owing to lack of notes of lower denominations.The low turnout of buyers is because of the recent demonetization move by government which has the people and the shoppers in a fix. Many said the sales had dipped to about 50%-80% as compared to last year. ""I had boarded the train for Varanasi when the news of demonetization broke out. I could not go back as all the arrangements had been made and the goods were on way. We have hardly managed to earn Rs 2,000-3,000 which is disappointing,"" Khan said.Kailash Kumar, a manufacturer of Haryanavi Zari Jutti (sandals) said that the sales had plummeted by 50%. But sales picked up on Monday when people thronged the bazaar and were apprised that invalid notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 are being accepted, he said.For first timer Sonam Kothari, seller of Gota Patti kurtas and cotton Kurtis, the fair was nothing like she had imagined. ""I had heard so much about the fair but the response we are getting is simply not the kind we expected. We are compromising a lot on prices for people to pay and things are sold,""she said.Dry fruit merchant from Jammu and Kashmir, Rehan Ahmed said the sale was negligible and that they had difficulties purchasing food items owing to demonetization. ""I had to take loan to buy meals for the day and on top of it all, there are no sales at all. I am afraid for the losses we would suffer if the sale doesn't pick up in a few days,"" he said.Meanwhile, TOI came across a couple of shoppers who were in a dilemma while purchasing less expensive products due to unavailability of change or notes of lower denominations. ""I have to make unnecessary purchases because none of us have change,"" student Shakshi Agrawal said.Housewife Ruhi Dewan said that she was not able to buy bangles at a stall. ""The bangles were priced at Rs 60 but the shopkeeper didn't have change.""Teachers Smita and Neelam said that they had to limit their purchasing to Rs 200 each as that's what they had as change. Vendors at eatery stalls too suffered losses as people refrained from thronging their stalls owing to lack of lower denomination notes. Only a few visitors ate golgappas otherwise most simply overlooked the stall as they did not have change,"" vendor Vijay Kumar said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/Demonetisation-hits-Shilp-Bazaar/articleshow/55448973.cms,varanasi
2016-11-16 09:44:00,Demonetisation: Embassies go on a mission to find cash,"NEW DELHI: The dean of diplomatic corps, who represents foreign envoys in India, has sought the external affairs ministry’s help in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s currency recall drive as many diplomats are running short of cash and diplomatic missions are besieged with calls from frantic tourists and delegates visiting the country.  Hans Dannenberg Castellanos, ambassador of the Dominican Republic, who holds the rotating post of the dean at present, has submitted a letter to the ministry seeking help for the diplomatic missions, people aware of the matter told ET.    Many diplomats are bearing the brunt of cash scarcity, they said, even as embassies in the capital have in principle hailed the Modi government’s move aimed at weeding out black money. A senior diplomat of a European nation, for example, was seen amid the panic rush at a bank trying to arrange cash for an event.    Similarly, many delegates from about 140 nations who had arrived in Delhi to attend the climate change event COP7 were left holding old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes after they had exchanged their currencies just ahead of the recall.    These delegates turned to their respective embassies in despair, said a senior diplomat who did not wish to be identified. Embassies which receive visa fees in hard currency and not demand drafts and cheques are also facing problems, the diplomat said.    Foreign tourists said they faced a particularly trying time since several money changers had also run out of local currency. “The situation, without any Indian money at all, is very difficult. We can only use credit cards and debit cards,” said a tourist from a European nation, who did not wish to be identified.    While, one of India’s old allies hailed the PM’s move and said that its diplomats had no complaints, China said banning notes was not the way to fight the menace of black money. “Modi means well and his decision was made based on the reality in India, since most illegal business in the underground economy is cash-only, and Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes constitute over 80% of all cash circulation in India. Nevertheless, we can hardly count on the new rule to fully root out corruption...    New Delhi might need to look for ideas from Beijing,” according to the article titled ‘Beijing offers clues for Modi’s new anti-corruption moves’ in state-run The Global Times.  Also read: PM raises issue of state funding of election and transparency in poll fundsAlso read: Opposition to raise issue of selective leak about monetisation  Meanwhile, officials from the central banks of Nepal and Bhutan, both of which hold significant amounts of Indian rupees, are in touch with their counterparts in the Reserve Bank of India to get more details on how to tackle the circulation of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that were suddenly rendered worthless.    Nepal and Bhutan are the only two countries which allow Indian travellers to carry up to Rs 25,000 in paper currency. Beginning last year, the RBI allowed Indians to carry this amount in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as well, which has resulted in a large amount of these notes entering and being circulated through the two countries.    Indian rupees account for 30% of Bhutan’s international exchange reserves, amounting to about Rs 2,700 crore. Nepal has banned all financial transactions in Indian rupees since Modi’s announcement of currency recall.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Embassies-go-on-a-mission-to-find-cash/articleshow/55449616.cms,

2016-11-16 13:11:00,Tirupur garment industry tides over demonetisation crisis,"COIMBATORE: With more than 60% of workers' wages being transferred into their accounts directly and raw material purchases being done mostly through cheque payments and credit, the garment industry in Tirupur has managed to tide over the demonetisation blues. While garment units paid migrant workers without bank accounts in the old currency last week, companies have stepped up their efforts to help workers open bank accounts. ""This (demonetisation) is a temporary hassle. We can't do much hide-and-seek (unaccounted) operations in exports,"" said Raja M Shanmugham, president, Tirupur Exporters' Association. ""Only 2-3% of the total business transactions are made in cash. Most of our vendors are fixed for the entire year. So, there is nothing much in terms of cash that we have to deal with,"" said T R Sivaram, managing director, Classic Polo. ""Operations have not been affected. Wherever we have to deal with cash, we are either converting it into credit or issuing old notes,"" he said.There are about 4lakh workers employed by the garment industry in Tirupur. An average garment unit pays around Rs30lakh in wages every week. Some units postponed their weekly payments from last Saturday to Wednesday due to the demonetisation drive. The initial weeks after Diwali are typically a lean period for employment of workers in garment units. Migrant labourers take more than 10days to return to work after the festival. While business remains unaffected, some native labourers are complaining as they are struggling to exchange old notes for new currency notes. State vice-president of Centre of Indian trade Union (CITU), Tamil Nadu, M Chandran, said, ""Many companies are paying salary only in old currencies. Labourers are finding it tough to exchange cash. Some of them have paid salaries for three-four months in advance.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/Tirupur-garment-industry-tides-over-demonetisation-crisis/articleshow/55452910.cms,coimbatore

For more than 200 days, this man has not spent a single penny in cash but has transacted everything digitally from tea in a roadside shop to shopping in malls. Meet Abhishant Pant, a Mumbai-based 35-year-old fintech professional, obsessed with apps but determined to see a cash-free society.    “We must educate people. This is the key to turn our society cash free. It yields in long-term results” he told ET. “It took me three months to convince my domestic help to receive direct credit into her bank account, but now she thanks me as it has helped her in building a savings habit.”    Pant has a whole host of apps that he uses to pay during transit, at grocery shops/restaurants/street food stalls. The motive is uniform: “Living without cash”. A cashless/cashfree is seen as a key to Prime Minister’s vision of black money-free India.    On a vacation a few months ago, Pant shocked a local tea seller at Mahjod village in Uttarakhand when he had offered to pay Rs 20 digitally for tea. The hesitant vendor objected, but was finally convinced when he received the sum through a mobile recharge after download. In remote areas there is no internet. Hence, Pant uses a mechanism called USSD, an unstructured supplementary service data-based mobile money provided by telecom players such as Vodafone. This mechanism is a proxy for such payments.    While the government of Sweden has invited him to share his experience, he has lectured at top management schools, including NUS Singapore , IIM-Bangalore, given Tedx talks (video created from a presentation) on cashless society.

2017-01-27 16:40:00,Malayalam film shoots stalled due to demonetisation,"Like in every other field, the demonetisation drive has affected the film industry as well, but more at the ground level. On the sets of films which have already started shoot, the crew are finding it difficult to manage daily expenses, to the extent that some films have put off the shoot.  Serving food on the set has become the biggest problem  A film set has around 75-100 crew members, and they have to be served food, come what may, say the crew. And for that, nothing but cash works.    'Out of the daily expense of ` 3-3.5 lakh on an average at a film set, one lakh is needed in cash. And food is the major expense in that,' says Dickson, a production controller. Dickson is working on Dulquer's Bejoy Nambiar film Solo currently, and it has around 60 junior artistes as well. 'Already we have 90 people on the set and with the junior artistes we have 150 people. To serve food for 150 people daily by paying cash in the current situation is getting impossible,' he says.    The film's production team employs caterers on a contract basis for the food, and is trying to transfer money into the accounts of the caterers. 'But they buy vegetables, fish and meat from street markets, not from supermarkets. And they can't pay shopkeepers in anything other than cash,' Dickson says.    Eldho, production controller, agrees. 'The food expenses itself come to ` 25-35,000 daily on a set. Even if you know the caterer, you have to give ` 10,000 as a mess deposit, in cash. He can't buy vegetables with a cheque.' While shooting in cities in Kerala and other areas familiar to them, shopkeepers and caterers are willing to opt for later payments but not so when you are shooting in rural areas or outside Kerala, Eldho adds.  Art properties require cash  When you have to buy something as small as a bit of cloth from a roadside shop, nothing but cash works, says Vijay Babu, actor and producer. 'These are for one-time use and you don't spend too much on them, and mostly buy them from roadside shops. Also, for locations, we pick out a house or a shop and pay them ` 2000-2500 as daily rent. Daily expenses are a real issue.'    The shoot of a grand sequence of Dileep's Kammarasambhavam has been postponed for this reason, says Dickson. 'The set needed something on the lines of the Second World War. We are unable to manage the properties.'    The junior artistes also need to be paid between `750 and 2000 daily in cash, which is becoming difficult, Dickson adds. 'We are trying to transfer the entire money to one person's account now.'    Paying for diesel is another problem the crew faces, especially those which are travelling around.  Films in remote locations worst hit  Vineeth Sreenivasan starrer Aby is being shot in Gundlupet, a small town in Karnataka. And it's out of the question to think of withdrawing money from ATMs there, says the crew. 'There are long queues outside every ATM in the area. Finally we travelled 60 km to Mysore to visit an SBI bank, but were told that we can have only 6k in cash, as the bank was out of money,' says Anil, production controller. 'Six thousand rupees doesn't get you anywhere. Besides the daily food, we need cash for art properties. Few shops in Gudlupet accept cards. There is no way we can stop the shoot now or come back to Gundlupet at a later date,' he adds.  Small films affected most  While the bigger films are able to hold off the payments, small films don't have the luxury. 'When it is a Dulquer film with a known producer, people will be willing to money transfer to accounts or accept cheques. But not so for smaller films. You can't blame caterers either, as they don't even know if the films will get completed,' says Dickson.    While Eldho feels it is nothing short of an emergency, Vijay Babu is of the opinion that the changes will only bring about a positive transformation in the industry, eventually. 'Till Christmas, the problems will persist. Films are already getting postponed and many releases might get clubbed at a later date. But all this is for the good, when you look at the larger picture. New terms and conditions will evolve. All industries need correction. And there will definitely be a lot of positive reformation in the film industry,' he says.",entertainment,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Malayalam-film-shoots-stalled-due-to-demonetisation/articleshow/55455516.cms,

While Eldho feels it is nothing short of an emergency, Vijay Babu is of the opinion that the changes will only bring about a positive transformation in the industry, eventually. ""Till Christmas, the problems will persist. Films are already getting postponed and many releases might get clubbed at a later date.

2016-11-17 00:00:00,Demonetization bell rings louder than band and baaja in baraats,"While pre-wedding preparations can give sleepless nights to the bride and groom, their families also go through this roller-coaster ride of emotions. It's a different story now with the recent demonetization situation. From exchanging old currencies for new and long queues outside banks and ATM machines is what giving many of us sleepless nights and body aches, all thanks to standing in serpentine queues. ""Weddings are all about fun and upbeat mood. Sadly for me, it's all about standing in queues in front of the bank. That's the dominant wedding memory I will have, it seems,"" says Mahesh Satdev, a software professional who's tying the knot very soon.  Not keeping tabs; a severe issue  As if the announcement of old currency being scrapped wasn't a big blow, shortage of cash is certainly a grave issue for the common man. When it comes to marriage there are many last minute expenses which are mostly met through cash transactions. Mahesh says, ""Last minute wedding expenses are always done by cash. Not everyone accepts payments through cheque, cards or net banking. A tab must be kept on cash withdrawal from ATM machines as one can get cash through use of multiple cards. The withdrawal limit hardly meets the need and many ATM machines are out of service too.""  Dip in ceremonies and events  Catering services are vital to any wedding and it has been hit badly by demonetization. Inder Balani, a well-known city based caterer says, ""Overall there's a 25% - 30% dip in the spending patterns. For instance, if someone is opting for a package where it is ` 1500 per plate, they are now opting for ` 800 per plate packages. And the number of functions has gone down tremendously. While we accept payments though cheque and netbanking systems, we have to keep some spare cash for attending last minute needs and for paying the labourers. This is where we face the brunt of the new system. We have asked our contractors and labourers to open a bank account so that we can make their payments through cheques.""    Zakir Hussain, a city based hotelier adds, ""Although no wedding events have been cancelled yet, but the number of items on the wedding lunch/dinner menu has gone down."" Vivek Sultania, city based florist shares, ""Our clients pay us through cheques, so there are no delayed payments. But many of us deal directly with small time vendors who provide us flowers straight from the market. These vendors have no bank accounts and need cash payment. So mid-level and small-level vendors face the maximum brunt.""  Balancing it out  While making full payments in cash is not really feasible, payments are done through cheques and netbanking only. While clients can pay through cheques, the main issue is paying small time labourers, vendors and contractors. City based wedding planner Rajesh Ravani shares, ""It's a tough situation. The good point is that there are no cancellation of weddings. Secondly, people are ready to give you services and props on credit, depending upon your credibility. Also with the kind of withdrawal limits from the bank, we are able to make payments where only cash is accepted. Whenever it's feasible, we try to make do with old currency. Most of our contractors have bank accounts so there's no problems there.""  No cancellations, though  In the midst of all this chaos, it seems that couples are all ready to take 'I do' plunge. Even as India reels under the impact of demonetization, the queries are still pouring in, suggests Gayatri Hurra, marketing communications manager, with a city based hotel. ""It is true that the wedding market is feeling the pinch of demonetization situation, but there are no    cancellations of the events scheduled for the coming months. People are also enquiring about the availability of banquets; mostly payments or token payments are done through cheque or netbanking, hence this is a saving grace.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Wedding-market-hit-by-cash-crunch/articleshow/55457579.cms,ahmedabad
2016-11-17 00:02:00,Demonetisation may lead to rise in wheat price,"Kanpur: The demonetisation, which has also effected the farming practices, may result in a hike in wheat prices in future.    Farmers are unable to purchase seeds, necessary fertilizers and other important things in absence of lower denomination currency notes, delaying the sowing of wheat crop. And the delay may bring a rise in wheat rates ultimately increasing the prices of various food items.    In north India the best time to sow wheat crop is from November 1 to 10 and if it is delayed till December 10 then both the quality and yield get affected. ""This is the perfect time to sow seeds for wheat crop to yield the best quality but as we have no money in lower denomination currency notes it would be delayed. The delay will result in bad quality and low yield,"" said farmer Dhram Singh, a resident of Gagan Kheda village, Sarsaul, Kanpur.    ""Though one can sow wheat crop till December 15 but the prime time is between November 1 and November 20. The productivity in such land where seeds will be sown late will degrade. On every one acre of land there would be a loss of five to seven quintals of the crop,' he added.    Another elderly farmer of the same village, Surendra Singh Yadav said, ""We dont have new currency notes to buy seeds and fertilizers to sow wheat crop. We are getting only old currency notes from wholesalers by selling seasonal vegetables With the limit of only Rs 4,000 to exchange at a time and now indelible ink, how will we exchange big amount which is required when ATMs too are dispensing only Rs. 2000 that too after struggling for entire day.""    Agriculture experts have also claimed that demonetization will certainly affect the agriculture cycle which is totally depended on perfect timing of sowing crops.    Dr Karam Hussian from Agronomy department of Chandra Shekhar Azad Univeristy of agriculture and technology said at present there is a decline in the purchase of seeds from the seed store of university. From a sale of three lakh rupees per day of seeds, it has come down to around one lakh. Also If wheat is sown in December month, there would be a decline of 10 to 12 quintal of crop per acres, he added.    He also advised farmers to increase the quantity of seeds for sowing and do proper irrigation if they sow seeds in December. ""But this finally will hike the price of the wheat,"" he added further.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/Demonetisation-may-lead-to-rise-in-wheat-price/articleshow/55464645.cms,kanpur

2016-11-17 00:44:00,"Demonetization fuels high petrol, diesel sales; up 60%","THANE: Petrol and diesel sales recorded a rise of over 60% in the last week as motorists queued up at the fuel stations to tank up their vehicles in the wake of the frenzy triggered by the limited validity of the high value currency.    Vehicle owners faced with the shortage of change and the free passage at the toll gates appear to have ditched public transport or the auto rickshaws and instead choose to drive in their own cars or ride on the bikes.    The easy and a better option to standing in the long queue outside the banks was to exhaust the old currency at the petrol pumps, which fuelled the sales to soar higher, most locals said.    ""Prior to the PMs announcement, the average weekly sale of petrol at my outlet was around Rs 90,000. However, people suddenly rushed to tank up their vehicles resulting in sales soaring to over Rs 1.50 lakhs since last Tuesday. The overall sale of the petrol pump was more during the initial three days of the ban,"" said Tarachand Savla, manager of a petrol pump at Majiwada.    As the demand increased, the dealers ensured smooth supply so as to avoid any trouble.    In fact, the frequency of the tankers supplying petrol and diesal too increased with the heavy vehicles making two trips a day to the petrol outlets across the city.    ""Usually in a day we would get 20,000 to 25,000 liters of fuel, but in the initial three days i.e from Tuesday to Thursday the demand was so much that we had to get around 40,000 to 45,000 liters of fuel. Also during these past few days our sale has increased by around 25% and most of the transactions are done in cash and only few are using card for making payments,"" said M K Ramdas, manager of Kapurbawadi petrol pump.    The outlet owners claimed many customers just came to get change against their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. As a result, the petrol pumps are facing a problem of returning change. At few petrol pumps the customers are asked to wait for at least 15 minutes till the time the staff gets exact change to return. Some pumps were even giving cash memos and were asking motorists to come and collect the change later, but that was eventually stopped as it was creating a chaos at the petrol pumps, stated the owners.    It was also seen that the queues at fuel stations declined when the queues at banks increased.    ""The crowd reduced on the day the banks started. The number was high on the initial three days, as people wanted to get rid of the Rs 500 and 1000 notes and petrol pumps were an easier option. The number of motorist declined from Friday and it went up a little on Monday, when the banks were shut. Now many are coming with Rs 2,000 notes and fill petrol of maximum Rs 500 or so and ask for change, which is difficult to give,"" said Raju Mundra owner of Radhakishan Lalchand petrol pump at Naupada.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/Demonetization-fuels-high-petrol-diesel-sales-up-60/articleshow/55461593.cms,thane

The collection this November has gone up by 10 percent compared to last November, said officials.

The stepped-up pace of recalibrating the ATMs may pave the way for the government to raise the limits on cash withdrawal in the coming weeks as concerns of banks being flooded with withdrawals recedes.    The government has taken several measures to ease the supply of cash and ensure the waiting time for customers at bank branches are reduced. Idle ATM's have added to the woes of people who have thronged bank branches.

While domestic air bookings were hit soon after the move was announced last Tuesday, now even international ticketing is seeing a decline.    Bharath Mahadevan, India head of Scoot, Singapore Airlines' (SIA) low cost airline which flies from the island nation to Jaipur, Amritsar and Chennai in India, said the airline used to have 500 sector bookings a day which have fallen 10% after last Tuesday.    SIA's other budget airline Tiger has also seen the 1,000-odd sector bookings a day from India fall by 10%. ""We were looking at promotional fares from February due to low season then. But because of the dip in travel demand caused by demonetisation, we may start the offers from December to entice demand from Jaipur, Amritsar to Singapore,"" Mahadevan said.    Travel portal Yatra president Sharat Dhall said: ""Announcement of sale by airlines like Jet Airways and IndiGo in peak travel season comes as a pleasant surprise to Indian travellers. Airlines have reported a short term drop in ticket sales post the demonetisation announced by the government last week, and this could be an attempt to catalyse demand and bring travellers back to the market. We anticipate that the other carriers are likely to also follow suit.""    The sales may have helped stimulate the market.    Expedia India marketing head Manmeet Ahuwalia said: ""This announcement is timed very well for travelers who are planning to kick start their new year in a novel location.

People have been queuing up for hours at banks to get their currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination exchanged or deposit. But the eunuch community that is settled in Baranpura and collects around Rs 7.5 lakh every month in cash has no reasons to panic.    The eunuchs had been planning to build a temple of Bahucharaji deity since past few years in Wadi. The construction started more than a year ago and it ended a few months back. Coincidentally, the community members paid cash to the contractor who built the temple a few days before currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 were invalidated. The community had also organized an inauguration function of the temple on November 14 that was attended by deputy chief minister Nitin Patel.

She added that they had been preparing for the function since two months and had made advance payments to all suppliers. Therefore, they do not have enough cash in the form of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination.    After demonetization, the eunuchs have decreased their visits to give their blessings.

2016-11-17 08:16:00,Fisherfolk caught in demonetisation net,"VISAKHAPATNAM: One week after the demonetisation drive was launched, fish prices have nosedived by nearly 60 per cent at various landing centres of the district.    According to sources, more than 90 per cent of the motorised boats in the fishing harbour have been anchored due to the low rates prevailing for fish and also due to the difficulties being faced in procuring fuel for the boats. At the same time, sources said fisherwomen who are mainly involved in door-to-door sale of fish in the district are bearing the brunt of demonetisation as they are unable to get their hands on lower denominations for a smooth trade. More than 13,000 fisherfolk have been affected due to the lack of lower denominations in the district, the sources said.    While king fish normally sold at around Rs 600 per kilo, it now sells for Rs 200-250 per kilo, while the price of seer fish has dropped from Rs 350 per kilo to Rs 150-200. Also, rates of croaker fish, ribbon fish and goat fish have dropped from the normal rates of Rs 60-70 per kilo to Rs 35-40.    Speaking to TOI, District Fishermen's Youth Welfare Association executive secretary Arjilli Dasu said, ""The main demand is for Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes and there is lack of these notes at the fish landing areas in the district. Many fisherwomen were able to exchange the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, but in turn they got only Rs 2,000 notes which are useless as of now for the trade.""    Furthermore, he said, ""On normal days, you have around 10-15 tonnes landing at the fishing harbour, but now only 5-6 tonnes is coming in. Due to the low loads the prices should actually have been higher, but as there is no lower denominations, nobody is buying. Even dry fish rates have dropped from the normal Rs 50-60 per kilo to Rs 30-35 per kg.""    Concurring that lack of lower denominations was hurting the fishing industry which usually witnesses a turnover of around Rs 4 crore per day in the district, Visakha Dolphin Boat Owners Association president Ch Satyanarayana Murthy said, ""Nobody has lower denominations in the market. Whatever fish is coming in is not being sold and even if the fisherfolk are able to sell it, they are getting very low rates. The unsold fish are being dried. Boat owners are also facing huge problems because of restrictions on cash withdrawals. While the literate people can use RTGS for money transfer to fuel the boats, the others are not able to do it. More than 90 per cent of the boats are in the jetty because nobody has the required money to go to the sea.""    He said, ""We need Rs 50 and Rs 100 denominations for trade to normalise in the fishing harbour. Without this, even the vendors and rickshaw pullers are not able to do business normally.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Fisherfolk-caught-in-demonetisation-net/articleshow/55464084.cms,visakhapatnam
2016-11-17 04:04:00,"It's like labour pain, a big joy on way for nation, government on demonetisation","NEW DELHI: The government put a strong defence of its decision on demonetisation on Wednesday, claiming PM Narendra Modi has delivered on his mandate to curb corruption and that the courageous move is a befitting response to criticism that it works for big business.    Responding to the opposition's charge that common people had been hit by demonetisation, information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu said the ordinary folk had backed the move while black money hoarders don't deserve any sympathy. ""Unfortunately some voices are being raised in favour of them (black money),"" he said.    Comparing the implementation of the demonetisation decision with labour pain, Naidu said, ""A mother undergoes huge labour pain while giving birth to a child. But when she hears the child of the newborn, she feels the greatest joy."" The comparison suggested the returns for the move will more than justify the current discomfort of the people.    Earlier batting for the government, minister of state for power Piyush Goyal said the country is welcoming this decision. ""When the Prime Minister was elected, he was elected on a mandate to curb corruption and black money. For the first time, the honest have been honoured and the dishonest have been troubled. There is no obstruction on the money earned by honest means. This is no curb on anyone's honest income. This move attacks those who have illicit cash,"" Goyal told the upper House.    The government speakers stood their ground against the opposition that alleged the Centre had put the common people to great hardships by arguing that despite the discomfort the citizens were supporting Modi's decision. They made the political point that Modi had gone much beyond his predecessors in launching an all-out war against corruption that seriously hurt those harbouring illegal wealth.    Naidu said the government is concerned about the pain that people are going through and the Prime Minister is holding daily review meetings to improve matters.    He termed ""absurd"" allegations that information about the move was leaked before November 8. ""In this country, elections keep happening. So, the argument that the decision was taken with elections in mind is not valid,"" Naidu said.    The minister asked Congress to make it clear whether the party was with black money hoarders, or for cleaning up the system. Claiming the move as another aspect of Swachh Bharat (clean money), he said, ""If your money is valid, it won't become invalid.""    Goyal said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ran the monetary policy, and the decision was taken after consultation with the central bank.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Its-like-labour-pain-a-big-joy-on-way-for-nation-government-on-demonetisation/articleshow/55466398.cms,

Members of Congress, Left, BSP, JD(U) and SP, while not demanding a rollback Banks cut deposit, loan rates as liquidity rises, P 21 like Trinamool leader Mamata Banerjee, lashed out at the government on the first day of the winter session. Claiming that information about scrapping of high denomination notes was ""leaked"", they demanded the constitution of a joint parliamentary committee to examine the alleged breach of secrecy .    Opening the opposition attack, Congress's Anand Sharma said housewives queueing up at banks and ATMs could not be seen as holders of black money and criticised the government for seeking to tar all critics of demonetisation as ""anti-national"". He claimed BJP had been reduced to parroting PM Modi's lines.    BSP chief Mayawati said the government was attacking opposition parties in order to hide its own failures.She said her party was a movement that collected funds from common people and not from millionaires or overseas patrons. SP's Ram Gopal Yadav warned that BJP would face the wrath of its core voters.    Responding to the opposition, ministers Piyush Goyal and Venkaiah Naidu mounted a strong defence, ruling out any concession by way of allowing use of old currency beyond the permitted excep tions. Goyal said the bold decision forcefully buries allegations that the Modi government was for big business while Naidu said people were willing to put up with some pain for future gain.    Goyal said demonetisation showed that if anyone had the strength to take on black money and corruption, it was the Modi government. He added that initial difficulties were due to the need for secrecy.    No honest taxpayer would lose a single rupee while those with unaccounted wealth and terror organisations thriving on extortion would suffer, said Goyal. CPM's Sitaram Yechury supported the action ag ainst black money , but said only 6% of such money in India is in cash. He added that demonetisation would not curb illicit wealth. Raising doubts whether the government move would put an end to black money , Yechury said, ""The PM is cleaning the pond to kill the crocodile. Crocodiles can survive outside water, but small fish are dying... It is no longer Jai Hind, PM appears in ads and says Jio Hind.""    Congress's Pramod Tiwari caused a mini-flutter by stating that Modi has joined the league of leaders like Hitler, Mussolini and Gaddafi who also demonetised currency in their country . ""No civilised nation has done this,"" he said, causing an immediate protest from Ravi Shankar Prasad.    Earlier, Anand Sharma wondered why the government has turned 86% of currency illegal when by its own admission only 0.02% currency notes are fake. ""This is some kind of an undeclared Emergency ,"" he said.    Mayawati said the PM had not undertaken sufficient measures during the 10 months of preparation for demonetisation to ensure that people did not suffer. She alleged the government took all this time to channelise the high-value currency notes of BJP and to give a hint to the rich to take care of their deposits. Rival SP's Ram Gopal Yadav said the situation is worse than Emergency when at least food was available.    JD (U) member Sharad Yadav said demonetisation has resulted in distress sale of paddy in villages and farmers are unable to buy seeds and fertilisers.    Maintaining that the country is tired of Modi's theatrics, be it his claim that he renounced his family to serve the nation or that people want to kill him, Sharma said, ""He changes clothes five times a day and says he has renounced everything. As for threat to his life it is a serious matter and nation should know who wants to kill him.""",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Its-economic-anarchy-opposition-on-demonetisation/articleshow/55467155.cms,

The Central Bank of India branch in Gulmohar Park, for one, had many complainants, many of whom pleaded in vain with the bank volunteers to relax the rule. There were few who could triumph in their inked finger, among them a handful at Jor Bagh's Dena Bank.    Under the circumstances, people continued to be denied their money . Vinod Kumar, a youngster who works in a south Delhi restaurant, began his stake out at the SBI branch at Old JNU Campus at 6am, desperate and determined after having failed to get any cash there on three earlier days or at two other banks in the locality.    Kushi Ram, a guard at an HDFC branch in Old Delhi, is a victim of such persistence. He hasn't gone home in five days for fear of people setting up beds at the bank entrance.    People are also coming to are as in the city that they think are better serviced by banks than their localities.    Such thoughts brought Minakshi Bansal and her husband to Hauz Khas from Usmanpur, the latter forced to apply for leave at his workplace to make the trip. Computer operator Si nod Kumar Kamat came from Faridababd to the SBI branch at Green Park with his 9-month-old daughter and wife, who stood in the women's queue to have better odds at getting to the exchange counter.

2016-11-17 08:41:00,Demonetisation: Massive deposit bonanza for banks pulls down interest rates,"MUMBAI: The money flooding into banks as people rush to deposit Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has resulted in such a massive bonanza that it's pulling rates down, bankers said. Thus the longstanding complaint of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that banks weren't passing on rate reductions may be addressed soon.    Banks ran out of currency in the Capital and elsewhere, although some cities reported that queues had shortened. In Parliament, the opposition parties attacked the government over the withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, saying it was insensitive, caused hardship to people and had unleashed ""economic anarchy"".    State Bank of India (SBI) reduced rates on deposits from one year to 455 days to 6.90%, down 15 basis points, while keeping the 7% rate for deposits between 211 days to one year unchanged. That may not be great news for those putting their money in banks but lending rates are likely to follow suit in a few weeks, possibly giving sluggish credit expansion a much-needed boost and shoring up growth. Abasis point is 0.01percentage point.    ""All rates will fall,"" said SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya. ""The bank has seen huge inflow of deposits but demand for credit has slowed down. Therefore, lending rates too will fall but after a gap.""    Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 were being scrapped from November 9 as part of the push against black money, counterfeiting and corruption, it's estimated that the banks have collected deposits worth a total Rs 4 lakh crore. To put that number in perspective, the government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it expected close to Rs 10 lakh crore to be deposited in banks by the end of December 30, which is when they will stop exchanging the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Deposits collected by State Bank of India and its five associate banks amounted to Rs 1 lakh crore until Wednesday.    SBI and its units make up about a fourth of the banking system. Among private banks, Axis Bank took the lead by cutting lending rates by 15-20 basis points.    The bank will charge 9.05% on one-year loan, which is higher than 8.90% by SBI, the country's largest bank.    Executives at Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India told ET they would be looking at cutting deposit rates soon.    According to RBI data, total deposits in the system are close to Rs 100 lakh crore. A Rs 4 lakh crore addition to this base is equivalent to the cash reserve ratio, the slice of deposits that banks have to park with the central bank.    ""This kind of deposit collection is as good as a cut in CRR by 4% and this will lead to interest rate transmission without a cut in policy rates,"" said R Marathe, managing director and CEO of Bank of Maharashtra.    CRR is currently at 4%. In the past few years, RBI has nudged banks several times to pass on cuts in key rates to end customers.    Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan made the point repeatedly during his tenure.    Shubhada Rao, chief economist, Yes Bank, said: ""We expect banks to reduce deposit rates by 75-100 bps over the next six-nine months. The new regime of MCLR will immediately take into account the lower cost and will thereby lead to a decline in lending rates and improved transmission."" Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate, or MCLR, is the methodology introduced by RBI last year that banks use to set rates.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Massive-deposit-bonanza-for-banks-pulls-down-interest-rates/articleshow/55468339.cms,
2016-11-17 08:19:00,Demonetisation may lead to rise in wheat price,"KANPUR: The demonetisation, which has also effected the farming practices, may result in a hike in wheat prices in future.    Farmers are unable to purchase seeds, necessary fertilizers and other important things in absence of lower denomination currency notes, delaying the sowing of wheat crop. And the delay may bring a rise in wheat rates ultimately increasing the prices of various food items.    In north India the best time to sow wheat crop is from November 1 to 10 and if it is delayed till December 10 then both the quality and yield get affected.    ""This is the perfect time to sow seeds for wheat crop to yield the best quality but as we have no money in lower denomination currency notes it would be delayed. The delay will result in bad quality and low yield,"" said farmer Dhram Singh, a resident of Gagan Kheda village, Sarsaul, Kanpur.    ""Though one can sow wheat crop till December 15 but the prime time is between November 1 and November 20. The productivity in such land where seeds will be sown late will degrade. On every one acre of land there would be a loss of five to seven quintals of the crop,' he added.    Another elderly farmer of the same village, Surendra Singh Yadav said, ""We dont have new currency notes to buy seeds and fertilizers to sow wheat crop. We are getting only old currency notes from wholesalers by selling seasonal vegetables With the limit of only Rs 4,000 to exchange at a time and now indelible ink, how will we exchange big amount which is required when ATMs too are dispensing only Rs. 2000 that too after struggling for entire day.""    Agriculture experts have also claimed that demonetization will certainly affect the agriculture cycle which is totally depended on perfect timing of sowing crops.    Dr Karam Hussian from Agronomy department of Chandra Shekhar Azad Univeristy of agriculture and technology said at present there is a decline in the purchase of seeds from the seed store of university. From a sale of three lakh rupees per day of seeds, it has come down to around one lakh. Also If wheat is sown in December month, there would be a decline of 10 to 12 quintal of crop per acres, he added.    He also advised farmers to increase the quantity of seeds for sowing and do proper irrigation if they sow seeds in December.    ""But this finally will hike the price of the wheat,"" he added further.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/Demonetisation-may-lead-to-rise-in-wheat-price/articleshow/55468034.cms,kanpur

The foreign tourist is unable to spend his money, shop or buy a drink, or hire a taxi,"" Pronab Sarkar, head of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, told ET.His outfit has made a detailed representation to the ministry, saying that ""foreign tourists should not suffer...feel cheated"". India attracts maximum number of foreign tourists in November and December. Last year, the figure touched 1.7 million during these months. Large numbers have pre-booked tours this year as well, with the sector anticipating a major bump up in numbers. But the tourism minister is unfazed. ""We took it up with the finance ministry and old currency is permitted till November 24 at ASI (Archaeological Survey of India)-protected monuments. I cannot say at this point what will be done after that. However, it is not a crisis situation. Foreign tourists may be facing some cash crunch, but it isn't that big a problem as most of them use credit cards,"" Sharma told ET.But operators want more steps. They have urged that demonetised currency be allowed beyond November 24, until swipe machines are in place at monuments and museums. They also want the exchange ceiling to be relaxed for foreign tourists and have suggested that scrapped notes be accepted for road tax by state governments. ""This is right in the middle of the Pushkar fair, which draws huge number of international tourists. But more than the timing, it's the mismanagement,"" Sarkar said. ""All payments have come to a standstill, leaving us in a big soup. The limit to withdraw Rs 50,000 per week is nothing for a tour company which has to make many small-value cash payments — ranging from guides to entry tickets,"" he added.Marzban Antia of the Travel Agents Association of India said the industry will take months from recover from the ""shock"". ""I don't see any kind of recovery right up to April or even July. Travel, hospitality to hotel occupancy — everything has been hit. We are still to assess the full impact. They should have injected enough Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes. That's where the government has not managed to get things back together.

At present, midday meals are served to 32 lakh students in 56,000 government-run schools of the state.    As teachers can't afford to spend their valuable time queuing up in banks and ATMs for cash, the money to buy food is slowly drying up. ""In many sub-divisions of the state, schools are spending money very carefully because the teachers can neither wait in queue to withdraw money from banks, nor can they spend their valuable time in exchanging higher denomination currency notes for buying food for children,"" said Jiban Chandra Borah, president of Assam State Primary Teachers' Association.    Though the Food Corporation of India (FCI) supplies rice to government-run schools for cooking midday meal, vegetables and other necessary items need to be bought for cooking food. However, sources in the education department said proper implementation of midday meal scheme is top priority of the government.    Apart from teaching, the teachers have to manage midday meals for students up to Class 8. ""Buying pulses, mustard oil and other food items is a costly affair nowadays.

Farmers readying for Rabi sowing are bearing the brunt as they are not able to sell their crops in mandis that would help them get valid cash to purchase seeds and their daily needs. Despite state government's instruction to use RTGS (Right Time Gross Settlement) facility to pay money to the farmers, traders seem to be unwilling to use it.""Out of the total 257 mandis, only 120 have opened due to shortage of smaller denomination currency. We are hopeful that in a day or two, we will be able to open 200 mandis to facilitate farmers,"" said Rakesh Shrivastava, managing director of Madhya Pradesh State Agriculture Marketing Board.He said that the traders have been asked to use RTGS facility but the income is so less that they have no money in their accounts to pay to the farmers.""After Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan instructed banks to extend the timings of RTGS, it is being done till 6 pm from earlier 4 pm,"" he said.On the latest decision of the RBI to not allow local cooperative banks to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, he said that the government was trying to help farmers.

Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh said PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation decision was not dictated by economic reasons but by the political desire to ""create tremors"" to send a message that he had taken a momentous decision.    ""Prospects of recovery in the rural, agriculture and unorganised economy in the next 12 months get very remote. I feel there is not going to be any growth in rural, agriculture and unorganised sector economy,"" he told reporters.    ""My considered view is that in the next six to 12 months, the impact on GDP will not be positive,"" he added.    The Rajya Sabha MP said demonetisation would bring more cash to banks but raised the questions about big defaulters earning reprieve from banks. ""We do not want the cash infusion into banks to write off Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi and all the other NPAs that have been accumulated. If that happens, and I suspect that is going to happen, it is a mockery of the November 8 statement,"" he added.    Attacking the PM and the finance minister over the move, he said while the government talked of the Rs 1.25 lakh crore black money unearthed during the first two-and-a-half years of Modi government, it did not talk of the Rs 1.33 lakh crore black money unearthed during the last two years of the UPA government.

Bill Gates+  was zipping around in a phut phut (modified three-wheeler) for a virtual reality film being shot on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    Since 2002, when it started operations in India, the foundation has invested $1 billion in India. It's looking to do much more in the country. ""I am very optimistic on India. Even if one of my ideas contributes to making a difference to the lives of 1.3 billion Indians, it will be huge for me,"" Gates told TOI in an exclusive interaction.    He was referring to the ideas he shared during his lecture on technology for transformation at Niti Ayog on Wednesday. The lecture was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,  finance minister Arun Jaitley+  along with other ministers and top officials.    Gates believes digital payments can transform the lives of poor, and if  demonetisation+  helps quicken digitisation, the temporary pains may be worth going through.    ""Government transitions are never managed perfectly and never easy,"" he said, referring to the transitory problems caused by the replacement of high-value currency notes.    ""India is pushing towards digitisation in a big way. The scale of the country means that once India gets there, the amount of digital innovation here will be greater than anywhere else in the world,"" Gates said. Among big benefits of digital financial transactions, he counted a deep reduction in the cost of borrowing for the poor.    Swachh Bharat is another government initiative Gates is excited about. His foundation is working with California Institute of Technology to develop what he calls a ""reinvented toilet"" that will dispose of waste without the toilet being connected to a sewage system.    The India that Gates sees now is very different from the one he saw during his active years with Microsoft. ""Now I am more in Patna than in Hyderabad and Bangalore.

2016-11-18 13:19:00,Growth be will slow due to demonetization: Expert,"NAGPUR:  ""National GDP will fall below 6% in the aftermath of the demonetization,"" said chief operating officer and chief economist at BSE Brokers Forum V Aditya Srinivas during a discussion on the after effects, in India and world economy, of the demonetization policy. The event was held at Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), Civil Lines, on Wednesday.    This, Srinivas said, will happen because a large sum of money has been removed from circulation, inhibiting purchases of fast moving consumer goods, which are usually purchased in hard cash. Srinivas, along with economist and chartered accountant Tejinder Singh Rawal, explained the implications of demonetization to students, professionals and businessmen present at the discussion.    He also said, ""The movement of currency has stopped after demonetization, which is slowing the economy down."" Workers in the steel, aluminium, construction and real estate sectors are not getting paid and as a result work in these sectors has stopped, said Srinivas.    Highlighting the benefits of this slowdown, Srinivas opined that current scenarios are favourable for buying real estate and automobiles, since RBI has slashed repo rates to the banks. However, he cautioned that this benefit can only be availed if banks are willing to pass it down to consumers. He also cautioned against buying land as an investment since there will be no returns.    Srinivas spoke briefly about the impact the recent US presidential elections will have on world economy. He said, ""US contributes to 23% of the world GDP and because its share is the highest of any other country, the current political instability there will have severe consequences on global economy.""    Rawal believes it was inevitable that a large section of the society will face problems after demonetization since they have never used banking services. Those who were able to exchange their old notes will hoard new currency until they are confident that enough money is in circulation for them to use the highest denomination, which was recently issued, said Rawal.    Whether we can become a cashless economy was the topic Rawal touched upon and said, ""With Jan Dhan Yojna, the government has made an effort to open as many bank accounts in rural areas as possible. But it will still take a lot of time to transition over to a cashless system.""    Rawal also pointed out that money held by the common man will see its value appreciate, since most of the unaccounted wealth is now deemed redundant. ""Approximately Rs400 crore was in circulation before demonetization which was affecting the economy badly. Now, since that money is no longer of any value, the legitimately acquired cash will gain more value than before,"" said Rawal.

The already acrimonious situation in the Rajya Sabha worsened after Azad asked who should be held responsible for the deaths of those affected by the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The treasury benches, led by information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu, immediately attacked Azad for trying to equate Pakistan-sponsored terrorism with the government's demonetisation decision. The remarks were later expunged but by then had played widely on social media and TV.    Later, parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar said, ""He is not an ordinary member of Congress party... He has made an anti-national statement comparing the unfortunate deaths...to those of our brave soldiers who were killed in Pakistani attack in Uri"".    The incident is likely to deepen the deadlock witnessed on Thursday. There seemed to be a realisation in the opposition camp that smooth of functioning of Rajya Sabha on Wednesday may result in the issue being ""closed"" in the House. This led to adjournments being forced in Rajya Sabha as well as Lok Sabha with the opposition demanding PM Narendra Modi's presence in the two Houses.    The government has made it clear that it will reject the opposition demand for a joint parliamentary probe into the alleged leak of information regarding demonetisation. ""Speculative reports in the press cannot be called a leak,"" finance minister and leader of the House in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said.    The trouble began when Azad got up to say that government policies were responsible for the deaths being reported. ""The PM should come here and explain,"" he said.    Naidu immediately responded, ""This is an atrocious statement. Leader of opposition is insulting the nation by making such remarks, by comparing this with Pakistan terror attacks.

The number of tourists recorded by the forest department this year was only six lakh against the footfall of nine lakh in 2015, registering a 33% drop in footfall. The Junagadh district administration and forest department had expected a greater rush at the five-day annual 'Lili Parikrama' around Mount Girnar, which began from November 11.    ""We were prepared for a footfall of around 10 lakh, but when the parikrama ended we recorded only six lakh. This was a considerable drop compared to last year's nine lakh,"" said Senthil Kumaran, deputy conservator of forest, Junagadh.    ""We have been told that there are two main reasons for the drop in footfall. One is that sowing is going on in the fields, and the second is the probable effect of demonetisation,"" said Kumaran. ""The non-availability of notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 kept away tourists from other parts of the state,"" he added.    ""Because of demonetization, half of the devotees had not come for Parikrama and over 30% provisions made for the Parikrama remained surplus,"" said Mansukh Bhanala of Princess Group, Surat. ""We came with full preparations and rations expecting a rush like last year, but there were fewer tourists than expected,'' he added.

The Parikrama, which passes through the Girnar Sanctuary was held between November 11 and November 14.

2016-11-18 03:59:00,"Demonetisation derails Thane’s resale, rental market","THANE: The gloom over the realty sector appears to have intensified following the demonetisation process which has shaken the confidence of consumers in the resale property market.    Members from the Thane real estate association claim that high uncertainty prevails as buyers prefer to wait and watch the market due to which transactions and sales have come to an almost standstill since last week.    The resale transactions comprise of nearly 25% of all the real estate deals inked in the lake city and business is centred in the old city areas like Naupada, Panchpakhadi, Khopat, Kopri,Vasant Vihar and even Ghodbunder Road.    ""Barely any resale flat deals have reached the final stage since the announcement of high value demonetization was made on November 8. The segment was always driven by a notable cash component. Now, it would be almost impossible for such deals to be carried out unless either of the parties take a risk. Few deals that were made before the announcement are also being postponed or brought again to the negotiating table,"" said Rajesh Gadgil, president of the real estate association at Thane.    The buying and selling of flats involves part black and part white payment components. The deals are usually done with 60% white and 40% black to avoid capital gains on properties, say experts. With the demonetization of such high value notes, it has become a sticky terrain for both sellers and buyers and both are opting to wait and watch before inking their respective deals.    Meanwhile, buyers are also sceptical of the fate of such properties whose rates could possibly tumble down if the demonetization plan works out in the long run.    The eleven registrar offices across Thane also saw footfalls over the last one week but the real impact, say officials, will be seen in the next fortnight as parties that finalize a deal take at least a week or more to come and register them. ""The low turnout at offices could possibly be because of the lull after the festive season. We expect to get a correct impact of the demonetization only by month end,"" said a state revenue officer.    In addition, experts fear that the rental market will also suffer an impact where a notable volume of transaction often happens through cash. The volume of distress sales, though low, is likely to happen with sellers ready to forsake nearly 25-30%. Even few rookie investors might end up panicked and try to dispose off their properties and absorb a loss of few lakhs, observe experts.    ""Those who want to urgently dispose their properties either to migrate or to meet any other personal financial requirements might be ready to sell at lesser than the market rates.

2016-11-18 05:59:00,Demonetisation serves as poll fodder,"PUNE: Politics over demonetisation is all set to dominate the local polls in the state.    Almost the entire state will vote in the elections for 206 nagar panchayats, 15 municipal corporations, 26 zilla parishads and 297 panchayat samitis between November 2016 and March 2017.    The BJP had planned a rout of the Congress and the NCP. Both have traditionally dominated local politics in panchayats and councils. However, the Centre's decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has changed the mood of the political campaign in the state.    Sensing the resentment against the government and the BJP, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis pleaded with the people to 'bear with the suffering'. For Fadnavis, these polls are an acid test and he has announced that the election results will be seen as a verdict on the two-year rule of the BJP government in the state.    Speaking in Ahmednagar on Wednesday, Fadnavis said, ""Prime Minister has sought 50 days. On the border our soldiers are fighting, risking their lives. That is serving the nation. Now, this suffering (because of demonetisation) to exchange currency is also serving the nation. Being honest is deshbhakti. If there is inconvenience, face it and suffer a bit.""    BJP sources said Fadnavis and other BJP leaders fear that the party may suffer a setback because of the demonetisation decision as common people are agitated with banks and ATMs running dry.    The Congress and the NCP have made the government's decision of scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 their poll plank, setting aside local issues. Cashing in on this anger, the Congress has launched an offensive against the BJP government. ""Demonetisation is a surgical strike on the common people. The government's decision has rattled the economy and poor people are major sufferers,"" state Congress president Ashok Chavan said in Solapur.    He added, ""In the name of acche din, the government is making people suffer. Now it is time for people to retaliate, and I am sure they will show their anger in these (local) elections.""    ""People are in no mood to listen to any logic defending the central government's decision. Local party candidates are now under tremendous pressure as they are facing questions from angry voters. The state unit of the BJP is trying to mitigate the situation by asking its cadre to help people standing in the queue withdraw cash from banks and ATMs,"" a senior party leader said.    BJP leaders are on defensive and finding it difficult to convince voters that the local elections are about civic amenities and not the central government's decision.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Demonetisation-serves-as-poll-fodder/articleshow/55483907.cms,pune

Had this been any regular day, we would not even had time to sit as we have customers coming in constantly."" Raj Ahuja, owner of stationery shop was hit even more with business dropping by 90%.

While disproportionate assets and black money are hoarded in the form of jewels, property and foreign bank accounts, the government seems to be targeting only the general public, the pamphlet said.

2016-11-18 09:06:00,Demonetising: Parts from China on the way to help banks get ATMs running,"NEW DELHI: It’s been more than a week since Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were scrapped but only about 22,500 — or a tenth of the country’s 202,000 automated teller machines — have been tweaked to accept new notes. That slow pace, which has no doubt played a key role in exacerbating public anxiety, has got something to do with the machines needing new parts that are in short supply and are now being rushed to India, said a senior official. “These are being purchased from China,” the official said.    “The magnetic component and the hardware, also known as magnetic spacer and wedge, are not in stock. Once we have the supplies, it should not take more than a week to get all ATMs running.” State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said, however, that not all machines need these parts. “Adequate supplies have been lined up and are now getting continuously received.      Also read:    Banks left stumped as rules change faster than currency notes  This will not pose a problem,” she said. A senior finance ministry official said some banks have told the government that the situation is manageable. “It is not a big problem and banks are sourcing the supplies,” he said.

If it cannot weigh, it will not work,” said the official.

Superintendent of police (ATS) Vikas Kumar said that the IS operative was planning to travel to Dubai via Mumbai on November 17. But the ATS team contacted Ahmed on Wednesday, and posing as a passport officer, Kumar asked Ahmed to come to his `office' for qu estioning on account of some discrepancies in the documents of his children.Subsequently, ATS nabbed him and took him to Jaipur for further questioning.    ""The initial interrogation revealed that Ahmed had become a trusted fundraiser for IS commanders.He was familiar with hawala transit routes, which enabled him to deliver money to IS-held areas thro ugh Lebanon and Turkey,"" Vikas Kumar told TOI.    On Thursday afternoon, after a local court sent Ahmed on a seven-day remand, a field team of ATS landed in Mumbai to question Ahmed's family. To ATS' surprise, Ahmed had accumulated properties to the tune of Rs 5 crore in Mumbai. ""We wanted to know two things: First, why did he move his family from Dubai to Mumbai, and, secondly, was he planning to amass property for his wife and five kids so that he could fight alongside IS commanders in Syria and Iraq,"" Kumar said.    The ATS top brass suspect that Ahmed had established contacts with several top ranking terror commander of IS such as Abu Hurayra alHindi. ""Ahmed knew Mohammad Sirajuddin, an IS recruiter who was arrested from Jaipur, although the two had never met. Ahmed also knew Sirajuddin's Filipino friend, another IS recruiter herself,"" sources said.The arrest of Ahmed and probe into his modus operan di have set alarm bells ringing for the intelligence agencies. Cops fear that IS can exploit India's well-oiled network of organised crime like hawala rackets to increase their base.    ""IS operates in shadows.Unlike Al-Qaeda or Lashkar, this outfit doesn't have any hierarchy of ranks. Most of its operatives know each other by code names or fake social media profiles.

2016-11-18 10:04:00,Chaos after demonetisation shows our reliance on cash,"The strike was surgical, even if the post-operative complications continue to be messy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock announcement of demonetisation of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes established one thing for sure - that he is capable of big, bold, risky moves.    When 86% of the currency in circulation becomes illegal virtually overnight, pain is inevitable. Given the cause that is at stake, there are many who look upon the inconvenience as a necessary price to pay, while others take a less generous view. For the poor, who have little access to alternative mechanisms of payment, the problem becomes a difficult one. The government also believes that this will hasten the shift to a cashless economy, making life easier and transparent.    While there is some debate about whether this move will produce desired results or it will backfire, there is another aspect of this situation that needs more reflection - the nature of the relationship we enjoy with cash. Cash is not merely a symbolic representation of value. Cash is the idea of value captured and owned. Sitting on a pile of cash gives pleasure both metaphorical and real. Cash is not preferred only by those who have avoided paying taxes; it is the instrument of choice for the country at large. This is why retail establishments across the country are facing a shrinking of demand; in theory, for most of these outlets, customers should be unaffected given an easy access to credit and debit cards.    With cash, value has a permanent residence, it 'settles down' with its owner, even if its role is to be in a state of constant circulation. Cash is not merely money in physical form, it changes the way we regard and spend it. It is easier, for instance, to spend money using a credit card, for the outflow seems more theoretical than it does when paying in cash. The difference between Rs 2,000 and Rs 20,000 is a slip of the pen in one case and a complex exercise involving withdrawing money from the bank, carrying it in one's wallet and counting it (twice) before handing it over. The tangibleness of cash is mirrored by the continuing need felt by many for one's passbook to be updated by pen and ink.    Earning money needs to be signified concretely. Those whose life's earnings are in the form of a few high-value currency notes, do not decode demonetisation in quite the same way as those used to money in its conceptual form. The idea that it is possible to delegitimise their life's labour is to shake the foundations on which one's life is constructed.    The talk of 'cashless' is easy, but it ignores that there is a cultural dimension to the physicality of cash. Digital wallets operate on a transfer of intention, where a promise to pay gets converted into an intention to buy. For this to work at scale, one needs to have become comfortable with the idea of surplus and develop the confidence that money will come without having to struggle or having to think about it all the time. One needs to develop trust in institutions, in a context where the evidence around is to the contrary. The reason why even in e-commerce, the innovation that unlocked the market was Cash On Delivery, is that even today there exists great anxiety about thinking of money in terms of a flicker of intention. Cash gives the individual control over value, it allows a transaction to sigh with satisfaction as it gets completed.    Psychologically, money works on a convention of mutual deception. We agree to call something money, and that is good enough. But to have the thinness of this convention exposed in such a way is to cause great anxiety.    To cut off 85% of one's currency even for a few days is akin to cutting off water or petrol. And unlike water and petrol, the reintroduction of currency cannot happen overnight. Apart from all the other arguments in favour of and against this move, what needs to be acknowledged is that it will cause an undercurrent of tentativeness, one that burrows itself deep in the cultural marrow of this country. Since there is little palpable sign of how much black money exists, the success of this move will always be invisible. The uncertainty might linger. Nobody wants to fight for what is already theirs. It is almost like having to re-earn what one has already laboured to earn.    Demand to go back to normal levels might not be automatic. The idea of economic progress is not statistical, but experiential and, in that sense creating, uncertainty about money might produce the unintended effect of unsettling people in a way that alters their sense of economic well-being. In a market economy, money is the measure of everything, and the measure itself becomes wobbly, one's entire world shivers",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Chaos-after-demonetisation-shows-our-reliance-on-cash/articleshow/55489182.cms,bhubaneswar

Residents are thronging MC offices to clear their dues with the banned currency.    According to the data, the amount collected under these heads has almost doubled in the last one week as compared to the previous week. The authorities have collected more than Rs 31lakh as property tax after the Centre's notification allowed the MC to accept old currency notes till November 24. A week prior to this notification, the authorities were able to collect only around Rs 16 lakh under the same head.    Besides property tax, the residents are also queuing up to pay their long pending watersewer bills.    The officials said around Rs 15 lakh was deposited with the MC on Thursday in just Zo ne D, whereas the total collection from November 11 to November 17 stood at Rs 29 lakh in this zone. There are four zones of MC. Interestingly , residents are even requesting the MC to accept bills in advance, which is not feasible.    MC officials maintained that apart from demonetization, the factor which prompted residents to pay bills is the exemption given to residents in depositing due amounts sans penalty and interest.    Sources said prior to receiving the formal notification on November 11 mentioning that the scrapped notes would be accepted for paying the arrears and property tax by the MC, only about Rs 26,000 was deposited under water sewerage charges.

The two chief ministers also visited the RBI office and submitted a list of questions on the availability of the currency.    At a public hearing organised at Azadpur Mandi, Kejriwal and Banerjee spoke at length about the problems being faced by the common man due to the scrapping of the old 500 and 1,000 notes. Kejriwal, who had on Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having allegedly accepted money from industrial houses, repeated his charges and flashed ""documents"" from the income-tax department to reinforce his point.

Recently some senior tax officials and experts were asked their opinion about such a step. The senior government officials seeking feedback or opinion on the issue is one of the main reasons why industry trackers say that such a step could be in the offing, said two people who spoke to ET.    ""What was asked was whether SIT proposal on reducing cash transactions was feasible. They wanted to know what could be the pushback or problems of implementing such a step,"" a person who refused to be identified said.

""The  demonetisation+  and a cap on cash withdrawal is a very positive step as this can just end the parallel economy as almost no black money would be generated. I see this step as a logical extension of government strategy to attack the black money, and it could have huge positive implications on Indian economy,"" said Rakesh Nangia, Managing Partner, Nangia and Co.    Experts say that such a step could mean that the war on black money will open up another flank and combined with  GST+  , such a proposal could go a long way.    ""As it is, black money would be highly hit due to GST and if the government goes ahead with the SIT recommendation it would be very good. Also, I think the government may allow some exceptions for holding more cash than prescribed and charge tax in some situations,"" said Uday Ved, a senior tax expert.    Industry trackers said the government could be looking to introduce such a step in the budget next year. The government can also announce such a change through a CBDT or an RBI circular. A questionnaire mailed to CBDT and the finance secretary on Wednesday did not elicit any response. ""There could a probability that such a step could just come in by budget because the government is leaving no stones unturned to attack the black money economy.

2016-11-18 12:39:00,Demonetization has hit 25% of NE's business: FINER,"GUWAHATI: About 25% of business in the northeast has been affected by the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, the Federation of Industry and Commerce of North Eastern Region (FINER) said on Thursday.    The slump, however, is temporary and the region's economy will benefit from the demonetization, FINER, one of the largest trade bodies in the northeast, said.    ""The construction sector and high-value goods have been hit by the demonetization in the northeast. Of the affected 25%, the construction business is the worst-hit. But we are confident that the setback is only temporary. The demonetization is going to revive the economy in the long run,"" FINER chairman Pabitra Buragohain said.    FINER, however, said it could not assess the monetary value of the total business in the region hit by demonetization.    ""Despite the setback, we have to reiterate that the demonetization is a bold move taken by the Centre. It will curb corruption and stop terror funding. So, this is going to have a long-term positive impact on the country's economy. We have to bear with the hardships in the transition phase,"" Buragohain added.    FINER has asked the Centre and state governments in the region to put in place effective mechanisms to reduce the hardships faced by people. ""There is an urgent need to improve the banking infrastructure in the northeast as we are moving towards a cashless economy,"" FINER vice president Bajrang Lohia said. ""In the northeast, there are a lot of agricultural and horticultural traders. They should be linked to the banks. The same should be done for roadside vendors,"" another FINER vice president Rajeev Agarwal said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/Demonetization-has-hit-25-of-NEs-business-FINER/articleshow/55492140.cms,guwahati
2016-11-19 08:30:00,Demonetisation: Top bankers had no clue; got a few hours to mount operation,"MUMBAI:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi+  maintained such a deep level of secrecy in executing the decision to  demonetise two-high value denominations+  , that even the top bankers of the country had no idea about the move till he went on air at 8 pm on November 8 to announce the decision to the world.    In the first week of November,  RBI officials+  informed the chairpersons and MDs of all the top banks in India about a meeting at the central bank's headquarters in south Mumbai scheduled for 7 pm on November 8. Uncharacteristically, the RBI didn't specify any particular agenda for the meeting, two bankers said. Usually, the central bank gives some notice to bankers when they are called for a meeting since it wants them to come prepared.    On the day of the meeting, convened on the 15th floor of the RBI's Mint Street headquarters, all the top bankers of India, each with more than three decades of experience in the sector, were in attendance.    The meeting started with RBI officials mainly discussing the situation pertaining to non-performing assets in the banking sector, a hot topic for the sector till that day. They discussed some other issues related as well. Just before 8 pm, RBI officials switched on the TVs in the room. They said that the PM would be on air soon, and they would continue the discussion after his speech, the bankers told TOI.    Until the time the PM had announced that India was scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in less than four hours, none of the top bankers had any clue that the next few days would be their careers' most challenging. ""Basically it was as much of a surprise to us as to anybody else,"" said SBI chairperson  Arundhati Bhattacharya+  . After the PM ended his speech, the bankers wanted to leave immediately and start work.    ""The mood (with everyone present) was just to get out of the place and get things in place. We had to get out quickly to tell our people to switch off the ATMs by midnight; about the evacuation the next day, which was a huge exercise, then to take care of the recalibration; in the branches, what would be the instructions because there was to be exchanges, Rs 10,000 withdrawals etc,"" the SBI chief added.    However, the RBI deputy governors listed out what was expected of them and the bankers scrambled to meet their teams. The SBI chairman, along with others, left the meeting between 9.30 pm and 9.45 pm. By the time she reached her home at Malabar Hills around 10 pm, she had called some of her top officials to her bungalow. Soon enough, the meeting started and went on until the early hours. The next three days proved to be a tough challenge for the banking veterans, but they say that things have since started to fall in place.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Top-bankers-had-no-clue-got-a-few-hours-to-mount-operation/articleshow/55503552.cms,
2016-11-19 01:00:00,Bizarre effects of demonetisation,"Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation policy came into effect to curb black money transactions, several out-of-the-world incidents have taken place. Here's looking at a few of them...      Discounted beverages for Sonam Gupta  Since a few days, a certain Sonam Gupta has gone viral on the internet. There are tons of memes and pictures of currency notes by the elusive Sonam being circulated. However, now the joke has taken a whole new turn. Taking advantage of this situation, a few restaurants in the Capital are offering special discounts for guests who are named Sonam Gupta. So, the namesakes can take their government-issued ID proof and avail a free drink or a discount on    the bill.  Man sent to prison afterex-wife refuses to accept banned currency notes as alimony  A 70-year-old from Kolkata landed in jail after he paid his former spouse alimony in banned currency notes. The man, Bijoy Seal, had to pay his ex-wife `8,000 every month as per the court's order. However, he hadn't paid her any money in the last four years. In November, he took loans and paid the entire amount in court. But, the notes had got banned by then. His    ex-wife stated that she would only accept new currency notes of `500 and `2,000 and also refused to accept payment via cheque. He was jailed.      Woman goes topless after standing in an ATM queue for hours      Frustrated after standing in a queue at an ATM for many hours, a young woman in New Delhi took off her T-shirt as a mark to protest against the shortage of currency notes all over the country. As bystanders stood shocked, a team of women police officers arrived from the nearby police station and took her with them.      Number of thefts halved      Increased surveillance by the railway police guards to keep a watch on hoarders transporting stashed `500 and `1000 notes, has led to a considerable drop in the number of theft cases. According to Government Railway Police (GRP) this is due to demonetisation. While earlier, 12 to 15 incidents were reported, now they have started receiving only six cases a day. Reportedly, overall robbery at railway stations has dropped by a massive 50 per cent — these include pickpocketing and bag lifting.      Photos and names of people on pieces of paper kept in queues outside ATMs in Kerala to avoid standing there for long hours      While the rest of the country is fed up with those long ATM lines, people in Kerala have come up with a brilliant plan for it. Instead of wasting their time standing in the queue, they have started placing pieces of paper to take their place, which allows them to relax and await their turn.      Banned currency notes and look-alike wallets sold on foothpaths in Mumbai      A look-alike of `500 and `1000 are being sold on a few footpaths in the city. And guess what? There are buyers for it, perhaps to save them for posterity!",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/Bizarre-effects-of-demonetisation/articleshow/55498156.cms,Bizarre-effects-of-demonetisation
2016-11-19 01:00:00,Cashing in on demonetisation,"TV shows often incorporate themes of festivals and wedding in their tracks. This time, they have shifted their gaze to the demonetisation move that has gripped the entire nation. It has become a talking point on the small screen where almost every channel has shows with plots highlighting the plight of the common man.  'May I Come In Madam?'  Sajan (Sandeep Aanand) plays a common man in the show, who has never seen a wad of notes in his life. But he is stuck in a situation where he ends up with many `500 and 1000 notes and does not know what to do with them now.  'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah'  Jethalal (Dilip Joshi) is left with lakhs of rupees and starts panicking as he doesn't know how to dispose off the money. Similar situations will arise for other characters, too, in the show.  'Zindagi Ki Mahek'  Harish (Ajiz Quarshi) has a huge suitcase filled with `500 and 1000 notes. Karuna (Rajshree Feem), who is equally worried, suggests distributing the money to beggars.  'Chidiya Ghar'  The three lead characters — Ghotak (Paresh Ganatra), Kapi (Saransh Verma) and Gomukh (Sumit Arora) — will get anxious as they will have to think of ways of how to deposit money in the bank after being left with lakhs of rupees. In some situations, it will be the boss blackmailing the employee that if he does not help him dispose off the money, the employee won't get promotion or someone else will be left with lakhs of rupees as a gift even after the latter denies to accept so much money in cash.  'Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai'  Angoori bhabhi goes to the market with a `500 note and she has to come back empty-handed as no one accepts it. Her husband Manmohan Tiwari (Rohitashv Gaud) almost faints when he comes to know of the new rule, because he also has money stocked in his house.  'Devanshi'  The little girl Devanshi (Kashvi Kothari) goes to the market to buy a pair of silver shoes and is disappointed that her `500 note is not accepted as a result of the new rule. Later, a shopkeeper explains to her that she needs to deposit that money in the bank.  'Thapki...Pyar Ki'  Sehban Azim, who has entered the show recently, is a rich man and flaunts his wealth by waving a large wad of notes. Surprisingly, the demonetisation rule does not shock him as he feels it will not make any difference to him.

2016-11-19 02:00:00,Study to assess benefits of demonetisation,"KOLKATA: If long queues outside banks have become a part of our collective visual consciousness, here is a group of researchers who are studying every parameter of these queues so that they can quantify the phenomenon, add value to it and submit a report to the finance ministry about the loss vis-a-vis the national gain. The Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI), headquartered in the city, has started the research and is likely to come up with the report before the year-end.    The institute feels the demonetization may cause inconvenience for the public in the short run, but the move will rake in a lot of undeclared cash. Once the institute arrives at a figure (gap analysis) for the loss, not only will it be weighed against the total value that the banks have gained during this period but also how long it will take for the economy to make up for this loss.    ""With so many people staying off work to queue up at the banks, it is obvious that there will be a huge loss. But is that more than the amount that was part of the parallel economy so long and is now being banked? We are trying to find out,"" said Manash Kumar Thakur, President of ICAI.    ""If we find through our study that this loss of man-hours can be made up in the next four to five years, we will advise the government to go for another financial reform on similar lines in five years. Every modern economy should go through such repeated reformatory measures every four to five years,"" he said.    In India, the first such step was taken in 1965 and then again in 1978. ""Thereafter, it took 38 years for the Centre to come up with such a tough measure. That is the reason why black money spawned in India and a parallel economy ran so successfully,"" Thakur said. Already, a number of banks have declared that their interest rates on fixed deposits have been slashed, though the RBI is yet to go for a blanket directive, the Institute officials pointed out.    ""This shows that a lot of money is entering the coffers of the banks. This is actually good news because this has a direct bearing on inflation, which will definitely show a downward slide now. This will also encourage people to spend more in the market and discourage hording. The ultimate result will be appreciated by the masses because prices will also show a downward slide,"" said Biswarup Basu, secretary of ICAI.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Study-to-assess-benefits-of-demonetisation/articleshow/55502926.cms,kolkata
2016-11-19 01:16:00,Unorganised sector suffers huge losses post demonetisation,"GURGAON: With limited access to banking, plastic money and mobile wallets, the unorganised sector has borne the brunt of the government's demonetisation drive. And because the effects are not immediately visible except to the sufferer, there is a wall of silence surrounding it. From the local vegetable seller to the petty cloth merchant, the potter and the sweetmeat seller, everyone claimed having faced a 30-60% fall in daily business.    ""Business has been hit by almost 50%, as customers do not have cash. The few that do come, arrive with the new Rs 2,000 — evidently to get scarce small change — and we just have to turn them away,"" said Shri Ram, 66, a garment shop owner in Sadar Bazar, Gurgaon.    Shri Ram has a credit card swipe machine, but given that usually, 75% of his payments are in cash, business has been badly hit.    Just metres away, Altaf, 38, who sells trinkets and cheap copycat watches in a by-lane of Sadar Bazar, said his sales, too, have plummeted 50%. He admitted he hasn't earned much in the past week. ""I didn't have cash to buy more stock. I'm just trying to sell whatever I have, and that too is also not selling.""    However, even in times of difficulty, some petty businessmen are keeping their hopes alive. Ram Kumar, 48, the owner of Sach Bhojanalaya, a small dhaba near Sukhrali, thinks it is a little inconvenience for a greater cause. When people tried to pay with old Rs 500 notes, he said he waived off the payment. He's also maintaining a ledger of people who he has been feeding on credit.    Vinod Kumar, vegetable seller, Sikandarpur    With very little work, Vinod Kumar, 31, sits on a makeshift pedestal, ruing the fact that from buying vegetables worth Rs 10,000, from the wholesale dealer, he's down to buying stock worth Rs 3-4,000 daily. ""Few people are visiting the market, and those who do, buy little,"" he says. Right after demonetisation, he managed to dump his stock of old currency at the wholesale mandi, but they have stopped taking those now. Nowadays, he spends most of his time chatting with his friend. ""My world came crashing down on the November 9,"" says Kumar.    Pawan Poorwal, clothes vendor, Sadar Bazar    Standing in front of his cart stacked with cheap denims in busy Sadar Bazar, Pawan Poorwal, 33, is zealously trying to convince a customer to buy a pair. The customer walks away. Poorwal screams ""Rs 300"", a discount of Rs 200. The customer doesn't turn back. Poorwal says he's finding it hard to sell enough for sustenance. ""People will fend for food first. No one wants to buy clothes,"" he says. Poorwal says his sales have fallen by 60%. ""I'm from Kanpur. I send money to my family. How'll I look after them?"" he asks.    Deepanshu Aggarwal, sweetmeat shop owner, Sadar Bazar    Deepanshu Aggarwal, 27, runs a sweetmeat shop in the heart of Sadar Bazar. His main concern is the inability to tender change when people show up with a new Rs 2,000 note. His business has been affected marginally. ""I deposited Rs 50,000, some of which belonged to my eight employees,"" he said. ""If they go and stand in queue, who will work here?"" Aggarwal, a young entrepreneur, is hopeful the government's move will reduce fake currency. For now, his suppliers have been generous enough to give him credit.    Rahat Khan, pottery shop owner, Sukhrahali    Khan, 32, was leisurely reading a newspaper when he was surprised by his first customer of the day. In a candid chat, Khan said his business has been badly. Earlier he used to make Rs 2,000-3,000 a day, he says, while now, he doesn't even cross Rs 1,000. He says till Saturday, he accepted old notes, but after he experienced his first queue at a bank, he stopped. He says, ""I manage daily expenses with the small change I make. But kids' school fees, shop and house rents are all pending, and I don't really know how I'll manage.""    Raj Kumar, fruit shop onwer, Krishna Market    Raj Kumar, 25, says his sales have been hit by 60%. A look at the deserted fruit and vegetable market validates his claim. ""From Rs 7,000-8,000 a day, I now make Rs 2,000. My regular customers are using cards to buy online or from big stores,"" said Kumar. Home expenses are being managed on credit, as he can't shut shop to stand in a bank queue. He added many customers are trying to use old currency, but Kumar has decided to decline such offers.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/Unorganised-sector-suffers-huge-losses-post-demonetisation/articleshow/55504114.cms,gurgaon
2016-11-19 03:25:00,Hinterlands grapple with demonetization,"Dhave: Priyanka Mankar resides in the sleepy hamlet of Dhave, Sattari. She struggles daily to arrange for household necessities in the absence of a banking system in her village, ever since the demonetization announcement. Despite managing to exchange some of her family’s savings via a bank in distant Valpoi, the new 2,000 currency is of no help since grocery shops do not have small change for her new currency.    “We have to make do with whatever groceries are left with us. We are forced to manage until new notes of 500 and more of 100 comes in,” she said.    India’s cash crunch has hit the countryside the hardest as citizens residing in some of the interior villages and hinterlands do not have access to ATMs or banks.    In the tranquil villages of Dhave, Nagargao and Ustem in Sattari taluka, people are desperately waiting for currency of lower denominations as the cash crunch, post-demonetization of 500 and 1,000 notes, has put them in a tough spot.    Several other villages like Charawane, Hivere, Golauli, Khadiki in Sattari also don’t have access to banking infrastructure. The nearest bank access is in suburban Valpoi for these villages, and villagers have been making a beeline for this suburb.    “The queues in banks and outside the banks are serpentine,” said Nagargao resident, Vishnu Paryekar “Residents of all the villages around Valpoi come to exchange their money daily, and ATM’s run dry immediately.”    Dhave resident, Chandrakant Gaonkar said, “I go to a cooperative-credit society in the neighbouring village to exchange currency, and then I have wait in queue at an ATM in Valpoi for 100 notes. Half my day is spent just doing this. How are we to run a business then?”    For some, even making this journey to Valpoi is fruitless.    Ustem resident, Ashok Ustekar said that he has had to stand in a queue thrice since the demonetization announcement was made, but it is all in vain.    “In desperation, I asked a friend to loan me some money to manage my expenditure,” he said.    A senior citizen, Rukmini Pivulkar said that her entire day goes by in the hunt for currency, “There are no public buses in this area, let alone ATMs. We have to either wait for the single bus that operates only thrice a day or try to hitch-hike a ride. Once there, waiting in the long queues to exchange money takes so much time!”    Bankers in Valpoi told TOI that the amount of currency coming in is much lesser as compared to the bigger bank branches, which creates problems while dispensing money.    “We require 7-8 lakh on any given day but right now we don’t even get 5 lakh for disbursal,” said Goa state cooperative credit society, Valpoi branch manager, Pradeep Avkale.    “People are agitated because of this. We try to talk to them and somehow manage to convince them, but there remains a serious shortage of cash,” said branch manager at SBI Valpoi, Sandhya Nevge.    The bigger challenge that banking staff face is briefing villagers about demonetization. “They need to be explained what demonetization means, what happens to their money and how to deal with the situation. All of this has to be managed in addition to doing the actual currency exchange. It’s tough, but we will overcome,” Avkale said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Hinterlands-grapple-with-demonetization/articleshow/55503496.cms,goa

2016-11-19 04:00:00,Deposits post demonetisation have crossed Rs 4 lakh cr: Banks,"Mumbai: Total deposit mobilisation by banks crossed Rs 4 lakh crore on November 14, according to the Indian Banks' Association. The amount is expected to have since gone up as State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, has seen ""demonetisation deposits"" grow from Rs 1.04 lakh crore on November 14 to Rs 1.34 lakh crore at 4pm on November 18.    According to SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, a large part of the deposits would be withdrawn as depositors get back to spending. But 10-15% of the money that citizens have been forced to deposit in banks should stay back, she said.    Speaking to TOI, Bhattacharya said that SBI has done 11 crore transactions since demonetisation and has collected deposits of Rs 1.34 lakh crore. Part of the reason for the higher number of transactions was that a large number of citizens were turning up to exchange notes, with several suspected to be repeat visitors.    According to Bhattacharya, the mechanism for exchange of notes was being misused and even though there have been issues with supply of indelible ink, the talk of using it helped a lot. ""I think about 75% of the people were not doing their own stuff. They were being used by others to change money,"" said Bhattacharya.    The SBI chief said that there was an initial panic after customers saw ATMs run dry. ""The empty ATMs were associated with a cash shortage. They did not realise that there are logistics issues and a need to recalibrate the machines,"" said Bhattacharya. She added that ATMs are today playing a pivotal role in banking.    ""There is no shortage of Rs 100 notes, but we have to be careful on how to give them out as they are also required in ATMs. We have given out a huge amount of Rs 100 notes, I think people are just not spending them. I have been requesting people that 'for heaven's sake, spend. The RBI is constantly printing, so supplies will continue. So please spend. If you don't spend it, it will not go around'. This is the message we are trying to send,"" said Bhattacharya.    ""Things are settling down. On an average, we used to do about 75 lakh ATM transactions daily before the demonetisation. In the last 24 hours, we have done 73 lakh transactions. So ATM transactions are sort of coming back up to speed,"" she said. Of the 44,000 ATMs of the bank, around 13,000 are already dispensing Rs 2,000 notes. With all the ATMs now being functional, things have stabilised. ""We are witnessing normal activity coming back. So employees are again starting to report how many loans they have given and all,"" Bhattacharya said.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Deposits-post-demonetisation-have-crossed-Rs-4-lakh-cr-Banks/articleshow/55503798.cms,

A team of 50 people, including professors, teachers and students, interviewed 4,825 people across the city.    The city was divided into five zones viz. east, west, north, south and central for ease of data calculation. Four questions were asked to the public to which they had to answer yes, no or can't say.    The first question asked was whether they were aware that Rs500 and Rs1000 bank notes are no longer legal tender. Everyone who was asked this question said they were aware of the move.

2016-11-21 13:24:00,City cafés face the brunt of demonetisation,"Visakhapatnam: With cash crunch still persisting, cafes and coffee shops that are frequented by the young and middle-aged groups are facing a drop in business and bearing the brunt of demonetisation in the Port City.    Known for its cosmopolitan culture, Vizag has more than a dozen cafes and coffee shops at various areas such as Siripuram, Daspalla Hills, Waltair Uplands and Beach Road to name a few. Those equipped to deal with both cash and card transactions too are facing a slowdown for the past one week as the number of visitors have dropped by up to 40%.    Asked about the effect of demonetisation, Zushan Ali of The Gallery at Siripuram, said, ""Of course, we too have been affected by the shortage of cash. We are almost facing a 40% drop in business due to this. We can understand that customers are unable to visit because many of them are able to get only Rs 2,000 from their ATMs per day."" At the same time, he said, ""It's not just customers, we are also facing hurdles to pay for the day-to-day expenses at our cafe.""    Meanwhile, Sashikant Kumar of Moksha Restocafe at Daspalla Hills said, ""It has affected us a lot, not just a bit. We are down by 50% and this is generally a season for good business. Even people who have money in the bank are not willing to spend any money now and there is this whole sense of fear in the market about saving. This is affecting all the businesses. So it could take another quarter to recover from the slump.""    Pointing out that transactions through digital wallets had increased by almost 100%, he said, ""The sudden decision has affected us as we were not taking cards until now because the ATM was just below our cafe. It's the same with people, just because we are not able to take Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, we are losing customers.""    Meanwhile, Sumanth Behera, partner of Plot 17, a cafe at Gangapur Layout, said in order to offset the losses, they had resorted to providing special offers to customers wanting to pay with the old Rs 500 notes during the first three days of the demonetisation drive. ""The first three days were a bit difficult so we took Rs 500 notes and gave food worth Rs 600 to our customers. So that helped us out a bit.""

When the temple authorities sat down to count the donations for the period from September 1 to November 10, the total came up to Rs 1,23,09,561, which translates to Rs 1,73,374 each day.    The collection for this 71-day period, counted three days after Prime Minister Naremdra Modi's announcement, comprised 5,840 Rs 500 notes, and 906 notes of Rs 1,000 denomination.    On Wednesday, the temple authorities sat down to compute the total collection in the 18 hundis at the Nazarbad branch of Canara Bank for the November 11-16.    The total came up to Rs 74,38,880 - translating to an average donation of Rs 12,39,813 each day, a seven-fold increase in comparison to the daily collections recorded in the preceding period. The number of Rs 500 notes period collected in this six-day period came up to 3,371, while 424 Rs 1,000 notes were found. Oddly enough, even three 2,000 rupee notes were found in the collections that were counted on Wednesday. Special officer at the Chamundeshwari temple, Vijaykumar said that the temple would next calculate its collections on December 28 or 29.    However, temple authorities at the Sri Male Mahadewara temple atop the Mahadehwara hills in Kollegal taluk, said that they had stopped accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from devotees for pujas and services, following the Centre's demonetisation move.    Officials at the temple said that they had installed 12 CCTV cameras at the 23 hundis in the temple to deter people from dropping their old notes. ""Politicians donated cash and jewelleries to the temple. But, they have kept away after the higher denomination notes were removed from circulation,"" an official said.    The accounts superintendent at the temple, Mahadevaswamy told TOI that the holy place sees nearly four to five lakh devotees every month. ""The total donations came up to Rs 90 lakh. We have decided to count the collection in the hundis on Novermber 22,"" he added.

2016-11-19 06:20:00,Demonetisation sparks Sibal-Rohatgi verbal duel,"NEW DELHI: Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi and senior advocate and Congress member Kapil Sibal had a 'political' spat in the Supreme Court on Friday over people's woes post-demonetisation.    Appearing for advocate petitioners who have questioned the legality of demonetisation, Sibal reeled out statistics about non-availability of cash and withdrawal limits, non-functional ATMs, cash-starved banks and long queues to drive home the point about ""shoddy handling"" of the post-demonetisation situation by the Centre.    ""India is a cash-driven economy and the government has frozen circulation of cash. All economic activity in the country has come to a standstill. People are not being able to buy anything. The government is doing nothing to ease the woes of the general public,"" he said.    Already under fire from the SC for not taking enough measures to ease harassment of people forced to stand long hours daily to withdraw cash, the AG could take no more of Sibal's accusations which echoed the tone of political parties criticising the government in Parliament and outside.    Rohatgi said, ""The statistics being reeled out by Sibal are all wrong. It is for political reasons that these petitioners are raising this issue. Common people have supported the government's decision to demonetise high value currency notes to root out black money.""    When Sibal continued to criticise the Centre, Rohatgi said, ""The government at the highest level is monitoring the situation on a daily basis and taking steps to ease the problems faced by people. The queues have started reducing in length. Mobile cash dispensing vans are being deployed before private hospitals to help patients. But a few continue to use the situation to serve their political ends.""    To drive home the point, the AG said, ""I saw Sibal's press conference (for Congress party) yesterday. It is the same as what he is saying here.""    Sibal replied, ""I have freedom of speech to criticise the government's policy decisions."" The AG said, ""We know what is going on.""

""The RBI step is enough to double farmers' troubles, whereas Modi had assured to double the income of farmers,"" said Jakhar on Friday at Bathinda.

2016-11-19 07:24:00,Little-known film from 1946 brilliantly tells a tale of the first demonetisation,"CHENNAI: When a measure like demonetisation that affects all people comes into play, you can be sure it will be factored into films in a variety of ways in the times to come. Film is a mass medium and a mass happening is certain to find echoes in it. In fact, the very first demonetisation in India that took place in 1946 figures brilliantly in a little known film of the period. The film, `Vijayalakshmi', flopped when it was released, but ironically it is perhaps the only film of 1946 to have survived 70 turbulent years since it saw the light of day.    Though named eponymously after its female protagonist, the film is dominated by the avaricious father-in-law Ganapathi Iyer, who finds his nemesis in the demonetisation of thousand rupee notes. In a superbly crafted climax that is based on superimpositions, unconventional camera angles and evocative music, the character that marries the religiosity of the priestly class with the greed of the loan shark finds superb evocation. Based on a Marathi stage play , `Bandaachi Soon', written by playwright Ganesh Krishna Shastri Pathak, Vijayalakshmi was directed by the veteran filmmaker P Pulliah, most famous for directing N T Rama Rao in the iconic mythological Sri Venkateswara Mahatyam (1960). Ironically , Vijayalakshmi is on the other end of the spectrum, being for most part a delightful vehicle of cinematic realism that presents credible characters and situations.    B R Panthulu, known more as producer director of seminal films like `Veerapandiya Kattabommon', `Kappalottiya Thamizhan', `Karnan' and Aayirathil Oruvan', if not for ` his essay of the role of `School Master', excels himself in a riveting portrayal of greed. With the varied palette of a practised actor, he brings facial expres sions, as well as mannerisms of speech and gait to make the character of the miserly Ganapathi come alive.    After his religiously conducted Lakshmi Puja, which is more a gloating over accumulated riches in his iron safe than any devotion to the goddess of wealth and prosperity , Ganapati Iyer receives a letter from his son Ramu. He begins to utter mournful cries learning that Ramu has resigned his job. Questioned by his wife, he says, `Praanan Poana Enna, Panam Poana Enna, Rendum Onnu thaanedi' (Losing money is akin to losing one's life), underlining his philosophy of life with the skewed equation that wealth equals life.    This immediately leads to exploitation and ill-treatment of women, of course with the complicity of other women, as is to be expected in a patriarchal society with scant respect for the rights or feelings of women. Prodded by his wife, Ganapati Iyer sends his daughter-in law packing to her father's place so that he can make more money getting his son married a second time. "" A two-stringed gold necklace, all the silver ware, and 10,000 as dowry for the second marriage. I can put away another 15,000 rupees in my safe,"" he chuckles happily , gloating over future acquisitions! Note hungry Ganapati is of the kind that invites the woes of demonetisation.    The year 1946 was a challenging one for the film industry with famine conditions prevailing in parts of the then Madras Presidency and the introduction of 12 ounce ration of rice. The demonetisation of 500, 1000 and 10,000 notes also hit the money bags financing the film industry as it did the stars who received part of the payment in black. Though the introduction of prohibition in eight districts of the Presidency made it seem that favourable conditions had been created for the film trade, there was actually little enthusiasm at the box office.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Little-known-film-from-1946-brilliantly-tells-a-tale-of-the-first-demonetisation/articleshow/55506048.cms,

2016-11-19 10:00:00,How ATMs became holy shrines overnight post demonetisation,"MUMBAI: We queue up for hours for darshan. We hope they will bestow on us what we desperately desire, but there’s no guarantees. We trade stories of other sites which might be more bountiful.    We beg their guardians to allow us access. And when we finally succeed they now put a mark, like a tilak, on our finger. Can anyone doubt that banks, and in particular ATM machines, are our new shrines and pilgrimage spots? It is quite a change from when they were first introduced in India, nearly 30 years ago. Citibank and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC) introduced them in Bombay (now Mumbai) in September 1987 on the premises of the banks.    They only accepted cheques and dispensed cash of up to Rs 3,000 a day. An article in the Times of India in August 1987 announcing their impending introduction noted that ATMs could undertake fund transfers and other financial activities abroad but “it is unlikely to be introduced in India in the near future.” And for some time ATMs were “likely to be restricted to big cities only.”    Internationally, ATMs had been introduced exactly 20 years earlier. As with most major technologies, multiple efforts were on around the same time toward making a machine that mechanised basic banking tasks. From the 1950s, vending machines had become popular for dispensing many products in the US, UK, parts of Europe and, in particular Japan, where the 1964 Tokyo Olympics had helped showcase them to the world. There’s some evidence that a cash-dispensing machine was tried there.    But the first functioning ATM is generally agreed to have started on July 27, 1967, in Enfield, a suburb of London. Its inventor John Shepherd-Barron, whose father was the chief engineer of Chittagong port, was born in Shillong in 1925 and was later sent to Britain to be raised. His first job was with De La Rue, the famous specialist printers of banknotes, and he would eventually become managing director of its instruments division.    It is fairly obvious Shepherd-Barron would be inclined toward developing a cash-dispensing machine. But in the story he carefully developed over the years he always presented it as a streak of inspiration that hit him when he was, like Archimedes, lying in his bath. He had been just one minute too late that Saturday to cash a cheque before his bank closed and he wondered why something like a candy vending machine couldn’t be modified to give out cash.    Through De La Rue he knew the management at Barclays bank, and when he presented his idea they readily agreed to support it. Instead of plastic card, Shepherd-Barron’s model used vouchers printed with radioactive ink to help the machine decipher them. (He insisted the ink wasn’t harmful and a user would have to eat 136,000 vouchers before it had an effect.) It required a Personal Identification Number, or PIN. (In another part of the story he always mentioned, he had made six-digit PINs before his wife said she could never remember more than four, and that’s why four-digit PINs are still the norm today.)      Also read:    For many, demonetisation is a step toward equality  Shepherd-Barron ensured he got credited as the inventor of the ATM, but more comprehensive research has shown several other possible claimants. One, Luther George Simjian, actually preceded him with a machine in New York city in 1960, but this only accepted cheques and cash. It only proved popular with prostitutes and gamblers who didn’t want to go into banks. This didn’t help its reputation and it was discontinued.    Just a week after Shepherd-Barron’s machine dispensed its first £10 – which was all it gave out – a Swedish company set up a cash machine. (Sweden would also record perhaps the first major ATM theft when some enterprising criminals found a way to reuse its tokens at multiple machines.) A month later, another British bank started one, and in 1969, machines appeared independently in the UK, US and Japan. While they all used different systems, in time it became apparent that plastic cards with magnetic strips were the most efficient way to access them.    These cards were among the technologies that came together around the same time to make ATMs possible.    Others were visual display units, strong steel cases, telephone networks and, much later on, software like Windows, which is still used in nearly all ATMs. But the technology faced severe problems as well. Few machines at that time were designed to operate round the clock and in the open, working in all-weather situations. Most of those early ATMs crashed continuously.    Yet banks persisted with them. Mechanised banking, if it could be made to work, had many advantages. It seemed cutting-edge, allowing banks to give their rather sedate image a high-tech gloss. In the UK, where unions were pushing to stop Saturday banking, ATMs would be one way to keep operations going, with the added hope that, over time, replacing human tellers could cut the power of the unions. In the US, ATMs were a way to reach out to the around 30% of Americans who still didn’t bank – like India today, the US then still had a substantial population that operated on cash.    Customers were initially less enthusiastic. People are wary of innovation when it comes to their money and stories abounded of ATMs eating up cards and dispensing cash randomly. People were used to operating within banking hours, so the ability to take money out at any time didn’t seem important.    But then they realised how even during banking hours ATMs could cut their waiting time. The ability to transact fast turned out to be as important as the ability to transact at any time. When banks were allowed to open off-branch ATMs, the geographical range of transactions also increased.    Bernardo Batiz-Lazo, a business historian and expert on cash economies, points to one overriding change that ATMs lead to. Before they came, most people thought of banks in relation to the branch they used, where the staff was familiar and trusted. ATMs helped break that link, making people realise that the brand was important, not the branch itself. Banks used this to expand the scope of their activities into other financial services, deploying staff, who would otherwise have been tied to branch banking, elsewhere. Reducing the importance of branches also helped contain real estate costs.  THE TAKEOFF  ATM installation took off toward the end of the 1970s, especially as telephone networks enabled them to be connected in an ever-increasing web.    In the US, their ease of use helped bring the large segment who operated on cash and either had no time for or were wary of bank branches slowly into the formal banking network – very much as is hoped will happen in India. Paul Volcker, one of the most notable governors of the US Federal Reserve, called them “the only useful innovation in banking.”    In India, their takeoff took more time. In 1999, 12 years after their introduction, there were still only around 800 ATMs in the country. But in just a few years, the number would explode, crossing 10,000 in 2003. Even more impressive, as an article in ToI that year noted, the number of daily transactions per ATM had shot up from 50 in 1999 to 140 in 2003, while cash dispensed went up from Rs1,900 crore in 1999 to Rs 57,000 crore in 2003. Slowly but surely India was getting into the ATM habit.    Banks helped by innovating in ATM placements and services. In 2004, the State Bank of India in Kochi launched a floating ATM, on a ferry plying between the jetties of Ernakulam and Vypeen in the city’s huge bay. At the other end of India, SBI set up an ATM at Leh, 16,000 feet above sea level, primarily for the benefit of the armed forces.    The regularity of strikes from the intransigent unions of public sector banks increased demand for the roundthe-clock reliability of ATM services. Banks extended ATM services, offering them in multiple languages, adding bill payment, ticket payment and other financial services. A few even tried offbeat services like giving horoscopes or allowing temple donations.  THE FUTURE  This was, perhaps, a presentiment of the shrine-like status they would take in the chaos following demonetisation. But it remains to be seen if the long-term effect will be to increase or decrease their use. On the one hand, one certain consequence will be to push people from the unaccounted cash only economy to the formal banking system – and cash taking and dispensing ATMs are likely to be the prime point of interaction.    Yet the experience from abroad suggests that ATM usage can also drop off. In the US and Europe, ATM usage seems to be diminishing. According to the American Banking Association, the percentage of customers using ATMs to manage their accounts has declined from 17% in 2009 to 11% last year. Banks say that people now visit ATMs around once every two weeks, down at least once a week. Alternatives like internet and mobile banking are partly responsible for this, but above all it seems driven by a decreasing demand for cash.    Anyone who’s spent time in the US will be familiar with this. Many Americans rarely carry more than $20 with them – a sum that’s enough to take care of most immediate situations, while for anything else card payments will do. In Europe, in countries like Sweden, card payments are so common that cash is now rare, and most often carried by foreigners. In one Scandinavian country a series of muggings of Asians was originally thought to be racist, until the police realised that the criminals were targeting Asians simply because they were more likely to have cash.    Perhaps the one really lasting change from the current chaos in India will be in pushing us not just towards more use of plastic, but more use of plastic for small amounts. Many people with credit or debit cards tended to use them only for substantially large purchases, not least because smaller retailers didn’t have card machines. But the absence of cash in the days post demonetisation has both pushed card holders to use them for small transactions, and retailers to offer the service. One telling sign in a shop said: “Card payments accepted for cigarettes.”    Despite the growth of cards and other payment systems, the market for cash, and ATMs to dispense it, does seem likely to remain strong in India. As experts like Batiz-Lazo point out the ratio of ATMs to population in India is still way below global norms, leaving plenty of scope to expand. Once you leave the metros, ATMs can still seem far too few and remote.    Batiz-Lazo, in an interview with ET, also pointed out that moving to plastic “implies generating fees for the bank and the card company.    So who has more to gain from going cashless?” Once the current chaos dies down, and financially savvy Indian customers start receiving their card statements, the fees and interest rates charged by banks are likely to become a problem. So too will the inevitable stories of people struggling with credit card debt.    Above all, notes Batiz-Lazo, the government, in its enthusiasm to drive people away from cash, and in particular black money, doesn’t seem to respect the very real reasons why people remain faithful to it. “These are not stupid people. They do not want to pay taxes because, among other things, there is little value for them in doing so.”    It’s pointless trying to make India into a cash-free and high-tax country line Sweden because people in Sweden can see the welfare state benefits they get from hightaxes (though this is increasingly in question there too). In India, where people see only crumbling infrastructure and wasteful spending, the reluctance to pay tax can be understood if not entirely condoned. The Modi government is trying to make black money, and demonetisation as a way to tackle it, a moral issue.    But in the long run, especially as the patriotic appeal of demonetisation fades, it makes more sense just to deliver better, more efficient services, giving people a logical reason to pay tax. Until that happens, cash in all its coloured forms will remain dominant in India – and so will ATMs as our mechanised monetary mandirs that mediate our access to it.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/How-ATMs-became-holy-shrines-overnight-post-demonetisation/articleshow/55507453.cms,
2016-11-19 10:08:00,Demonetisation: Analysts warn of speed bumps before GDP growth rebound,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: The scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which comprised about 86% of all cash in circulation, will put a dent in India’s growth. How big is a matter of speculation — some analysts pegged the setback at a few tenths of a percentage point, others slashed estimates by half. The most pessimistic view would possibly see India slipping back behind China and losing its title of fastest growing major economy in the world.    Brace for a slowdown in the remaining five months of FY17 as demand dries up in response to the lack of liquidity, but expect an equally strong rebound in a few quarters when the expected benefits of the move kick in, was the predominant view among analysts.      Also read:    Crisis easing, could not have done better, says Jaitley  “The economy has had a heart attack this quarter,” said Indranil Sen Gupta, chief India economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. “We expect the impact of this to resonate for at least two quarters, impacting GDP by 50 basis points for the fiscal year.”    Most put the revised number at around 7% against earlier estimates of near 8%, an optimism that had been bolstered by good monsoons and a pay commission-led consumption boost. The Indian economy expanded 7.6% in FY16. The International Monetary Fund had put FY17 growth at the same level. China is likely to grow at 6.6% in 2016 and is expected to slow to 6.2% in 2017.    HDFC Bank expects India’s GDP to grow at 7.3% versus the earlier estimate of 7.8%. CARE Ratings slashed its projection for gross value added (GVA) to 7.1-7.3% from 7.6%. Services will get hit the most in the December quarter on account of losses in trade, hotels and transport due to the volume of cash transactions involved in these activities.      Also read:    For many, demonetisation is a step toward equality  “Agriculture is expected to be least impacted with the major shock being absorbed in the first two-three weeks itself as there have been issues in sales at mandis due to the cash crunch presently,” CARE Ratings said in a report.    ICRA cut its growth forecast by 40 basis points. It had earlier forecast GDP and GVA to grow 7.9% and 7.7%, respectively. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.    “Consumption-oriented sectors, particularly those which witness a sizable magnitude of cash transactions, such as real estate, construction, jewellery, retail, travel and tourism and trade are likely to be most affected. Cash-based transactions in the unorganised sector would also get disrupted, particularly in rural areas,” said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA.    Investment bank Ambit Capital took a far bleaker view. It cut GDP growth estimates for FY17 to 3.5% from 6.8% earlier and for FY18 to 5.8% from 7.3%, even penciling in the possibility of a contraction in the ongoing third quarter.      Also read:    How Modi's currency ban turned ATMs into holy shrines overnight  Ambit said the cash crunch will paralyse economic activity in the short term. “Hence, we expect GDP growth to decelerate from 6.4% in the first half of FY17 (as per Ambit estimates) to 0.5% year on year in the second half of FY17 with a distinct possibility of GDP growth contracting in the third quarter FY17.”    An economist at one of the large private Indian banks said GVA growth could be as low as 7.1% with discretionary consumption to suffer a major blow due to the cash crunch. “It will be a drag especially in this quarter but we expect things to normalise in the fourth quarter,” the economist said.    Credit ratings firm Crisil earlier projected GDP to grow 7.5% but now expects a downside risk emanating from demonetisation.    “Though we are still waiting and watching, it is almost certain that demonetisation will shave off some percentage points from the GDP,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings & Research, a Fitch Group company. HSBC expects an impact of up to one percentage point on growth. “Using the cash elasticity of GDP, we estimate that over a year, economic growth can fall by 0.7-1.0 ppt (percentage point), with the maximum impact in the immediate two quarters, which will see a large contraction in ‘effective’ money supply,” it said in a note.    Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said it was too early to assess the impact of demonetisation. “It is too early to assume GDP will go down just because of this. The situation will ease out in next 10 to 15 days,” he said at an ET Now function, while pointing out that things were improving. The deceleration will push the government’s ambitions of achieving 8% growth further out of reach.    “Consumption has been hit hard. Agriculture has done better this year but it will not be able to make up for this impact,” said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. Consumption has about a 56% weightage in GDP.    Sen Gupta said the economy can at best grow at the same pace as last year, though it is more likely it will grow somewhere around 7.4%, slower than the 7.6% registered in the fiscal year ended March 2016. The biggest blow will be borne by services sector as people conserve cash rather than spend on travel, consumption or leisure activities. Since the sector dominates the economy, this will lead to some job losses and pull GDP lower.  BIG BOOST AHEAD  While the short-term view is negative, most experts have a bullish view a year down the line from the boost to taxes and potentially lower interest rates and inflation. Ambit expects a 25-50 basis point reduction in interest rates in the second half of the current fiscal.    “Since government’s fiscal situation is likely to improve (with higher tax collection), GDP growth is likely to improve over time – we expect FY18 GDP growth of around 8.2% (revised up) from 8%,” said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.    Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are also big contributors to GDP, will be hit because both payments and receipts are in cash, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.    “Overall GDP would be affected by 0.3% to 0.5%,” Sabnavis said. Care had expected India’s GDP to grow at 7.8% before the monetisation was announced.    Expectations are that the sowing for the winter rabi crop will also be affected, though it is unclear on what impact the demonetisation will have on prices of foodstuff.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Analysts-warn-of-speed-bumps-before-GDP-growth-rebound/articleshow/55507506.cms,
2016-11-19 10:15:00,"Chamber of commerce and Industry writes to Prime Minister, demands relaxation in demonetisation","RAIPUR: Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) has sent an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Raman Singh, pointing out that the insufficient withdrawal limit from banks fixed by the Centre was causing difficulties to the masses after demonetisation of currency.    Talking to TOI, CCI members said, ""We welcome the move of demonetisation of high-value currency notes as it will put an end to corruption, hit terror funding and counterfeiting.    This will clean up the economy and create a stable base for the rise of economy. But the problems faced by small retailors, grocery store keepers and motel owners must be addressed efficiently in the wake of the decision.""    In wake of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, there has been a sharp drop in number of customers and overall sales across vegetable markets, grocery stores and other commercial establishments due to shortage of tender change in the capital city of Chhattisgarh.    Keeping in view the interest of these retailers, government should allow the usage of demonetised currency just as the defunct currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 is allowed at government hospital and petrol pumps.    Even it should be allowed in private hospitals for the convenience of patients and their family members.    Chamber members also suggested in the letter that to ease the distribution of new currency at banks, post offices and ATMs, the government should extend their distribution counters.    The appropriate counters could be certain government offices and at rural places, counters of chief executive officer at Janpad office could be brought in use.    The members also stated that the traders should not be detained for interrogation on being found with money. For time being, the trading and business in all sectors have faced a setback, which will improve in another six months.    Moreover, the payments of daily wages to small cottage industry workers and labourers have become difiicult and brought mismanagement in the business.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/Chamber-of-commerce-and-Industry-writes-to-Prime-Minister-demands-relaxation-in-demonetisation/articleshow/55507568.cms,raipur
2016-11-19 10:14:00,Demonetisation may prove to be a big problem for Mamata Banerjee-led TMC's funding plans,"NEW DELHI: Minutes after demonetisation of high-denomination currency notes was announced last week, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was up in arms, criticising the move. Her contention: the common man and the poor have been inconvenienced.    That apart, her detractors say the other concern within the Trinamool Congress is a deep-rooted fear of party funds drying up. It’s largely an open secret that regional political parties like TMC depend on small-time traders and other local sources for bulk of their funding largely due absence of large-scale corporate donations.    Mumbai-based Progressive Electoral Trust gave about Rs 1.5 crore to the TMC during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. That was the only corporate contribution to her party, according to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms.    While the TMC’s funding has been a bit of an unanswered riddle, Banerjee claims she raises money for the party through her artistic ventures – the sale of paintings and books.  Also Read: Over Rs 5 trillion deposited in banks  “Someone must be buying her paintings. The question is who and how, is there any transparency?” asked Mohammed Salim, a veteran MP of the CPM.    “This ruling party of Bengal deals with raw cash...That is why, when all national parties are trying to take this issue to Parliament for a proper and serious debate, she is trying to pre-empt it.”    Salim has alleged that the TMC has found a “smarter” way to handle its “unauthorised” funds by depositing them in some banks. “Raiganj District Cooperative bank has received a deposit of Rs 47 crore in four days from November 9 to November 13. How does a poor place like Raiganj get so much of hard cash to deposit in banks in four days?” asked Salim, the MP from Raiganj.    “I have demanded an inquiry into this financial discrepancy and have been assured by people in Delhi that it will be looked into.”    Political observers, however, say the West Bengal CM may stand to gain politically, despite the criticism on her stand against the crackdown on black money.  Also Read: Demonetisation is a big-black scheme: Mamata Banerjee  “The main reason behind Mamata’s hue and cry is her attempt to enter the national space against Modi. From that point of view, it has been a good political move,” said Professor Biswanath Chakrabarty, a political analyst.    “However, Trinamool Congress in popular perception is linked with chit fund scams, black money and syndicate raj. While her populism will gain the confidence of a section of marginalised class, she might lose the trust of educated urban voters.”    West Bengal has become a place where instances of political control over cash rich syndicates and stories of extortion from businesses – mostly small ones – are increasingly coming to the fore.    Rajarhat, on the north-eastern fringes of Kolkata, is a case study. It accounts for over 60% of West Bengal’s real estate sales. This was the region that gave birth to the concept of syndicates and even gave them sanction in the garb of providing jobs. As a result, building material orders had to be ‘mandatorily’ placed with the registered syndicates at prices higher than market rates.    Rajarhat has at least 200 such syndicates, also known as ‘land loser’s cooperatives’. While the street perception is that these syndicates switched their allegiance after the ascent of the TMC in the State, the fact is that Banerjee had to intervene amid complaints of rampant ‘extortion demands’.    “Rajarhat people are telling the country how to run syndicates. If you want to stay in Trinamool Congress, you have to abstain from such extortion rackets and syndicates,” Banerjee told a workers’ meeting.    The Income Tax Department has already zeroed in on some syndicates said to be dealing with unauthorised cash. Jan Dhan accounts, meant to financially empower the weaker sections, are being used by political parties to stash cash, a senior official of the IT department claimed.    At another level, TMC is bracing for another political fight in case the party comes under the scanner of any economic investigations. With Banerjee having raised the pitch already, TMC leader say any such move against the party would be construed an act of political revenge by the Centre.    While condemning demonetisation, she had made the point that her party had received three IT notices earlier.    According to Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice president of the BJP’s Bengal unit, Banerjee is under pressure for two reasons. He said the returns filed by the TMC with the Election Commission in 2012-13 showed the party received donations of Rs 2 crore from two companies that never existed.    “Her vote bank consists of people involved in fake currency note rackets, cattle smuggling and bomb making. So, they are creating pressure on her to get the Centre’s decision reversed,” he said.    Central intelligence agencies, meanwhile, have filed reports with the Home Ministry that Banerjee’s attack against Modi was aimed at leveraging the frustration of people who were inconvenienced. These agencies are also trying to locate the roots of TMC’s funding.    Of late, the enforcement agencies have also become cautious. After two TMC MPs were summoned by the Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the Saradha chit-fund case, Banerjee made a huge issue, calling it ‘political vendetta’.    TMC leaders are tight-lipped about the party’s funding and the impact of demonetisation on the party. “Banerjee has always reacted sentimentally when she sees common people in trouble. This is the only reason behind her outrage,” said Subrata Mukherjee, a senior minister.    According to a party member in the ranks, unlike frontline political parties, the TMC does not have central coffers and its funds are kept with various leaders.    “We have accounts in districts and panchayat areas where we keep our party funds. Now we are waiting for directions from our leader or our general secretary. They will take the final call about cash deposits,” the party member said.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-may-prove-to-be-a-big-problem-for-Mamata-Banerjee-led-TMCs-funding-plans/articleshow/55507575.cms,

Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president Ripun Bora told TOI on Friday that demonetization had resulted in immense suffering for the people.    ""Demonetization has definitely affected the bypoll. Due to the currency crisis, some of the candidates could not even spend the money fixed by the Election Commission,"" said Bora.    As many ATMs in Lakhimpur district remained closed, prospective voters looked visibly upset.    ""Lakhimpur's economy is largely dependent on agriculture. Many families in the district have been badly affected as this is the paddy harvesting season and there is no money to pay the labourers. Some voters of Lakhimpur who live in Guwahati and other towns will not be able to come to vote this time as they don't have the money to travel,"" said Hemanta Gogoi, a resident.    Labaram Chetia, a trader in Lakhimpur, said arranging campaign meetings was difficult in this election as people in Lakhimpur town use cash as the most preferred mode of payment. ""Let's wait for the verdict on demonetization,"" he added.    ""We will win Lakhimpur. The seat was represented by Sarbananda Sonowal till he became the chief minister this year.

2016-11-19 10:16:00,"For many, demonetisation is a step towards equality","Mumbai: The common man is inconvenienced, but demonetisation isn’t bringing only brickbats for the government. Compliments are flowing in as well, from those who see gains from the pain. For many, notably the salaried who are seen among the most tax-compliant in the society, demonetisation makes people more equal, because black money that it is seeking to tackle is one of the main causes for the wide inequality in the society.    Low inflation, more affordable real estate and an outside possibility of lower tax rates as the net could become wider are among the fruits that they hope to reap in the long run.    “For the first time, I feel happy for not having more wealth,” said Shajala Borde (name changed), a 40-year-old Mumbai school teacher. She is agitated at her employer, who she says has wades of unaccounted cash.    How does the common man define black money?    ET interacted with a dozen salaried people across the country. The awareness level is high, but subject to some technical definitions. Any “large sum” (in fact, even a single untaxed rupee is black money) that is undisclosed to the tax authorities, said some of the people ET spoke to.    It can be sourced through smuggling, acts of corruption and by other illegal means, and used to fund terrorists, jewellers, builders and politicians. Most people are aware of the parallel economy, which is run on black money spoiling the prospect of the country’s true economic growth.    Many hope demonetisation to leave a big dent on it, no concrete data is available about the size of this shadow economy — estimates range from 10% to as much as 40% of GDP.    U Nandi, an IT engineer who earns close to Rs 2 lakh a month from his job at a multinational company, said the pain is worth it.    “When we, the tax-compliant community, struggle in life earning our livelihood, some crooks get easy money with no tax obligation,” said the 37-year-old. “It is tough to bear such a yawning disparity.”    Nandi said it made him angry when he saw a small roadside tea-snack seller in Chennai’s Ramapuram, a service hub, earning in lakhs every month, but not paying a single rupee of tax.    “The PM has made me feel the taste of hard earned money, for the first time,” said SK Jain, 49, a senior manager at an air conditioner company in Mumbai. He earns about Rs 1.5 lakh a month.    For many salaried people such as Jain and Nandi, small sacrifices like standing in a queue to withdraw money do not matter in the large scheme of things. Neither do they mind going to a departmental store, where they can pay by card, to buy milk, instead of the kirana shop. Most of them expect the situation to ease soon.    But they do expect problems if it doesn’t before the next salary cycle starts on December 1, when the need for cash increases, to pay off monthly bills such as maid salaries, school fees and newspaper bill. Tempers do rise where there is an urgent need of cash but they can’t get it due to the curbs.    In Mumbai, Dhiraj Namdev, 34, was seen arguing with a bank manager as he was in dire need of money due to a personal emergency. But, his appearance was deceptive.    “I will fight difficulties for next 30 days as the evil of black money has impacted the country over 30-years,” he said.    The salaried people who pay their tax are the least worried about the demonetisation, beyond the current inconvenience from the cash crunch.    “People who are unable to validate their source of income will of course, be justifiably worried,” said KV Karthik, partner-financial advisory services at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India, Meanwhile, a sense of citizenship duties has started prevailing with some deciding to file income tax returns and stop transactions through black money.    According to Archit Gupta, founder & CEO at ClearTax, an online tax preparation and filing platform, he is receiving many queries now on how to file income tax. “These people include private tutors, gym owners, yoga teachers, beauty parlour owners, who have all earned legitimate money running in few lakhs.”",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/For-many-demonetisation-is-a-step-towards-equality/articleshow/55507609.cms,

2016-11-20 00:05:00,"Demonetisation blues send businessmen, surgeons, ministers to shrinks","DEHRADUN: In Dehradun, it is not just banks and ATMs that people are queuing at. After demonetisation even psychiatric clinics and hospitals have seen a surge in those seeking medical help. The scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes has sent several anxiety-ridden businessmen, top surgeons and at least two state government ministers knocking on the doors of psychologists in the city.    In the past few days, mental health practitioners have had to deal with several cases of anxiety and panic attacks primarily among the business community in Dehradun, with over 10 leading businessmen being hospitalised. A leading city-based psychologist on condition of anonymity told TOI that two state ministers were also undergoing counselling sessions in his clinic after the demonetisation announcement. ""The two ministers panicked and came to me after the announcement, seeking treatment for anxiety. At present, they are undergoing counselling to retain their peace of mind. Such patients need to be treated, otherwise they could suffer trauma,"" he said.    Unable to cope with the stress, some surgeons in the state have suspended their practice for a while and are themselves seeking treatment for anxiety and depression. ""Many of the patients that we have treated in the past few days are either worried about the slump in their business due to cash crunch or do not know how to handle the cash reserves they have,"" clinical psychologist Dr Mukul Sharma said.    Dr Praveen Panwar at Government Doon Medical College said, ""In most such cases that we have seen in the past few days the reason for patients' anxiety was the unaccounted money in their possession. These patients were referred to a clinical psychologist as they were unable to deal with the problem.""    Sharma, however, added that it would be wrong to assume that all those who are experiencing anxiety, depression and other symptoms are black money hoarders. ""People are in general worried about how to exchange their old currency for new notes. Some said that they have wads of cash they had saved through the years which was now worthless,"" he added.    Clinical psychologist Dr Veena Krishnan added, ""Many patients that I have seen in the past week have reported heart palpitations, loss of appetite and anxiety after the demonetisation."" The mental health practitioners said that most of the patients belong to the age group of 40 to 50 years and the symptoms reported by them include sleeplessness, nausea, restlessness and headache. Dr Ravi Gupta, somnologist, Jolly Grant Hospital, said that in the past 10 days he has received many calls from people plagued by insomnia.    In some cases, wives troubled by their spouses' stash of cash have approached psychologists for help. TOI spoke to the daughter of one such patient. She said, ""At first my mother started breaking household items and then she ran out on the streets screaming and pulling out her hair. We were terrified and had to take her to a hospital. She is now undergoing stress management and counselling sessions.""

Saying that he had no reservations about the PM's efforts to rid the economy of black money , Rao impressed upon Modi that all CMs should be taken on board to achieve the desired results.    Chandrasekhar Rao is the first CM that the Prime Minister has met with since the announcement of demonetisation of '500 and `1,000 notes.The Telangana CM, who was in Delhi at Modi's invitation, spent a little more than 50 minutes with the PM to discuss the fallout of withdrawal of high-value currency .    Stressing on the need for immediate relief to states, KCR requested PM to announce financial assistance to compensate the `revenue loss' incurred due to demonetization. He said since the demo netization announcement, Telangana has `1,200 crore in revenue and asked for deferment of loan and interest payments to the Centre by at least six months. During the meeting with the PM, Rao pointed that common people, farmers, small traders and workers in the unorganized sector were badly hit due to the shortage of currency . Lack of adequate `500 notes has further deepened the crisis.    ""After the meeting, the chief minister looked jubilant and remarked it was fruitful. Both leaders discussed the demonetization issue and shared information.The chief minister listed out 10 immediate measures that are needed to be taken to lessen hardships being faced by the common people,"" a highly-placed source said.    PM expressed confidence that the currency crisis would ease once more notes are despatched to banks, the source added.

2016-11-20 07:42:00,Truckers fear 40% loss due to demonetisation bump,"NEW DELHI/BAREILLY: Utilisation of country's nearly 85 lakh trucks is down by almost 40% since demonetisation of high value currency notes was announced, according to industry watchers. While truckers' associations claim that about 60% of trucks plying on roads have been impacted due to cash crunch, experts say the huge fall in cargo movement has impacted the industry .    The government has started assessing what is the extent of the problem and whether it will get bigger in the coming days. In India, the cargo transport share of roads is about 70%, and hence, fall in number of trucks moving on the roads is seen as a bad sign for the economy . Member of the Akhil Gujarat Truck Transport Association, Mukesh Dave said, ""It will not be wrong to say 40% of earnings have been lost. Truckers are now afraid to venture out, fearing that they might be indefinitely stuck in the absence of a steady cash flow. For long distance truckloads, the turnaround time is 12-14 days. "" Though NHAI has suspended toll collection till next Wednesday midnight, rough estimates suggest the truck traffic has reduced by at least 20%. National highways are largely used by long-haul trips and for interstate trips by trucks. Secretary of south zone, AIMTC, G R Shamugappa said that some provision for daily expenses of truck drivers would help. ""We appreciate the fact that there has been some relaxation in the form of free passage at toll gates and banned currencies being accepted at filling stations. However, there is no clarity on how the transporters and truck drivers would manage their daily expenses during trips."" President of All India Motor Transport Congress Bhim Wadhwa said situation was getting worse day by day for truckers. He said Rs 50,000 withdrawal in a week was too less to run even five trucks.On Friday , transport unions during their interaction with FM Arun Jaitley urged the government to raise it to Rs 5 lakh. ""Government must understand this trade runs on cash,"" Wadhwa said.    Meanwhile, trucking industry watcher S P Singh of IFTRT, a Delhi-based think tank, claimed that relaxation in accepting old currency at diesel filling stations was being openly abused to convert black money into white by transport agents by using truckers as foot soldiers. ""The common carriers and transport intermediaries are more busy in seeking extension for cash acceptance of Rs 1,000 and 550 notes, toll exemption, higher cash withdrawal limit on exaggerated claims and so called difficulties,"" he said.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Truckers-fear-40-loss-due-to-demonetisation-bump/articleshow/55520394.cms,

2016-11-20 09:43:00,"Demonetisation: United in faith, divided by cash","CHENNAI: With the turn in tides after last week's demonetisation, the tithes too are in flux at Chennai's churches.    While the Sunday offertory amount has more than doubled in churches populated by people from high income groups, at parishes in poorer neighbourhoods, parishioners who usually tithe or give one-tenth of their income to the church during the first two weeks of the month, have begun cutting back on their offerings. At St Teresa's Church in Nungambakkam, considered a parish of the posh, the inflow into the offertory last Sunday hit an all-time high of `4 lakh, most of it in `500 and `1000 notes. At the other end, in a Valasaravakkam parish, po pulated by those from poorer neighbourhoods, Sunday collections were at `1,500 --the lowest ever --with the priest even opening up boxes and handing out notes to help members in dire straits.    ""We were very surprised when we counted the offertory money , the Sunday after the demonetisation announcement,"" says Rev Fr Stanley Sebastian of St Teresa's Church. ""Our Sunday offertory is usually around `1.5 lakh but that week, it was `4 lakh. Most of the offertory was in `500 and `1000 notes. And when we were noting down the serial numbers, which is required by banks now to deposit these notes, we found most were in sequential order. So they clearly came from the same bundles,"" he adds.    Owing to its central location, old world ambience and ample parking space, St Teresa's Church, says Fr Sebastian, has Catholics from all over the city coming for the Sunday service. ""The congregation is cosmopolitan with several businessmen and professionals choosing to worship here. I would assume that is why the offertory has doubled after the demonetisation drive,"" he says.    At Little Flower Syromalabar Catholic Church in Valsaravakkam though, demonetisation has rendered it more desolate. With the parish members mostly from the lower income group, offertory amounts have dipped by more than half. The offertory, which usually got around `5,000 a week, received only `2000 last Sunday , says Fr Sojo Kannampuzha. ""In fact, I am trying to help parish members who don't have any money by giving them lower denomination notes and telling them they can give it back to the church later. The people need it more now,"" says Fr Sojo. ""I don't have much to give, but am helping whoever I can,"" he says, and adds that despite most parishioners being from the lower income group, he sees a few hundred rupee notes in the offertory box every week, especially at the beginning of the month. ""Last week, there not even one hundred rupee note. It was mostly tens,"" Fr Sojo Kannampuzha adds.    But for Fr Sebastian of St Teresa's Church, the problem is over dealing with the cash, ""Since most of the offertory is in tender that is no longer legal, I had to consult with the church auditor to make sure it would not be a problem to still accept them. I'm glad it is not, because this money can be put to good use for the church,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Demonetisation-United-in-faith-divided-by-cash/articleshow/55521240.cms,chennai
2016-11-21 03:54:00,Demonetization hampers stadium revamp work?,"NAVI MUMBAI: Renovation work of NMMC-run Rajiv Gandhi stadium has been disrupted. If NMMC officials are to be believed, demonetization has caused this stoppage. However, sources said work was suspended from October 27, much before higher denomination notes were banned.    Now, this may delay completion of the Rs 1.85-crore renovation project. Work was be completed by March 2017.    Going by the ground status, it may not meet the deadline since a major portion of work is still pending.    Mohan Dagaonkar, city engineer, told TOI, ""Cash crunch since demonetization has led to the work being halted. The contractor found it challenging to pay daily wages to the labourers. This has forced the contractor to take a brief break.""    However, many term this a face-saver. Sources said, ""Stadium work was discontinued from October 27, as relevant work was yet to be verified by the architect. There's some problem in the scope of work, which delayed the process resulting in a halt."" Locals even alleged that there was no need for renovation work at such a high cost as the existing outfield was good enough.    To pave way for the revamp, NMMC suspended its athletics, cricket and sports nursery activities, depriving over 200 underprivileged students, since January this year. Seventy cricketers, 50 athletes and 40 young kids that were being training under the NMMC sports scheme have been left in the lurch after the stadium was taken up for renovation.    ""No alternative arrangement was made for students to continue training,"" said Vikas Satam, cricket coach.    ""Apart from digging the outfield, nothing has been done so far,"" said a local resident Hemant Gaikwad.

2016-11-21 06:14:00,Demonetisation a double whammy for Sivakasi cracker units,"MADURAI: It's been about 20 days since Diwali celebrations got over, but Sivakasi's cracker industry - the fireworks hub of the country - is yet to resume full-fledged production. If it was the freaky weather which played spoilsport first, it is demonetisation that is wreaking havoc now.    Working at a feverish pace before Diwali, the industry usually takes a week-long break. The production resumes once the northeast monsoon ends, usually around this time, but most fireworks units are yet to get back to work. While mist, haze and delayed monsoon ensured that the labour-intensive sector remained indoors, demonetisation of high-value currency notes has hit business hard.    Most manufacturers did open their factories by the first week of November and carry out symbolic rituals for commencing production. However, once demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 notes was announced, most of the units suspended their activities. In addition to procuring raw materials, wage is an important component of the industry, according to manufacturers. At least 100 people work in a medium size industry and there are more than 700 fireworks manufacturing units in Sivakasi. ""A typical unit may need 10 lakh a week to manage wages and meet expenditure. With so much of restrictions to withdraw cash, it is difficult to mobilise such volume of money,"" said T Kannan, president of The Indian Fireworks Manufacturers Association (TIFMA).    Post-Diwali, Kerala market is important for the industry as fireworks are sold for Christmas celebrations in the state. The momentum would continue till Vishu festival but they are not able to start the production, Kannan said.    Another important factor which has put the manufacturers in a spot is the delayed monsoon and lack of bright sunlight. ""We need dry climate for fireworks production but the weather has not been conducive to commence production as of now,"" said G Abiruben, former president of Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association in Sivakasi.    In Sivakasi, workers are paid wages based on their skill. Those with nimble fingers to make crackers may get higher wages, pointed out M Mahalakshmi, district secretary of Fireworks Workers Association. ""Weather is another factor affecting fireworks production. We have been calling for a support system for workers when there is no work in the units,"" she said. Without adequate wages, it is difficult for hundreds of families to manage their daily expenses, she pointed out.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/Demonetisation-a-double-whammy-for-Sivakasi-cracker-units/articleshow/55531458.cms,madurai

2016-11-21 06:12:00,"Demonetisation: Jatavs, Jats toe party lines","Asra village, Hapur district: It would be fair to say that Hiralal Bhind wal's family is on the right side of rural comfort. In their 12 bighas of land, they grow sugarcane, paddy and vegetables. In another avatar as sharecroppers for an absentee upper caste family , they cultivate an extra 175 bighas.That his mother is the village pradhan further adds to this Dalit family's clout.    But like many others in these parts of western Uttar Pradesh, Hiralal's pull hasn't helped him find a solution to the problem of currency shortage these days. ""The paddy has been harvested. The sugarcane is being cropped. Now we need money to pay our farmhands and buy seeds for wheat and peas. Sowing is already delayed by over a week,"" says the 26-year-old post graduate stu dent, who has been unable to cash a Rs 5,200 cheque. The nearest bank is 10 km away in Hapur, a town famous for its ghee and heeng (asafetida) mandis.    Jagbir Singh, a farmer with 15 bighas of land from the same village, has a similar predicament. He too is unable to pay off the farmhands ever since the Narendra Modi government decided to dump the old series of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.    But the similarities between the two villagers end there.Hiralal is vocal about the eco nomic disruption. But Jagbir and his kinsfolk view the move through an alternate prism. ""We know it is aimed against those with loads of black money . It will also stop terror funding. If you need to bring change, you should be prepared to suffer,"" says Jagbir's relative Dheeraj, an arts graduate student. Jagbir nods in agreement.    Hiralal is a Jatav by caste.Jagbir and Dheeraj are Jats.And talking to several members from both communities in this Dalit-majority villa ge, one gets the impression that for all the fury and helplessness it has generated, demonetisation has also firmed up existing identities and political choices rather than bring radical shifts in political positions. People seem to be making their argument to justify their choices, not the other way around.    In Asra, the Jatavs are firmly with the BSP and the Jats agree with the BJP-led NDA government's move. The sentiment among Jats is: True, the move has caused us some trouble but it is okay because it helps all of us in the long run.The sentiment among the Jatavs is: The move might be well intentioned but it causing a lot of misery to people. In any case, we are with Mayawati.    As per 2011 census, Asra has 58.39% SC population.Jatavs are the single largest caste; the Jats a distant second. The village has 69.92% literacy . Several Jatavs here are landowners. Quite a few are small-time businessmen, junior engineers, railway employees and cops. Ma ny are thankful to Mayawati's earlier regime as UP CM for the change in their lives.They live in decent homes with dish tv and water tanks.    Demonetisation has upset the rhythm of their businesses, they say . Omkar Singh, a Jatav, said his surgical beltmanufacturing business has suffered because everyone associated with the trade is asking for the new notes. Ankit Kumar, who collects and supplies milk to a Mother Diary plant in Kuchesar about 12 kms away , has been unable to withdraw money . ""I went to stand in the queue at 5.30 am; what do I do?,"" he asks.    On the same problem, the Jats, who live by the busy road that runs through the village, offer a different perspective.Hem Singh, who owns 30 bighas of land, says that ""a villager is used to standing in queue to buy fertiliser and pay electricity bills."" For him, the bigger issue is not receiving full payment for last year's sugarcane produce from the UP government. Dhanpal Singh cannot understand what the fuss is about. ""I just filled up the tanks of my two cars and tractor to spend my old curren cy. Mazdoor aur kisan ke liye koi samasya nahi hai,"" he says. Rameshwati, whose son is getting married next month, admits that the notes shortage has raised her anxiety levels.""But I am not blaming Modiji,"" she says, ""the move is good.""    She cannot read or write. ""But that's I have heard in family discussions,"" she says.    Compared to cities like Delhi, there is less cynicism about the economic measure.Right or wrong, the general feeling is that the step is meant to benefit the honest in the long run. Pramod Kumar, a gaderiya (shepherd) by caste and owner of 15 bighas of land says ""mehengai rookegi aur chor pakde jayenge"".    The Uttar Pradesh state election dates are yet to be announced. But the poll campaign has already started.On the way to Asra, one notices battery carts and cars in campaign mode for the BJP and the SP. And the local BSP MLA visited Asra last Friday .

2016-11-21 06:33:00,Demonetisation worsens state's financial crisis,"HYDERABAD: Even as the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) was gearing up to organize celebrations to mark its two-and-ahalf year-long power on a megascale demonetization of ` 500 and `1,000 currency notes, it seems to have dealt a body blow to nascent Telangana State, pushing its finances deeper into turmoil.    Though CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has chosen to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this unprecedented decision, he is apparently worried about the negative fall-out of demonetization on the state's finances in the current financial year and its negative spell on budgetary resources for the next financial year.    Chandrasekhar Rao was the first chief mini ster to take stock of the situation following the demonetization of high-value currency notes on 8th November. He has been conferring with the state officials to assess the impact of this crucial decision on the state's fragile finances as well as on the general public. He air-dashed to New Delhi with a dossier on the effects of demonetization on various sections of people as well as different sectors of the economy, including the state's finances, which are already in a precarious condition.    He called on the PM with a slew of demands to lessen the woes of people who are adversely hit by cash crunch imposed by the cancellation of high-denomination notes.    He has also sought additional grants from the Union government to compensate the state for loss of its revenue on account of this financial upheaval.    With all segments of trade and markets coming to a nearstandstill due to the cash crunch, the State's Own Tax Revenues have taken a direct hit.    Bulk of Telangana's tax revenue comes from VAT and other taxes on trade, state excise, stamps and registration, motor vehicle tax etc. These have fallen to a trickle since November 9.Non-tax revenue from mining and other sources, including `10,900 crore targeted from sale of lands, have taken a plunge. To add to the state's financial woes, the Union government is also likely to curtail the releases to the state on account of share in central taxes and grants-in-aid, as its own financial position re mains critical. The resource crunch in the five-month period (November 2016March 2017) is likely to significantly curtail the state's non-plan expenditure and the plan outlay, more so the capital expenditure. The sectors or schemes expec ted to be severely affected are major and medium irrigation, Mission Kakatiya, Mission Bhagiratha, roads and buildings, housing, social welfare schemes such as Aasara pensions, Shaadi Mubarak and Kalyana Lakshmi, pre and post-matric scholarships and fees reimbursement, partial waiver of farm loans, power subsidy for farm sector, release of funds for panchayat raj and urban local bodies, interest payments and servicing of debts, etc.    The revenue will be just enough to pay salaries, allowances and pensions of government employees. For the third financial year in a row, since the formation of Telangana in 2014, the state government has been facing an unenviable financial position. Drought in the previous two years and flash floods in the current year have impacted the state's economy. Demonetisation has compounded the woes.    The state came up with a budget of `100,638 crore for the 10month period of 2014-15, the actual expenditure worked out to ` 62,306 crore. In 2015-16, the state unveiled a budget of `115,689 crore but the expenditure booked was ` 90,818 crore. In the current year, 2016-17, the finance minister presented a budget of `130,416 crore but the expenditure in the first six months (AprilSeptember 1016) has aggregated to just ` 49,594 crore. The state may close the financial year with a total expenditure of around Rs one lakh crore.

In an unusual development, a 40-year-old director of a hospital is struggling to procure bail so that he could exchange his stock of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes lying at his home. The inmate is embroiled in an allegation of immoral trafficking. Earlier, he had applied for bail on two occasions: first one was rejected and the second time he withdrew his bail application from Gujarat High Court fearing his plea could be rejected once again. On Friday, he submitted a bail application for the third time at the Gandhinagar court.Adalaj police said, ""Naroda resident Bharat Mali, 40, is a Director at Swapna Srushti Multi-specialty Hospital in Krushnanagar, Nava Naroda. He lives with his wife and son. He has been accused by a Pune woman of pushing her into illegal trafficking. She has accused Mali of calling her to Ahmedabad under the pretext of getting her work but later pushed her into immoral trafficking."" Based on the complaint, Adalaj police arrested him on October 21. He was booked under IPC Section 323 and later sent to Sabarmati Central Jail. Mali, who resides in a bungalow in Nava Naroda and owns two cars, had applied for bail on October 26 but his plea was rejected.An inmate can procure bail before a charge sheet is filed within the stipulated 90 days by the police. However, the discretion of granting the bail lies with the court. An inmate can get the default bail after the charge sheet is filed, under the Indian Penal Code. However, looking at demonetisation, Mali is eager to get bail before the charge sheet is filed. Bharat Mali's lawyer Jagat Patel told Mirror, ""Bharat is a Director in a 25-bed private hospital which was established in September 2015. He has been filing income tax returns since 2001. He should be allowed bail so that he could exchange old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes like any other citizen.""Patel added, ""My client wants temporary bail. If we wait for the charge sheet, it would be too late. By then, the deadline of depositing and exchanging old currency would lapse and my client will incur financial loss.""

The place is better known for frequent tremors attributed to Koyna dam, among the state's big gest irrigation projects.All that the 42 villages, located in a quake-prone area around the dam, have is a solitary 'cashless' Bank of Maharashtra branch with three employees and no ATM. Life in Koynanagar town and the surrounding villages has almost come to a standstill due to the cash crunch.The branch began issuing cash only in the last few days.People have to travel 20-30 km to exchange their notes and withdraw money , an exasperation in itself because of the frequent need to catch public and private transport to reach from the nearby towns of Patan and Malharpeth.Not much help is coming as villagers describe the situation as worse than the tremors they have now become used to ever since the dam was constructed in 1962. Till date, about 22 tremors of magnitude 5 and above, 200 of the magnitude 4 and above, and several thousand smaller tremblors have occurred in the region.The 6.3 magnitude Koyna earthquake in 1967 is the largest reservoir triggered earthquake in the world.""After earthquakes, the government comes to our rescue. But when the government creates a tremor, who will help us?"" Kshama Chougule said. She has walked about 4km from her hamlet to open a bank account. With an old Rs 500 note she requests those standing in the line to fill a form.""I don't have enough money to deposit in the bank and never thought of opening a bank account. But now, nobody is accepting this note and I need an account to get it exchanged,"" she said, adding that she doesn't think that she will operate her account once she gets the note exchanged.Sitaram Kadam knows the importance of disaster management having lived in this zone. ""I don't think the government gave a thought to the economic disaster before scrapping these two currency notes.Here in Koynanagar we are always prepared for tremors and our rescue systems are in place. Even while building houses, we use tin roofing and not concrete slabs. There are no multistoried buildings. We pre pare for disaster and keep rescue measures ready. We don't complain about the demonetisation, but the government didn't think about the consequences and what will happen to people like us,"" Kadam, a hotel owner at a bus stop, said. He has been waiting for customers for the entire day since his business came to naught after demonetisation.Across the road, as the crowd swelled inside the bank with dilapidated walls and a tin roof, the branch manager is eating his lunch.People restlessly mill around as the person at the counter issuing new currency notes goes for a tea break.""The bank has not issued money since November 9. We were told that they have no currency. When the cash arrived, the server was down as monkeys destabilized the internet antenna.My wife is ailing and I have no money. I have been queuing up here for the last 10 days,"" R L Gandhare, an employee at Koyna dam division, said, his voice growing shriller for the bank manager to hear.He returned from lunch, and did not give his name and murmured, ""We are helpless. We distribute money as and when we get it. We are four persons in this branch, but one is always on leave,"" he said, burying his head in a sheaf of papers.As crowd grew impatient, the employee who had gone for a tea break came back and switched off the lights.""Cash is over. Come on Monday,"" he said even as customers shouted at the employees who silently packed their lunch boxes and relaxed in their chairs.Local journalist Vijay Lad said the aftershocks of demonetization have completely rattled the local market economy and agriculture. ""The markets are empty and farmers are sitting empty handed. Agriculture and tourism are two main activities that keep the economy going. But today, both are adversely affected.We can't do anything to improve the situation, but just wait for things to turn normal,"" he said, adding that the voice and the woes of the masses in remote areas have not reached Prime Minister or his Cabinet.""The government wants us to keep calm for 50 days.We have been calm for the last 50 years since the dam was built. Our forefathers who gave up land for the dam were promised quality life. The entire state is getting electricity from the hydel project on this dam, but see what has happened to our lives,"" an agitated hawker selling bananas on the main road to Koynanagar said.When asked for his name, he reacted defensively. ""What you will do with my name? We are the nameless and faceless people who suffer -be it an earthquake or the scrapping of big currency notes,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Demonetisation-aftershocks-rattle-Koynanagar-residents/articleshow/55533456.cms,pune
2016-11-21 09:28:00,Demonetisation: Cash-less buyers force brands to offer freebies,"BENGALURU | NEW DELHI: Those who thought the big discounts and sales had ended with Diwali are in for a surprise: demonetisation has resulted in retailers offering out-of-season rebates and incentives to lure customers back. Fashion brands are going the ecommerce way after the invalidation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, offering promotions, cashbacks and discounts during the full-price season to reverse a trend of dwindling sales and fewer footfalls and save the October-December quarter from becoming a washout.    ""Post Diwali, we don’t run promotions. But when suddenly 40% of the customer base disappears, then what do we do?"" asked Kavindra Mishra, managing director of Pepe Jeans.      Also Read:    Cash crunch likely to take turn for better, ATM withdrawal limit may be raised from Rs 2,500  While stores take a leaf out of the typical ecommerce strategy of cashbacks, online retailers have substantially increased discounts for customers using cards. Myntra is offering an additional 25% discount on purchases above Rs 1,299 paid through debit and credit cards and Jabong has the same benefit for online payments of Rs 999 and more.    ""The discount is being offered to encourage people to use cards,"" a spokesperson for Bengaluru-based Myntra said in an emailed response. ""The offer was started on November 9 and has seen a good response with prepaid transactions increasing by 30%.""    While Tommy Hilfiger and Benetton are offering promotions, Superdry and Marks & Spencer are trying to draw customers with discounts and cashbacks. Pepe Jeans has gone a step ahead by giving additional discounts on card transactions. Marks & Spencer has an additional 10% cashback on card payments and Pepe Jeans offers 5% off.    Yogeshwar Sharma, executive director at Select CityWalk Mall in New Delhi, said cards are used for almost 98% of the purchases at the shopping centre, although he did not say if footfalls and sales have been affected in recent weeks. Retailers said the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes 10 days after Diwali came as a blow, especially when they typically sell products at full prices. Pepe said it started on-the-spot cash incentives for in-store staff for higher conversions and this seems to have arrested the decline in sales to 26% from 50% a week earlier. Superdry said its promotions helped it to stem the sales drop to about 20% from 40-50% earlier.    ""This situation is going to be there till the end of this month. However, we are re-analysing the consumption pattern every week,"" said Manu Sharma, business head of Superdry at Reliance Brands.    Not all brands are resorting to discounts — some are offering customers other services and incentives. Sports brand Puma is accepting cheques from loyal customers. However, such measures appear to have a limited impact. Overall, business hasn’t improved as fewer customers are spending money after the high-denomination notes were scrapped.    ""These steps (discounting and cashback) are to overcome the customer’s negative sentiment. But it hasn’t helped. Between last week’s footfalls and sales numbers and now, there isn’t much change,"" said Suresh Singaravelu, executive director of retail at Prestige Estates Projects, which owns South India Forum malls and Bengaluru’s luxury mall UB City.    Last week, he told ET that footfalls at the Prestige malls had dropped 20% on the weekend while sales at the food courts fell 40%, fashion categories sales declined 25% and hypermarket sales were 30% lower.    ""Business is still down by 50-70%. It has not picked up,"" said Suhail Yusuff, secretary of the Brigade Road Shops and Establishments’ Association in Bengaluru, which is home to national and international brands such as Arrow, Nike, Puma, Adidas and Vero Moda. The sudden, major dent in consumer sentiment has resulted in inventory piling up with retailers and they are now trying to liquidate the stockpiles by advancing the December end-season sale.    ""The end-of-season sale period starts from the last week of December, but this year almost all brands are planning to bring it forward to the first or second week of December,"" said a top executive of a foreign footwear brand.    ""Nobody wants to spend cash and the inventories are piling up. Hence, we are also planning to advance our sales by a week,"" he added.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Cash-less-buyers-force-brands-to-offer-freebies/articleshow/55534665.cms,
2016-11-21 09:24:00,Demonetization will weed out fly-by-night developers,"PANAJI: The real estate sector welcomed the Union government's decision to put the brakes on black money and confirmed that the move would go a long way in cleaning up the real estate industry. Pointing out that the real estate sector is often identified with black money, CREDAI vice-president Pune Rohit Gera said that the demonetization move would weed out unscrupulous real estate developers.    How does the real estate sector view the move to demonetize high-denomination notes?    I think it is a fabulous move. Most cash goes into buying land or for corruption. I don't believe that organized developers out of choice want to engage in black money. Once you have grown to a professional organization, the disruption that takes place for your business with tax queries is just too much, so professional developers should and will welcome this.    What impact do you see on the real estate sector?    People are certainly looking at deferring their purchase decisions because of the uncertainty and there is uncertainty as far as the real estate sector is concerned. But I think this is temporary. It is going to affect people who are used to dealing with cash.    How long do you expect customers to stay away from the market?    It will not take more than two months to settle. Most homes are being sold in the affordable segment. There is a need for homes.    Do you foresee a drop in prices in the real estate sector?    There is going to be pressure to drop prices and there will be pressure on prices to rise. There is a tug-of-war taking place. In the medium term, prices will rise. For three years prices have not risen and actually fallen and in real terms, prices are down substantially. If you factor that in, where is the room for prices to go down?    Owning a home is no longer within the common man's means. Where is the affordable housing?    Land costs you between 30-50% of your selling price. Taxes today is nearly 35% and 25% is construction cost and the remaining is your profit. Land and Tax accounts for 60-80% of the costs and unless these two come down, how are you going to bring prices down?    What percentage of Goa's real estate sector functions on black money? What will be the impact on this segment?    I don't think more than 15-20% of the purchases are in cash. There are developers and I will not call them developers but fly-by-night operators who build buildings without approvals, without permissions, without paying the corporations and sell most of it in cash. These operators must get weeded out or they must become regular professionals and enter the formal sector. Those who thrive in the cash economy, they are gone for one-and-a-half years.    What should someone, looking for a first home, do in this market?    There is tremendous demand at the bottom of the pyramid. Do a thorough check on the developer's track record. Go and see if work is on at the site and if it is in its early stage. Get the papers checked yourself. If the project has progressed and there is unsold inventory then logic says that something is going to happen. If the project is in its early stage but mostly sold, and has a good track record, go ahead.    Goa is known as a second home destination or an investment destination. Will this change?    The second home market is likely to see some drop and it will take some time to settle down.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Demonetization-will-weed-out-fly-by-night-developers/articleshow/55530798.cms,goa
2016-11-21 12:23:00,PM Narendra Modi signals rate cut post-demonetisation,"AGRA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said his government's demonetisation drive will push banks to cut lending rates significantly, triggering a revival in economic activity in the country.    ""Over Rs 5 lakh crore deposited with banks (so far after the decision to scrap old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes) are not going to be kept idle. Banks will have to extend loans for all sorts of economic enterprise...for which they will have to bring down their interest rates,"" Modi said at a BJP rally in Agra, resuming his campaign for UP assembly polls next year.    The PM pitched the currency ban drive as particularly good for the poor and the middle class, reiterating that the inconveniences being faced by ordinary citizens are temporary.  Also Read: Cash crunch likely to take turn for better, ATM withdrawal limit may be raised from Rs 2,500  ""Madhyam varg ka shoshan band hoga aur gareebon ko uska haq milega (It will put an end to the exploitation of middle class and provide benefits to the poor),"" Modi said a couple of times during his public meeting to assuage the hardship faced by people in depositing old notes into their accounts as well as in withdrawing money from banks and ATMs.    Asserting that this demonetisation move will put an end to situations where people were forced to convert their hard-earned money to black money, he cited the practice of cash donations to schools and cash share of house purchases by honest taxpayers as examples.

""Laws are strict, poor should beware...Keep your hands off others' Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes...Don't get caught into their trap for some cut they are willing to take,"" the prime minister said.

Salve was speaking on the 'Relevance of economic thoughts of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar in the current demonetization scenario', organized by Ambedkar National Students Federation at Ambedkar Sanskrutik Bhavan, Gajanan Nagar, on Sunday. Rajeev Kamble, a lecturer at Institute of Management Technology, also shared his views with Salve. Present on the occasion was Harishchandra Sukhdeve. The purpose of the event, as stated by Salve and Kamble, was to make people understand the economy and how it functions .    Salve said, ""Ambedkar's economic theories have been proven right time and again whenever our economy has suffered."" Talking about the global economic meltdown of 2008, Salve said, ""Ambedkar had predicted this a long time ago and advised governments against deficit financing, saying it will have dire consequences."" He also said, ""There is no theoretical basis of issuing currency on fractional value of gold which is proving to be destructive for poor people.""    Salve said that everyone today is part of dissent that is brewing in the minds of people. ""They are slowly becoming aware of the government's intention which is not in their best interests. This dissent will propel you forward,"" he said.    Both Salve and Kamble rubbished the government's decision to demonetize 500 and 1,000 notes and opined that ""It was an unnecessary move aimed at causing inconvenience to the public"". Salve termed the event as 'remonetization'. According to them, taking such a large amount of money out of circulation has crippled the economy and will leave a lasting effec t.    ""About 40% of our economy is in rural areas and the move of barring cooperative banks from accepting the scrapped notes is a deathblow to the economy,"" said Kamble.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Demonetization-will-affect-development-says-financial-expert/articleshow/55536925.cms,nagpur
2016-11-21 12:19:00,Sivakasi fireworks industry crippled by demonetisation,"MADURAI: It's been about 20 days since Diwali celebrations got over, but Sivakasi's cracker industry - the fireworks hub of the country - is yet to resume full-fledged production. If it was the freaky weather which played spoilsport first, it is demonetisation that is wreaking havoc now.    Working at a feverish pace before Diwali, the industry usually takes a week-long break. The production resumes once the northeast monsoon ends, usually around this time, but most fireworks units are yet to get back to work. While mist, haze and delayed monsoon ensured that the labour-intensive sector remained indoors, demonetisation of high-value currency notes has hit business hard.    Most manufacturers did open their factories by the first week of November and carry out symbolic rituals for commencing production. However, once demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 notes was announced, most of the units suspended their activities. In addition to procuring raw materials, wage is an important component of the industry, according to manufacturers. At least 100 people work in a medium size industry and there are more than 700 fireworks manufacturing units in Sivakasi. ""A typical unit may need 10 lakh a week to manage wages and meet expenditure. With so much of restrictions to withdraw cash, it is difficult to mobilise such volume of money"", said T Kannan, president of The Indian Fireworks Manufacturers Association (TIFMA).",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/Sivakasi-fireworks-industry-crippled-by-demonetisation/articleshow/55537542.cms,madurai
2016-11-21 12:35:00,DMK seeks to cash in on demonetisation,"COIMBATORE: DMK cadres led by the party's deputy youth wing organizer Pynthamil Pari were visiting banks and ATMs in the city on Saturday distributing biscuits and water bottles to those waiting in queues. What was writ large on the symbolic gesture was the fact that Dravidian party has stepped in to reap political mileage of the situation.    With disappointment among large sections of the population in getting new currencies worsening, DMK wants to direct the impending frustration towards BJP and AIADMK. DMK chief M Karunanidhi has announced a human chain protest on November 24 against BJP for 'hasty implementation' of demonetisation and against AIADMK to remaining silent despite travails of public.    Much before him, his son and party treasurer M K Stalin started criticizing the demonetisation excerise. He made it a point to criticise BJP in every political meeting he addressed during the recent bypolls in three assembly constituencies. Both Karunanidhi and Stalin had initially welcomed the Centre's decision, but have eventually launched the attack after sensing the mood at lthe grass roots level.    ""It is painful to see small traders, farmers, labourers standing in queues at banks and ATMs to exchange notes and withdraw money for long hours,"" Stalin said said and also hit out at AIADMK for failing to mitigate the situation. The BJP has in turn hit out saying that those with corruption charges shouldn't criticize the BJP's move to curb black money. ""People have welcomed the decision. Those opposing the demonetisation are not spelling out what alternative measures could have been taken to curb black money,'' said BJP leader C P Radhakrishnan. He blamed opposition parties of creating panic and confusing the public. BJP will distribute pamphlets on positive aspects of the Centre's decision to educate the public. But DMK men say that the sufferings of the common man far outweighed the intentions of the Centre in curbing black money.    There are hundreds suffering for hours in front of banks.

2016-11-21 13:14:00,Arvind Kejriwal retweets misleading photo about man's suicide 'due to demonetization',"NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been making some major Twitter errors lately by retweeting unverified information and then deleting it without a clarification.    On Sunday, the Delhi CM retweeted - then later deleted without explanation - a misleading photograph and caption that purported to show that a man committed suicide because he faced a currency crunch due to demonetization. Later, he retweeted a picture of Syrian refugee children, with a caption that said they were children found at the site of yesterday morning's train accident near Kanpur.    The Delhi CM retweeted a photograph of a man who had hung himself in Satna in Madhya Pradesh. The caption to the photograph Kejriwal retweeted said that the man who hung himself did so because he had not been able to withdraw new currency notes from the bank for four days in a row.    That was patently false, as a  TOI story  showed.    The photograph was of a man who hung himself in Satna, yes, but the reason he did so was not what the caption said, at all.    The man had come to rob the bank and when he realized police had surrounded the bank and he couldn't escape, he decided to end his life. The incident took place at Allahabad Bank's Bela village branch at 3 am on Saturday.    The photograph and caption were originally tweeted by one Abhishek Mishra, who appears to have deleted his account since.    When Kejriwal retweeted it, he wrote in Hindi ""Modiji, look at this. At least now, have some mercy on this country's people. What enmity do you have with the public?""      मोदी जी, ये देखिए। अब तो इस देश के लोगों पे रहम कीजिए। आख़िर क्या दुश्मनी है आपकी जनता से। ग़रीब की इतनी हाय मत लीजिए।    https://t.co/26FPOwYTwo    — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal)    November 20, 2016  Kejriwal later deleted the tweet, again giving no explanation.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Arvind-Kejriwal-retweets-misleading-photo-about-mans-suicide-due-to-demonetization/articleshow/55537891.cms,
2016-11-21 16:48:00,"Demonetisation: GDP can fall by 0.8%, says DBS","MUMBAI: Singaporean brokerage DBS has warned of major downside risks to growth due to India's demonetisation exercise, and has estimated that the gross value added can come down by up to 0.80 per cent lower than its 7.6 per cent target.    ""There are downside risks to the tune of 0.40-0.80 per cent to our gross-value added estimate of 7.6 per cent,"" it said in a note today, nearly a fortnight after the government demonetised the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes.    This projection, however, is very meagre as many brokerages have already projected even a 50 per cent dip in GDP growth, with Ambit Capital being the steepest at 3.6 per cent.    The brokerage said there will be an impact on consumer goods and discretionary spending for at least two quarters, which will impact growth till March 2017.    Cash dependent businesses will be hit the most during this period and rural demand, especially from the unbanked sections, may also moderate, it added.    It, however, said there will be some pent-up demand which can give an upside to growth starting the first quarter of the next fiscal.    By acting on the demand side, the demonetisation move can help reduce inflation by up to 0.20 per cent over the next few months and make the case for a 0.25 per cent rate cut from RBI in first half of 2017 stronger, the brokerage said, adding there will not be a rate cut in the December 6 policy announcement.    On the fiscal side, there will be ""windfall gains"" if the move results in unearthing unaccountable money from the system and will help to increase the proportion of direct tax revenues over indirect collections, it said. But it did not quantify the fiscal gains.    The brokerage was, however, quick to add that the estimates on blackmoney vary widely and there is a risk of overestimation in this assumption.    It also said a slowdown in the passage of other key reforms including the goods and services tax in the ongoing Winter session is being hampered by the banknote reforms.

Instead of standing one behind the other, people just place their belongings in their respective positions in the line. And what do they do? Either sit down or chill out nearby, keeping an eye on how the queue is inching forward. News has it that when some people clicked the pictures of the oddball queues and uploaded them online, the trend spread to other parts of the country too.  When an offertory box turned ATM  An offertory box isn't just to receive money from devotees, but also to pay them back in need, it was recently proven in Kochi. It's the donation box of St Martin De Porrues, Ernakulam that doubled up as an ATM for its devotees, when bank ATMs went dry. Upon realising that its parishioners are pinched for money, the priest announced at the Sunday mass that people can take money from the offertory box, and return it when they can. The box was kept open for a day, from dawn to dusk, and turned saviour for about 200 families who were in dire need of money. Reportedly, the proceedings were quite peaceful, with none trying to take a penny more than required for their immediate need.      He who wants to barter, knows what is best for him      'Bring change. Five hundred and thousand rupee notes not accepted'    While this warning has been put up by most shops in the country in the last two weeks, the situation hardly mattered for certain shops and communities in Kerala. It isn't technology that helps them stand out, but the traditional barter system.    In a village near Munnar, Idukki, Ponnamma runs a grocery store. People buy things in exchange of agricultural products. No need to mention, her business remained unaffected while the country has been undergoing the currency crisis.    Interestingly, she has been trading in barter system for more than 50 years. Same applies to a few tribal settlements near Vazhachal Forest Division near Thrissur, where barter system has been the mode of trade for long.      Gifting wise at trying times      At a time when ATMs are dispensing ` 2,000 notes, it's not easy to convert them into lesser denominations.    However, Keralites have now devised a new way to handle this too by using them in weddings as gifts. The modus operandi is- 'cash gift givers' team up, insert notes of higher denominations into an envelope, and write the names of the contributors on the cover, so that the receiver understands who paid and how much as wedding gift. Through social media platforms, the unique mode of gifting is gaining more 'currency' too, thanks to the persisting cash woes.      Cashing in on 'smart' alerts      These days, standing in queue is easy when compared to locating ATMs with money. A few youngsters have now come up with a solution for the same — they have entered into a pact with shopkeepers near ATMs attached to main banks so that whenever cash is deposited, the youngsters are informed. As a token of gratitude, the informers get paid ` 50 per transactions.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/Dealing-with-demonetisation-Kerala-style/articleshow/55543092.cms,kochi
2016-11-22 00:11:00,Demonetisation: Odisha CM takes up coop bank issue with PM,"BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday once again asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow district cooperative banks to exchange and accept old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. He also sought to exempt the tribals from submission of PAN during bank transactions and allow women self-help groups (SHGs) to operate their bank accounts without restriction.    Naveen, who had raised these demands with the PM through two letters on November 16 and 18, reiterated his demands during a meeting with Modi in New Delhi. Both the BJP and the Congress in the state described Naveen's move as desperate attempts to turn his party's black money white.    Pressing for allowing cooperative banks to exchange the recalled currency notes, Naveen said over 70% of the farmers in Odisha are served through cooperative banks. The cooperative banks, including the district central cooperative banks (DCCBs), primary agricultural cooperative societies and Large-sized Adivasi Multipurpose Cooperative Societies form the lifeline of farmers in Odisha. They provide crop loans and sustain procurement operations in the absence of commercial banks in 4401 out of 6234 gram panchayats in the state. ""The CM urged upon the Prime Minister to direct the Reserve Bank of India to allow DCCBs to participate in the scheme, remove withdrawal restrictions and ensure increased cash flow to these banks,"" a government statement said.    Naveen also requested the PM to issue directives to scheduled commercial banks to open brick and mortar bank branches in all 4401 unbanked gram panchayats by March, 2019, and start mobile bank and temporary counters in rural areas to facilitate transactions in unbanked areas.""    Justifying his demands for PAN exemption to people in scheduled areas (where predominantly scheduled tribes stay) for bank transactions, Naveen said 95% of these do not possess PAN cards and the bank coverage in these areas is abysmally poor. He also asked the PM to allow the SHGs, considered Naveen's loyal vote banks, to fully operate their bank accounts without restriction and engage credible SHGs with proven track records may as banking correspondents/ for handling mobile ATMs to provide the last mile banking service connectivity to unbanked areas.    BJP leader Prithviraj Harichandan, in a statement, said Naveen is looking for a shortcut to convert his party's black money. ""It shows Naveen's stand on demonetization is no different from that of his counterparts in Uttar Pradesh (Akhilesh Yadav), West Bengal (Mamata Banerjee) and Delhi (Arvind Kejriwal),"" Harichandan said. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday had criticised Naveen for his letters to PM on these issues. Senior Congress leader Narasingha Mishra said after welcoming the Centre's move, Naveen is now perturbed about his own black money. ""It only exposes Naveen's doublespeak on black money,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Demonetisation-Odisha-CM-takes-up-coop-bank-issue-with-PM/articleshow/55549958.cms,bhubaneswar
2016-11-22 00:04:00,Cong to raise demonetization woes to counter BJP attack,"The burning issue of the day - the plight of the cash-starved aam aadmi due to demonetization - has come in handy for the Congress to counter the BJP, which is geared to take on the ruling party on a host of issues. The Congress and JD(S) decided to rake up the issue to highlight its harmful impact on the common man in both houses of legislature.    Chief minister Siddaramaiah, who held an informal meeting with Congress legislators, favoured a discussion on the issue, saying it's the need of the hour. The CM has already written twice to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, urging him to take immediate steps to mitigate the difficulties faced by the common man, and also urging him to review the decision to bar cooperative banks from exchanging old currency notes.    Legislative assembly speaker KB Koliwad said he would allow a debate on the issue although demonetization was a decision taken by the Centre. ""The state government cannot provide any answer to the debate. But considering that several people in the state are facing a cash crunch, I may allow the House to discuss it,"" he said.    Two panels to advise govt    Two new legislature panels may soon be constituted to study and advise the state government on issues related to the state's land, water, language and revenue collection. In its interim report tabled in the assembly on Monday, the joint committee on rules of the legislature headed by senior BJP MLC Ramachandra Gowda recommended constituting a legislature committee to safeguard land, water and the state's official language, and another committee on the government's revenue.    ""There has been a hue and cry over land grabbing, lake encroachment, river disputes and Kannada in recent times. The new committee may examine and find ways to protect them by making suitable recommendations,"" former minister and senior member of the joint rules committee Kimmane Ratnakar said after tabling the report. According to the report, the committee on safeguarding land, water and official language, headed by the speaker, will have 19 members, while the committee on revenue, headed by the council chairman, will have 17 members. The members should be elected by the House by means of single transferable vote.    Chairman pulls up Priyank    Legislative council chairman DH Shankaramurthy on Monday pulled up IT-BT minister Priyank Kharge and his department for a lack of coordination and for making members run from pillar to post for their response. The reprimand was triggered by a query by Mahantesh Kavatagimat (BJP) on the status of Belagavi IT park and why it was transferred from the IT-BT department to the industries department. Angry with Kharge for an unconvincing reply, Shankarmurthy said: ""A senior IAS officer sent me a letter stating the question has been transferred to the industries department. When a question has been posed to your department, which pertains to an IT park, does your department have no commitment to the cause? The officer should have contacted his counterpart in the industries department and prepared a response. This is unacceptable, and a reply must come within next week on the question.""    According to the minister, the matter vested with the industries department and KSSIDC was developing the park. Interestingly, former IT-BT minister SR Patil endorsed the chair's view and said the IT-BT minister must respond. However, House leader and home minister G Parameshwara said the government will provide a response on the IT park from industries minister RV Deshpande.    Doreswamy demands poor rights    Hundreds of protesters, mainly women, continued their protest near Suvarna Vidhana Soudha on Monday under the leadership of freedom fighter and Gandhian HS Doreswamy, to pitch their demand for land and shelter to the common man. Nonagenarian Doreswamy, protesting under the banner of Bhumi, Vasati Hakku Vanchitara Horata Samiti, is demanding that one day of the session be reserved to discuss the plight of the common man and poor.    The government should adopt a policy which aims to provide land to the poor, and a delegation has already met revenue minister Kagodu Thimmappa to regularize bagar hukum forest and revenue land, and also houses built on government land.

2016-11-22 00:36:00,"Driven by demonetization, auto drivers go the extra mile to woo passengers","THANE: The demonetisation act seems to have made auto drivers in the lake city a bit friendly to customers as they are not turning down residents even for short distances.    The demonetisation announcement is making people run from pillar to post in order to either get their currencies exchanged or to withdraw money. Due to cash crunch, many have also started avoiding travelling by auto. Due to this, some auto drivers have gone the extra mile and are keeping a lot of change with them so that passengers do not have a problem. Many auto drivers have also started waiting outside ATM centres and banks to ferrying passengers.    Some drivers have gone the extra mile by waiting in long queues at banks to get change so that they can convince customers to ply by their vehicle. Auto driver Anamika Bhalerao said, ''The demonetisation move has affected our business a lot as most residents are now either travelling by bus or just walking it down in order to save up. Also many are travelling by private cabs as they offer online transactions. Few customers who are plying by autos either hand over Rs 500 or Rs 2,000 notes. So we have to keep change with us, else we loose out on a customer.''    Some auto drivers have also extended their timings and have cut down on breaks just to earn a few hundereds of rupees. ''I have started extending my timings and cut down on breaks. But still I am able to earn only Rs 500 daily. Earlier, I used to earn around Rs 700 to Rs 800 a day. Despite waiting in crowded areas like Gaodevi and station, I get a passenger after almost half-an-hour,'' Bhaleroa added.    Uday Panday, a Louiswadi-based auto driver, said, ""The best way to get customers is to tell them we have change. I stand in the queue outside the bank early morning daily and get as much change as I can. The big denomination notes I give to my wife and the rest I keep as change for passengers.""    This change in the willingness of auto-drivers to travel anywhere has, however, come as a boon to citizens.    ""I live just ten minutes away from the station. Earlier, I used to never get an auto for such a short distance. However, nowadays there is a queue of autos who are ready to travel anywhere,"" said Sumitra Joshi, a Naupada resident.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/Driven-by-demonetization-auto-drivers-go-the-extra-mile-to-woo-passengers/articleshow/55547857.cms,thane
2016-11-22 04:00:00,Demonetization takes heavy toll on MMF sector: SRTEPC,"Surat: The after-effects of demonetization seems to have taken a toll of the country's largest man-made fabric (MMF) sector. According to the Synthetic and Rayon Textile Export Promotion Council (SRTEPC), the textile trade has become 'zero' with the weavers, textile processors and traders facing severe liquidity crunch amid dwindling demand of fabrics and cloth from the key consumer market in the country.    The delegates from SRTEPC and around 17 other export promotion councils across the country—two members each from the councils—attended the meeting convened by the central government on getting the feedback on the 'impact of demonetisation on the trade and commerce' at New Delhi on Monday.    The vice-chairman of SRTEPC, in its presentation on the impact of demonetisation on textile sector pointed out that the man-made fabric (MMF) sector is facing dire situation and on the verge of collapse. Only 30 per cent of the units are operational, whereas the rest have shut down due to the impact of demonetisation.    Talking with TOI, SRTEPC's vice-chairman Narain Agarwal said, ""Barring spinning units, majority of yarn preparatory, texturizing, sizing, twisting, warping, weaving, processing and embroidery units have been paying wages in cash to the workers. They maintain accounts for the same and it reflects in their balance sheets. After demonetisation, wages to the workers has been a big question. Thus, we have demanded that the unit owners should get cash in new currency, meanwhile the workers would be encouraged to open bank accounts.""    Agarwal added, ""From manufacturers to wholesale to retail and consumer, there is no demand in the market. Liquidity of cash is almost squeezed due to demonetisation. This has led to the closure of 80 per cent of the textile processing units, weavers forced to operate eight hours a day and almost 90 per cent embroidery and knitting units closed.""    According to Agarwal, the ministry of textile has sought written representation from the SRTEPC on the impact of demonetization on textile sector. The SRTEPC will be submitting the same on Tuesday.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/Demonetization-takes-heavy-toll-on-MMF-sector-SRTEPC/articleshow/55548468.cms,surat

2016-11-22 11:06:00,Demonetisation: MSMEs at a loss,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The demonetisation drive launched by the central government has affected business activities of nearly 3,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) operating from the district.    The MSME industry provides direct employment to nearly 30,000 persons and indirect employment to around 40,000 people. According to industry sources, day-to-day business has been impacted especially for work involving those employed indirectly. While Autonagar itself has more than 1,000 MSMEs, the remaining are scattered across different industrial estates in the district.    The MSMEs in the district cater to different sectors such as steel, food processing, chemicals, automobile, rubber and plastic among others.    Speaking to TOI, Visakha Autonagar Small Scale Industrialists Welfare Association (VASSI) president AK Balaji said, ""Regular employees for MSMEs won't have much problems because they have bank accounts. But, when it comes to short term workers who are employed for 3-5 days or on a daily-basis, payment is an issue due to the lack of lower denominations.""    He further mentioned that the restriction on withdrawals (Rs 50,000 per week for businesses) is also causing difficulties. ""Some of the organised industries like those supplying to PSUs may not be impacted much, but those dependent on daily sales are getting hit.""    Among those industries which are involved in daily sales include fabrication units, equipment manufacturers, service manufacturers, paper bag manufacturers, food processing units, spare part manufacturers, chemicals, tyre re-treading and rubber industries.    According to another industrialist based out of Gajuwaka, ""Initially, we had asked our vendors to wait for some time so that we can pay them once the cash starts to flow from the banks. But, now it has been almost 12 days, but we are not getting sufficient liquidity. Even if we want to pay workers, we are not able to get Rs 100 notes. They are not accepting Rs 2,000 notes as it is not useful for them in the markets.""    In addition to the monetary losses, he said the man hours lost due to the demonetisation drive has had an impact on production. ""Many workers say we have to go the bank and we can't deny them either,"" the industrialist said, adding that the man hours lost due to this has to be evaluated to understand the actual downturn in business.

2016-11-22 06:56:00,"Demonetisation: Govt moves to ease pain for Nepal, Bhutan & expats","NEW DELHI: A joint committee of the foreign and finance ministries will issue instructions this week to ease demonetisation pains in Nepal, Bhutan, among Indian expatriates in different countries and foreign diplomats stationed in India.    The group was set up after Nepal PM Prachanda called Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week to ask for a solution to the fact that Nepal was sitting on crores of old Indian currency notes. Led by additional secretary in the finance ministry A Tyagi and joint secretary (north) in MEA Sudhakar Dalela, the group has met several times and is scheduled to meet again on Tuesda .    Nepal and Bhutan, where Indian currency is legal tender, are likely to be asked to hold the deposits following due process, which will include know-your customer (KYC) compliance and proper paperwork on identity of holder of the currency notes. These will then be exchanged by the Indian government. For many years, the Nepal government had outlawed the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.Ironically, these were readmitted as legal tender in Nepal when Modi visited in 2014. work in India and remit money back home.    There are others engaged in cross-border trade across the open frontier, and still others who come to India for medical treatment or education and many who use Indian currency to buy essentials for daily living, particularly in the border regions. They have been hit hard by the demonetisation drive. However, Nepal is also a known conduit for fake Indian currency , so the government body is expected to call for vetting of the currency notes in Nepal before the holders are compensated. This could delay the compensation process, as well as add to the pain of many in Nepal who may have been transmitting fake notes, perhaps unknowingly .    Border trade in countries around India -Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan -is taking a hit, according to sources, due to the currency crunch. In Bangladesh, while the Indian rupee is not legal tender, many traders, businessmen and transporters have been using Indian currency for their cash transactions, which are now rendered illegal. Bangladesh used to be a huge transit point for fake currency as well, but in the past few years, the Sheikh Hasina government has cracked down on the ISI-sponsored network, rolling up many of their operations.    However, money exchange traders in Kabul have reportedly said they were holding about Rs 60 crore in Indian currency notes. Since Kabul is a big transit centre for Indian notes from Pakistan, these currency traders may not get satisfaction, unless the notes are proved to be genuine.    Foreign ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said last week that money exchange associations in places like Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong had asked how they would dispose of old Indian currency notes.Since the rupee is not yet a convertible currency , the government will have to find a way to not let them down in a way that diminishes faith in the credibility of the Indian currency .",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Govt-moves-to-ease-pain-for-Nepal-Bhutan-expats/articleshow/55552779.cms,
2016-11-22 09:31:00,Demonetisation: Lost money could be used for aam aadmi,"NEW DELHI: A section of the government is of the view that demonetisation presents an opportunity to access additional funds that can be used for social welfare schemes, creating infrastructure, waiving farm loans, increasing agriculture spend, as well as other populist measures.    This section of the government is of the view that the total value of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes not returned by December 30, should accrue to the exchequer.    A senior minister said the difference between the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in circulation (Rs 14.2 lakh crore) and the notes deposited could run into lakhs of crores and this can be used by the government.    “A lot of money, which is the black or unaccounted money in the system, will not be exchanged or deposited. This money should be utilised by the government for various schemes,” the minister said.    His comment reflects the view of a section of the government that for demonetisation and the war against black money to be deemed successful, it should result in tangible gains for the common people.    The minister added that the money deposited in bank accounts because of demonetisation will result in interest rates to fall and the rupee to strengthen.    As on November 18, Rs 5.44 lakh crore had been either deposited in banks or exchanged. Independent experts estimate that eventually about Rs 3 lakh crore high value currency will not be returned.    But there is confusion among policy makers and experts as to how such ‘lost’ currency will be accounted for in the Reserve Bank of India’s books and how the government can access this money either for reducing its fiscal deficit or for the kind of funding proposed by the minister quoted above.    All currency issued by the Reserve Bank of India is a legal obligation to pay the bearer a sum equivalent to the value of currency. The government has so far said that the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes cease to be legal tender but until the time that the unreturned notes are not extinguished, they will continue to be a liability on the central bank’s books.    Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said said legislative changes will be made to extinguish the unreturned currency, indicating that the government wants to tap into this expected large gain.    “So far formally the high denominational currency has ceased to be a legal tender. Some more legal steps will be required later on if one is to extinguish that,” he said.    The government is expected to propose these legislative changes after December 30, and these could pave the way for Reserve Bank’s liability to come down and consequentially its capacity to pay higher dividend to the government will go up.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Lost-money-could-be-used-for-aam-aadmi/articleshow/55554383.cms,
2016-11-22 08:34:00,The man who gave Modi the idea of demonetisation slams implementation,"When demonetisation was announced and Narendra Modi was being credited with a 'surgical strike' on black money, Pune resident Anil Bokil and his think-tank --ArthaKranti Pratishthan -- went to town about his nine-minute meeting with Modi in July, which stretched to two hours, and inspired the move.    Now, when the country has been forced to queue up outside banks and mostly defunct ATMs, Bokil blames the mess on the government using his advice ""selectively"". He told Mirror that he was on his way to Delhi for a meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday. There was no confirmation of this from PMO, though. Here's what he has to say, on what went wrong during the 'surgical strike' on black money.    The proposal I placed before the PM was a comprehensive one and had five aspects. However, the government chose to use only two of them. It was a sudden move, not well-thought-out. The move cannot be welcomed or rejected. We are compelled to accept it. The road map we gave the government would not have caused such pain.    WE HAD SUGGESTED:    1: Complete abolition of taxes, direct and indirect by the Central or State governments and also the local bodies.    2: The taxes were to be replaced with Bank Transaction Tax (BTT), wherein every inward bank transaction would attract a levy (say about two per cent). It would be a single point tax deducted at source. - The deducted amount would go into the government kitties at various levels (Centre, State and Local, broken up in perhaps a ratio of 0.7 per cent, 0.6 per cent and 0.35 per cent, respectively). The concerned bank will also get a share of say another 0.35 per cent. Of course, the BTT rate would be decided by the finance ministry and Reserve Bank of India.    3: Cash transactions (withdrawals) would not attract tax.    4: All high denomination currency (anything above Rs 50) should be withdrawn.    5: Government should create legal provision to restrict cash transactions to Rs 2,000.    If all these were done together, it would have not only benefitted the common man but also changed the system completely.    We did not expect the death we are witnessing. But the government announced the operation without using anaesthesia, so patients are bound to lose their lives. We have been working on this proposal for 16 years, since ArthaKranti was formed in 2000. A 16-member technical committee had come up with the proposal and guaranteed that not a single person would be affected. The move would be targeted only on eradicating black money and terrorism and also end ransom-linked crimes. It would have affected property prices and also impacted the GDP.

2016-11-23 13:11:00,RJD fires fresh salvos at Prime minister over demonetisation,"PATNA: RJD boss Lalu Prasad and his son and deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav continued with their attack on the Centre on Tuesday for demonetising Rs1000 and Rs500 notes from November 8. They also questioned the success and fallout of the PM Narendra Modi's move.    Lalu raised question over the recovery of new Rs2000 notes from terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir and asked why the PM was shying away from Parliament and how long will the ""queue up India"" project will last.    ""Terrible! It's not merely 15 days & terrorists have new notes. Deadly serious ... Total system failure ... Modi Ji who will owe this fault? Will U?"" Lalu tweeted after the recovery of new notes of Rs2000 denomination from two terrorists neutralized by the security forces in Bandipora in Jammu and Kashmir.    Earlier, Lalu had termed demonetisation as 'fargical strike' while targeting the PM who had claimed that the demonetisation of high-value currency notes would break the backbone of terror funding.    Tejashwi followed his father in attacking the Centre on demonetisation and the problems being faced by the people standing in long queues at banks and ATMs. ""Can anyone from the central government tell how long this project of 'Queue-up India' will last or will it die its natural death like other projects?"" said Tejashwi.    On the pandemonium in Parliament over the issue and PM's absence from the House, Tejashwi tweeted, ""Why does the PM fear to enter the temple of democracy. If he can go to a music concert and address a political rally, what is the problem in visiting Parliament.""    The RJD scion also re-tweeted the post of a regional newspaper saying that according to ""political guru of BJP chief Amit Shah, many people close to him were aware of demonetisation decision and he has a video of that.""    RJD vice-president and former Union minister Rabghuvansh Prasad Singh also attacked PM on demonetisation.

In a letter addressed to health minister K K Shylaja, AKCDA has sought the government to direct manufacturers of pharmaceutical medicines to extend additional credit facility of 21 days for maintaining the supply chain of life saving drugs in view of possible shortages.    Representatives of the association said in Kochi on Monday that medicine dealers are experiencing difficulty in honouring the post-dated cheques issued to the manufacturers against the supplies made during the month of October and early November.    Though the retail chemists are allowed to accept the demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from the customers against sales with valid prescription, they are not able to deposit or transact such notes as they are no longer the legal tender.    ""Owning moral responsibilities, we have requested all member wholesalers and retailers to maintain the supply chain to make available lifesaving drugs to the general public.We have requested the manufacturers who are marketing their medicines in the state to provide us additional credit facility of 21 days to tide over the present situation and to make available life-saving drugs without shortage,"" said A N Mohanan, president of AKCDA.

2016-11-22 12:28:00,'Demonetisation will boost cash deposits in Jan Dhan accounts',"TRICHY: Cashless transactions have witnessed a surge after demonetisation, since banks too have been instructed to minimise charges for online payments, said B Srinivasan, deputy financial advisor and chief accounts officer, Southern Railway. He was interacting with MBA students of Bharathidasan University. (BDU)    While the country is slowly moving towards the use of plastic currency, the number of Jan Dhan accounts has recorded a stellar growth over the past two years, he added. These accounts occupy only one percent of the total deposit base. Demonetisation should boost cash deposits in Jan Dhan accounts, 43 percent of which have so far remained dormant.    Jan Dhan accounts were aimed at financial inclusion of large masses, allowing people to save their money in banks, as opposed to hard earned cash being stored at home for years together.    A rise in deposit base would allow banks to lower blended cost of funds as higher deposits in current, savings accounts, would help replenish the high cost of borrowing and lower the over all cost of funds. ""We expect banks to reduce deposit rates over the next six months,"" he said.    On the long-term impact of demonetisation, he said that global agencies had pegged the size of the parallel economy in India at close to 23 percent as of 2007. A significant proportion of the unaccounted cash in the economy will make its way to the banks, thus boosting deposit base as well as financial savings, he said.    The economy will shift from the unorganised to the organized sector, dovetailing into the GST architecture that is expected to come on board next year. This is likely to enhance the government's ability to tax commercial transactions resulting in a structural improvement in tax to GDP ratio in the economy, he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/Demonetisation-will-boost-cash-deposits-in-Jan-Dhan-accounts/articleshow/55557286.cms,trichy

2016-11-23 01:00:00,"Post demonetisation, Mumbai college students change their lifestyle","The move towards demonetisation has either been welcomed or faced with resistance on the campus, especially since college students tend to rely on their pocket monies. The teething troubles that 'no money November' has brought with it is now becoming a thing of the past as students have found ways to cope with it. For instance, they are...  Saying goodbye to junk food  In trying to save dough for a rainy day, youngsters are cutting down on their calorie intake. Take the case of Pranil Tailor, a first-year mass media student. He now prefers his maa ke haath ka khaana over canteen food. He has decided to replace his frankies with roti rolls. ""It's a good in a way as I have started eating healthy. It is economical, too,"" he says.  Hanging out at college premises  Now, students choose to hang out at campuses rather than the coolest cafes in town. Campuses are abuzz with students listening to music, chatting and sharing dabbas. Final-year student Mallika Kelkar says, ""Hanging out usually meant a place that was easy to travel to and had good ambience and food. Now, my friends and I prefer to chill out on the campus itself. If we do decide to go out, we first call up to check if the place accepts debit cards.""    ""I receive my pocket money in cash, so I think twice before any purchase,"" Mallika adds. Birthday celebrations, chilling after exams and movie outings have now taken a backseat.  Taking a bus. Public transport zindabad!  Students have started taking public transports and walking to colleges from railway stations instead of hopping into a cab. Journalism student Jagruti Verma says, ""I save on a lot of small change this way. Plus, I've become more punctual and this short walk takes care of my workout, too.""  Learning to prioritise and save  Demonetisation is also turning out to be a lesson in savings and getting one's priorities in place. Akash Vishwakarma, a final year engineering student, shares, ""The episode has put things in perspective for me. I have started using plastic cash for urgent expenditures.""  Where they feel the pinch:Tough times for outstation students  Vrinda Parwal, who hails from Kolkata and studies in a suburban college, says, ""We mostly reserve 500s and 1000s to help us get through. It was extremely difficult to even have lunch. I'm not particularly kicked about this move and have, in fact, started hating pink!""  College festivals feel the heat  Some colleges like Mithibai are already halfway through the preparation, so the impact was less. Varun Vithalani, vice chairperson of the upcoming college festival, informs, ""Most of our transactions took place before the move. But now, we are only accepting new currency. As for the petty cash, we are using all that we have and will reimburse it later.""    Second-year mass media student Antoinette D'Souza from St Andrew's had a tough time sourcing materials. ""We went to Malad to purchase stuff at reasonable amounts, but couldn't get change for Rs 2,000. Eventually, we had to ask some police officials for help,"" she says.  No more lavish dates  Pranil agrees that many of his friends have moved from burgers at popular joints to vada pavs, and Meet Gogri, a final-year mass media student, has started using debit cards while going out with his girlfriend. Akash frequents cafes that allow them to sit for hours even if they don't order anything at all. He quips, ""The lavish spending has gone, but the love remains.""      Provisions being made for students      College canteens are accepting debit cards for payments.    Instead of asking students to photocopy notes, lecturers are email them.    Colleges are educating students on the use of digital wallets.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Post-demonetisation-Mumbai-college-students-change-their-lifestyle/articleshow/55561261.cms,mumbai
2016-11-23 01:00:00,No cash for cards: Chawri Bazaar card biz hit by demonetization,"Going to old Delhi ahead of the wedding season is usually a formidable task - the crowds in the popular wedding markets are a regular feature at this time of the year. Usually, that is. The demonetization, the resulting cash crunch and the fact that a lot of wedding spending in India is in cash has led to empty streets in areas like Chawri Bazaar, the hub of the wedding cards sector in the city.    Cardwalas in the market sit in empty shops, otherwise filled with families at this time, counting their losses as families cancel orders, refuse to pick up printed cards due to a lack of cash for payment, or say thank you so much, we'll use e-invites instead. Card makers we met on a walk-through told us they're often delivering half the order printed or asking customers to at least pay for the wedding cards that have already been printed.      'Kaam hai nahin, sabne orders cancel kar diye hain'      Neeraj Jain, one of the shopkeepers in Chawri Bazaar, tells us, ""There is no work for anyone in the market at this time, which is otherwise our 'season' to earn. Kisi ke paas kaam nahin hai.""    Adds card shop owner Neeraj Jain, ""We had 10 orders for the printing of wedding cards for next month (December) and January. Par logon ne humein mana kar diya hai ki hum nahin lene aa sakte cards, jo print ho gaye hain na woh lene aa rahe hain, jo hone thay, unpe aap abhi kaam rok do. Nobody knows when the situation will change - people have no money to pay us.""    The situation was the same everywhere - other shopkeepers also opened their shops very late, and others came to work only after a week after the demonetization. ""Aaj hi toh market khuli hai itne dino baad. Humne bhi itni late dukaan kholi hai, kaam hai hi nahin. We had almost six orders for December, but when I called them two days back to ask if I should start printing, they asked me not to print the cards. November ke cards ja chuke hain pehle hi, December mein kaam hai nahin aur January ka kuch pata nahin kya hoga,"" adds Mohammad Faizan, another shopkeeper.      '500 se 50 cards pe aa gaye hain customers'      Some customers have cancelled all their orders; some shopkeepers who are managing to earn something are not able to even cover the cost of printing the cards ordered. Raumi Dubey, also a shopkeeper in the market, says, ""Humare chaar order cancel ho gaye hain. When I called the customers, they told me they had no money to pay. Two families have postponed weddings, ab pata nahin kab karenge. The other three orders that I have, they are coming to collect the order, but have cut down on the numbers drastically. One of the customers is taking only 50 cards as opposed to the 500 that were ordered. The other one is taking only 250 out of 400. Batao, aisa kaise chalega?""    Sumit Wasan, another shopkeeper, adds, ""Our customers are saying that they will invite guests by calling them or by e-invites. Others are saying they cannot afford to have a grand affair, so they'd prefer an intimate wedding, inviting only family members. Jo 200 cards print karwa rahe thay, woh bas 60 leke ja rahe hain.""      'Can mention mobile payments on cards if the customers ask us'      The cash crunch is a problem not just for card makers, but also for those ordering them - how to ask for electronic payments as sagan is the question! ""Logon ko dar toh hai ki unhe koi purana Rs 500 ya Rs 1,000 ka note na dede. Abhi tak humare paas koi aaya nahin hai jisne kaha ho mobile payment ka option card pe print karne ke liye, par aayega toh hum print karwa denge card pe ki 'You can send your wishes through e-wallets'. We can add this option depending on customers' demands,"" says Neeraj Jain. Raumi Dubey adds, ""Though this would help many people, I don't think they'll ask us to print this. Mujhe nahin lagta woh achha lagega, aisa lagega bas gifts ke liye bula rahe hain guests ko.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/No-cash-for-cards-Chawri-Bazaar-card-biz-hit-by-demonetization/articleshow/55564848.cms,delhi

The statistics also show a 52% dip in revenue collections by the RTO, from Rs 4.63 crore between November 1-8 to around Rs 2.24 crore between November 9-16.    The demonetisation was announced on November 8. Suburban RTOs too witnessed a drop in revenue during the same period, but it did not have much impact on vehicle registrations which increased for two-wheelers, sources said.    ""The RTO in the island city also compared figures of new car registrations in November 1-19 with the same period last year, and found car registrations dropped by 35% while bike registrations fell by 6%,"" said a senior official, adding it had more to do with the ongoing 'currency crisis'. ""The situation may return to normal, but may take some time,"" the official observed.    A car dealer said there was no drop in inquiries by customers for new cars or bikes. But many preferred to hold on to the cash due to the ongoing 'crisis' while some had no problems paying the entire money by cheque and/or by bank loans.    The RTO data also showed a drop in new taxi registrations by 51% while not a single ambulance was registered between November 9-16, compared to five ambulances registered in the first eight days of the month. While the statistics were available only for the island city, between Colaba/Cuffe Parade and Sion/Mahim, department sources said the suburban RTOs witnessed a drop in revenue collections although in some RTOs like Andheri, there was an increase in two-wheeler registrations.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Island-city-RTO-sees-52-drop-in-post-demonetisation-revenue/articleshow/55569895.cms,mumbai

The PM on Tuesday launched a survey on an app named Narendra Modi App, and asked people to give their feedback whether they mind the inconvenience being faced by them due to the demonetisation decision and how they rate the move and make suggestions to the PM, if any.    Patna based trader Nihar Hisariya said though business has dropped by 60-70% in the ongoing marriage season, businessmen are readily suffering the losses with the hope of a brighter future. ""Demonetisation is a mission initiated by PM Modi to bring all the valid currency into circulation, which would ultimately benefit everyone. Thus, we are ready to face the hardships, at present, with a hope of successful completion of this mission,"" Nihar said.    Similar views were expressed by Patna high court lawyer Ravi Parmar. ""The results of demonetisation are yet to be seen. I admit that there are some initial sufferings, but all of this is being done to achieve a larger goal. My only concern is for the people in the rural areas and the poor, who must be suffering a lot due to less circulation of cash,"" said Ravi.    Student Piyush Shahi said PM's move would prove to be fruitful in the long run. ""Initial hiccups are obvious, though,"" he said.    However, there were a few people who opposed the demonetisation move due to hassles faced by them in withdrawing money. ""People will change their views soon. It is insane to stand in queue to withdraw your own hard-earned money. Banks are working but all seems handicapped without proper cash flows. So, this is a disastrous policy,"" said Kulbir Singh of Kidwaipuri area in the town.    The Modi app can be downloaded on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone handsets, after sign up by the users. The questions asked on the app is like ""do you mind the inconvenience faced in our fight to curb corruption, black money, terrorism and counterfeiting of currency?"" Respondents can choose from 'Not at all', 'Somewhat, but it was worth it' and 'Yes'. In another question, the respondents have been asked whether black money exists in India. Respondents have to apply in 'yes' or 'no'.    Incidentally, chief minister Nitish Kumar also recently sought feedback from people on prohibition in Bihar after protest against it from some quarters. The state government started inviting suggestions on the provisions in Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, from November 1 and the process concluded on November 12.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Mixed-response-to-PMs-app-on-demonetisation/articleshow/55568881.cms,patna
2016-11-23 11:30:00,"Demonetisation: Windfall for municipalities as 47 civic bodies collect Rs 13,192 crore","NEW DELHI: The Centre's demonetisation decision has led to a windfall for 47 municipalities, pushing up their total tax revenue for this month to over two and a half times the sum collected in November last year.    According to the Union urban development ministry's estimates, by Tuesday, the municipal tax collection for the 47 civic bodies had reached Rs 13,192 crore. Last November, the municipalities had collected just Rs 3,607 crore.    Mumbai has the maximum share of the increased tax collection at Rs 11,913 crore, which is 90% of the total revenue. This is over three times Mumbai's collection for 2015. However, Hyderabad accounts for the maximum increase — 26 times the tax collection in November 2015. Surat's tax revenue of Rs 100 crore marked a nearly 14-fold increase.    Sharing the details, Union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu said this was one kind of change that had happened as a result of the decision to  demonetise the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes+  . He said the government's move had forced defaulters to deposit their dues. There have been reports of people queuing up with old notes to pay their dues.    Naidu said the municipal bodies would use the money to better services.    He added that the current NDA government had approved more houses for the urban poor than UPA's did in 10 years. In the past one and a half year, 12.84 lakh affordable houses had been sanctioned, against 12.40 lakh under UPA, he said. Naidu claimed this ""speaks volumes about the sense of urgency that this government is according to make a difference to the urban sector, which is the need of the hour"".

First, majority of them failed to sow crops because of demonetization and secondly due to cancellation of trains they were not able to resume their duty on time. Those having little capital and limited source of income faced the severe aftermath of derailment and demonetization.    Mohal Lal, who was travelling in Lokmanya Tilak-Gorakhpur Kushinagar Express which reached Kanpur Eentral at 2 pm on Tuesday, said that this train had reached Gorakhpur 12 hours late on Monday and because of which it departed 15 hours late for its return journey to Mumbai.

He said that he was able to plough his field and sow wheat crop nor able to reach Mumbai on time which is causing a loss of Rs 600 per day. Despite the fact that tracks between Pukhrayan and Malasa station had been restored on Monday night, most of the trains which connect the commercial capital of the country with other cities in UP like Kanpur, Lucknow and Gorakhpur are running late.

Giving this information to reporters on Tuesday, AAP spokesman Ashish Khetan said that Kejriwal had already opposing demonetization in Delhi and Punjab. Kejriwal's campaign in UP will start from Meerut, where he will address a rally on on December 1. On December 18, Kejriwal will address a rally in Lucknow to 'expose' Modi government on demonetisation. It will be the second visit of Kejriwal to the city after contesting 2014 Parliamentary elections against Modi. In February, Kejriwal had visited Ravidas temple to take part in Ravidas Jayanti celebration, when Modi had also arrived in the city for same purpose.    Reiterating AAP'a allegation that demonetization of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes is the biggest scam in country's history, Khetan said that instead of bringing back the black money of Rs 80 lakh crore deposited in foreign banks, Modi government forced the common men and poor people of country to struggle in getting their own money exchanged. He alleged that Modi government has a list of 800 people, who have deposited black money in foreign banks. The CBI and income tax department is also aware about black money hoarders but no action is being initiated against them.    Khetan alleged that demonetization had paralyzed trade while unemployment is increasing due to this decision of Modi government. Because of ill-preparation of the Union government, people are dying in queues in and around the banks. He alleged that cash reaching banks to provide people relief to the people is being taken by the leaders of Bhartiya Janata Party.

Six months ago, the saffron party thrashed Congress to win its first assembly election in the state riding on illegal migrants issue, which has been a tried and tested election winning subject every election.    BJP had scripted a similar success story in the Lok Sabha election in 2014 in Assam with the same issue.    The two b-poll victories in Lakhimpur Lok Sabha and Baithalangsu assembly constituencies have come at a time when the BJP governments both at the centre and state have been drawing flak over the Centre's proposal to amend the Citizenship Act to convert illegal Hindu Bangladeshi migrants to Indian citizens. BJP claims this issue was overshadowed by the storm created by the mega demonetization exercise.    Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, after meeting Modi earlier in the the day in New Delhi, said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has unleashed a jihad against corruption and people of Assam have approved the stand taken by the PM in regard to demonization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. The mandate signifies people's faith in the efforts of the present dispensation for bringing a tangible change in their lives.""    Taking a dig at Congress, Sonowal said, ""Congress tried to misguide the people of Assam but failed miserably. All sections of people in Assam have supported the PM. I believe that the situation is same across the country. I think Congress should go to the people instead of trying to misguide the people.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/Demonetization-led-to-bypoll-win-BJP/articleshow/55572296.cms,guwahati

Many managements in the district are finding it difficult to run their institutions following demonetisation. Barring a few institutions, most of them used to collect donations from the students without providing authentic receipts. They also used to harass their staff by not paying them well and on time. Now all this has stopped due to demonetisation.    ""Without collecting donations from the students it is very difficult to provide quality education to them. Right from buying a chalk piece to giving salary to the staff, we have to spend money. Now that all these expenditures are accounted, the going is going to be really tough in coming days for private institutions, said Nagesh Bhat (name changed) chairman of a private college management.    'It is true that money collected without receipt is black money but we were utilizing it for the development of our institution. Nobody has deposited it in banks to earn interest. Now all that money has turned into pieces of paper, we are finding it difficult to take up even day-to-day maintenance forget about paying salaries to the staff. In October only, we had collected the half yearly donations in scrapped currency which has become useless now,"" he said.    But parents are rejoicing the situation. ""Whatever has happened happened for the good of the parents. Otherwise, these institutions used to fleece them by way of collecting hefty donations. Even for an UKG admission, they used to collect a minimum Rs. 25,000 as donation. These educational institutions are the biggest black money generators. The IT authorities should immediately go into the accounts of such institutions,"" said Narahari Pai, a parent.    'By converting donations into the black money these institutions create an impression in the minds of the students that black money is part of our life. It should be stopped.

2016-11-23 09:38:00,Over half of the demonetised notes are exchanged; bank queues to ease soon,"MUMBAI: After a gruelling two weeks, bank executives can expect to breathe easy soon. With over half of the currency notes that have ceased to be legal tender being deposited or exchanged, long queues in front of banks may soon shrink, say industry experts.    Economists feel structural change in payment habits of individuals, who are likely to increasingly opt for cashless forms of spending, will help ease the cash crunch situation in the country. Also with more ATMs getting calibrated to dispense the newly-designed notes, there will soon be a letup in disruption level, they said.    “The initial rush to exchange notes is likely to ease as withdrawal limits are lifted alongside improved access to ATMs and shift towards other cashless avenues,” said Radhika Rao, India economist at DBS. “Deposits are thereby likely to grow further over the next month, but the pace of growth might ease as more exchanges occur into new denominations,” she added.    Of the Rs 10-11 lakh crore worth of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes expected to be surrendered by the stipulated deadline of December 31, cash worth Rs 5.4 lakh crore has already been collected by banks between November 10 and November 18, according to RBI data.    “Though, over the next 40 days we might see inflows of Rs 5-7 lakh crore, the pace of deposits may moderate as withdrawals are likely to pick up,” said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist, Axis Bank. “Also, there may be a progressive shift to fixed deposits from savings bank accounts,” he added. However, Bhattacharya feels that banks may witness certain stickiness in deposits and may continue to have excess liquidity for a while as customers are increasingly opting for non-cash modes of payments.    “The jump in deposits within 10 days of the demonetisation move is positive. Its consequent impact on liquidity, lending rates and money market borrowing costs have helped lower the cost of funding,” Rao said.    “The overall banknote reform should be seen as the government’s move to revisit bilateral investment treaties, tax avoidance efforts, just-concluded IDS    scheme and clampdown on other anti-black money transactions after the passage of a related bill, among others,” she added.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Over-half-of-the-demonetised-notes-are-exchanged-bank-queues-to-ease-soon/articleshow/55574288.cms,

No system has been developed for linking the IT and postal departments for sharing information on demonetisation.    The IT department is finding it difficult to deposit the cash in banks which is seized by the department from various parts of east UP. The banks have their own problems like scarcity of space in their chests to store demonetized notes and also confusion due to differences in directives of finance ministry and Reserve Bank of India on some issues.    These ground realities surfaced when the joint secretary of ministry of health and family welfare Arun Singhal visited Varanasi on Tuesday as representative of the Union government to know the post-demonetization problems being faced by banks, postal department, district administration, farming sector, traders, industrialists and other sections of society. Before leaving for Delhi after holding the series of meetings, Singhal said, ""The purpose of my visit was to know the post-demonetization problems being faced by all these sectors. I have gathered information to prepare my report and submit it to the finance ministry.""    During a meeting, a senior official of the postal department, Visheswarganj office, started making tall claims regarding the facilities provided by the department to exchange demonetized currency. An investigation officer of IT department interrupted and told Singhal that the banks are sharing information about deposits in all accounts and also exchange of demonetized notes on day to day basis. But the postal department is not sharing information regarding deposits made in the banking accounts being operated there.    Singhal was informed by the officials of IT and postal department that no system has been developed for linking these departments for sharing information.    Officials of almost all banks, including SBI, PNB, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and Indian Bank expressed worries due to less cash flow to distribute among customers through their accounts or exchange of demonetized notes. The bank officials told Singhal about the condition of their chests, where no place is left for storing more demonetized notes.    The office-bearers and representatives of traders and industrialists association demanded waiver of interest on the loans taken by the industrialists and traders from the banks till normalization of the market. Fruit and vegetable farmers and traders wanted solution for the problems being faced in making payment to transporters. Much hue and cry raised on the provision of Rs 2.50 lakh withdrawal facility for marriages.    The bankers wanted more clarity in the directive of finance ministry and RBI on this issue. Many of them termed the present conditions in this facility as impractical.

A mason from Ajara, Prakash Kumbhar, has said that work is hard to find as construction activities have come to a halt. ""Individual projects have stopped because of the currency crunch. There is hardly any work, and this is affecting the whole chain of rural economy. The Prime Minister has demanded fifty days for the cash clean-up. But, I dont know how to survive the next fifty days. Our contractors are clueless about the problems we face. They don't have any money to pay advance payments for survival. It is complete chaos.""    Construction workers were hit after the decision came into effect. An expert said that over 80 % of the work force engages in informal sector and the economic transactions are done in cash. The decision of demonetisation has hampered the daily life of these labourers.    Apart from this, exchange counters at banks claim one whole working day adding to the daily-wage labourer's crisis. Labourers are paid only in cash, sometimes in the old demonetised notes as well, forcing them to wait in queues to exchange the currency notes.    Plumber, Datta Gaikwad, said, ""Demonetisation is taking away one day's wage as we have to wait in queue at the bank for an entire day. I earn Rs 450 a day and this is paid in cash. The contractor does not have enough new currency notes, so he pays us using the old currency denominations. I spend two working days in the banks only to exchange these old notes. Many people have also postponed their new projects because of the demonetisation move. It has become difficult to survive. The state has to do something for the common people.""    The general secretory of a construction firm, Shivajai Magdum said, ""The number of construction workers in Kolhapur district numbers over a lakh.

Speculation on another set of decisions post Thursday's review meeting is rife. However, city professionals expect no stringent outcomes. Rather, there are hopes that the government will provide additional relief and extend the validity of scrapped notes at petrol pumps and government-run institutions.    Though there has also been clamour for rollback of the decision in the Parliament, Nagpurians are confident that the government will not shift its stance on the black money. ""I hope there is more relief for farmers and small traders. I also think that banks will start watching the number of transactions carried out by individuals. Promotion of cashless transactions and probable restrictions on cash exchange seem likely,"" says Vinayak Deshpande, an economist in Nagpur University's MBA department.    ""People are allowed to withdraw Rs 25,000 per week, but banks are urging people not to withdraw more than Rs 5,000. The deadline for validity should be extended beyond November 24. For depositing old notes, there should be a one-person, one-time policy,"" says Milind Gadre, founder of a taxi service in the city, who has been accepting cash payment in demonetised notes.    Echoing the sentiment, Daniel Borkar, secretary of Maharashtra Autorickshaw Chalak Sangathan, wants a longer deadline. ""Old notes should be continued since it is clear that the government has not yet printed enough replacement notes. Most passengers give the auto drivers old notes and are disappointed in case the driver refuses to accept it. The driver is not able to give those notes at petrol pumps owing to low fuel capacity of their vehicles and petrol pump owners insist to fill fuel worth whatever the note is offered. Cheques are also getting bounced,"" he says, adding, proper arrangements should have been made first before the announcement.    While most citizens support the government's move on ill-gotten money, they want the government to weed out the inconvenience caused to common man. ""I'm happy to see the Centre announcing GRs to fill loopholes, but sufferings of the common man should be reduced,"" says Daksha Borkar, team leader, Green Vigil Foundation.    ""In principle, there will be no rollback,"" says Kapil Chandra, member of Statutory Development Board for Vidarbha, reiterating that the government should try to ease the procedural inconvenience. Once the phase till December 30 passes, Chandra says, there may be strict focus on gold and real estate sectors.

Most opposition parties participated in the protest in Parliament barring BJD and TRS. In brief proceedings before Lok Sabha was adjourned, some opposition parties demanded a discussion while others insisted on an adjournment motion.    Addressing the media later, I&B minister Venkaiah Naidu said, ""Wapas lena Modiji ke khoon mein nahi hai (rollback is not in Modiji's blood)."" The aggressive stance was reiterated by finance minister Arun Jaitley in a video conference with BJP units where he said the party had no reason to be on the defensive.    The opposition dharna — and a protest led by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Jantar Mantar — also came amid some speculation whether Modi would respond to the protests in Rajya Sabha on Thursday morning where he is expected to be present during question hour relating to the ministries he heads. Though the government sought to offer a discussion under a non-voting rule, both Houses remained deadlocked.    Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi termed the note ban the world's ""biggest impromptu financial experiment"" and claimed that Jaitley and the chief economic adviser were clueless about the announcement.

He was asked why Patel has not made a single public statement and why Das alone was making announcements on the issue.    ""Let's not do these things... For communication purposes, it is irrelevant who addresses. The idea is government should communicate and give out all the information,"" Das said.    Neither Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa nor Anjuly Chib Duggal, Secretary Financial Services - the department in charge of banking operations, have held a press conference on the issue.    Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is issuer of currency and the management of currency is one of its core central banking functions.    The media-shy Patel, who took over from Raghuram Rajan as the Governor of the central in early September, has not made any statement on the management of cash situation after 86 per cent of the currency in circulation was withdrawn and printing of new Rs 2000 and Rs 500 notes begun, leaving Das to do all the fire-fighting.    From the banks' side, SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya has been doing all the talking on recalibration of ATMs and availability of cash.    The November 8 demonetisation decision had sent public at large scrambling to get hold of valid currency notes as bank and ATMs went out of cash.    The All India Bank Officers Confederation has reportedly called for the resignation of Patel for ""utterly failing"" in his role and causing havoc to the nation's economy.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Government-brushes-aside-query-on-Urjit-Patel-keeping-mum/articleshow/55591228.cms,

2016-11-24 04:19:00,Demonetisation: Card transaction charges waived to ease cash blues,"NEW DELHI: State-run banks as well as a few private players have decided to waive transaction charges on debit card payments to ease the cash crunch in the aftermath of the demonetisation decision.    Banks that issue point-of-sale or card swipe machines charge merchants a merchant discount rate. The waiver will be in place till December 31, economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das said.    Other private sector banks are expected to follow suit soon.    Certain service providers, including National Payments Corporation of India, have waived the fee for switching services until December 31. Visa and Mastercard have also agreed to cut the surcharge on debit card purchases till then. ""Public sector banks, some private sector banks and some service providers who provide switching services, have agreed to waive service charges on use of debit cards up to December 31, 2016,"" Das said. The private banks that have allowed the waiver are HDFC, ICICI, Axis and Yes.    TOI had reported on November 21 that the government had asked RBI to nudge banks to cut the merchant charges as a temporary measure until December 31.    Last week, NPCI waived the interchange - the incentive paid by the bank that issues a card swipe machine to the card-issuer bank - on RuPay debit cards until the year-end. NPCI collects 60 paise from card- issuing banks and 30 paise from the bank that issues the swipe machine.    SBI followed up this announcement with a waiver of MDR on RuPay cards. Thou-gh SBI is the largest issuer of RuPay cards and its total debit card transactions account for 25% of sales in India, most of the cards being swiped are those issued by Visa and Mastercard. A large number of the RuPay cards have never even been used at ATMs.    ICICI, HDFC and Axis account for around 37% of India's total debit card transactions, but these are on Visa and Mastercard platform.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Card-transaction-charges-waived-to-ease-cash-blues/articleshow/55591231.cms,
2016-12-27 17:46:00,Demonetisation to be Congress's focus for UP polls,"NEW DELHI:  Demonetisation+  is set to become a campaign issue against BJP, with Congress deciding to seize upon the controversy to kick off the third leg of its mass contact for Uttar Pradesh polls.    The opposition party will 'gherao' the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) office in Kanpur on Friday and the protest will be followed by a public meeting focussed on the troubles faced by common people. The RBI siege and the ensuing offensive will mark the first occasion of demonetisation figuring in electioneering, hitherto limited to protests in Parliament and outside.    The decision to pitchfork the currency ban on the electoral turf conveys a belief in Congress and the larger opposition that demonetisation, which found tremendous support among people as a measure to curb black money, had a dimension of public inconvenience which could be tapped. Importantly, it indicates that Congress may use the post-currency ban crunch in the rest of its state campaign.    The Kanpur show will be the start of the third phase of Congress's campaign after Rahul Gandhi's 26-day 'Deoria to Delhi' yatra and 'Rahul Sandesh Yatra' carried out by special raths and local leaders in districts. To revive its stalled campaign, Congress sources said the party would organise public rallies at district level to be held by state leaders. After Kanpur, the show will move to Bahraich, and is likely to take in Gorakhpur and Varanasi among other places.    Sources said the rallies would target an audience of 15,000 people and bigger attendance would be sought when Rahul later enters the fray as the main speaker.    The party has decided to mainly target BJP, instead of SP and BSP, as Rahul did during his 26-day yatra, and the note ban provides another opportunity to amplify the pitch against the Modi government.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-to-be-Congresss-focus-for-UP-polls/articleshow/55591200.cms,

While in Trichy, joint secretary to the government of India Praveen Kumar held a meeting with farmers and traders, in Coimbatore, M Janaki, deputy secretary from the ministry of urban development, interacted with industrial associations and bank officials to study the extent of implementation of demonetisation and its impact.

TN Federation of Traders' Associations president A M Vikrama Raja, in a statement, said if the Centre didn't pay heed to their demands, the trader bodies will indefinitely shut shops as a sign of protest. In Trichy , farmers ex pressed serious concern at their plight while handling agriculture activities in the delta region. ""The central government announced that farmers can withdraw `25,000 from the banks for spending on fertilizer, pesticide, seeds and labour. The reality is that no farmer is allowed to withdraw more than `2,000 from the rural banks.

On their part, managers of several nationalised banks who attended the meeting expressed concern at the delay in getting the new currency notes from Reserve Bank of India.

2016-11-24 13:52:00,Shrimp growers face brunt of demonetisation,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The paucity of lower currency denominations has hit shrimp farmers in north Andhra and Godavari districts. In view of the shortage, shrimp growers are finding it difficult to buy feed for cultivation and also pay labourers.    In the two Godavari districts, shrimp is cultivated on 1.2 lakh acres. In north Andhra, the area under cultivation is below 3,000 acres. Vizag district has only 1,500 acres, Vizianagaram has only 100 acres and Srikakulam has around 1,000 acres under shrimp culture.    ""Even if we export the yield, the traders are not paying. And to make matters worse, if they deposit the money in the banks, we are unable to withdraw it to clear our debts,"" a farmer of Narasapuram in West Godavari Ch. Rama Naidu said.    Yield from around 20,000 acres in the five districts is ready for export with 20 pieces of shrimp being priced at Rs 660. ""We have already borrowed lakhs for the feed and pesticides. If we do not sell the material immediately, there are possibilities of virus attack. If that happens, we will lose the entire amount,"" another farmer of Sakhinetipalli area Kurella Ramachandra Rao said.    On an average, both Godavari districts export Rs 2,500 crore worth of shrimp, 90 per cent of which is the Vannamei variety, per year.    Demand for shrimp from America, Singapore and Gulf countries soars in December and January in view of Christmas and New Year celebrations. As per market estimates, this season, exports would touch Rs 1,400 crore. Joint director of fisheries department of Vizag V Venkateswara Rao told TOI that a small group of growers are facing severe problems as they are not getting loans. Earlier, they used to get the feed and pesticide on credit.    ""At present, there is also a demand for small shrimps with 100 pieces fetching a good price. This is the time we can earn profits. With demonetisation, the purchase capacity has come down. We lost the first crop due to virus and though the yield was not high in this second crop, we were hoping to overcome the losses but have received a setback due to demonetisation,"" Rama Naidu said.    Those who have leased their land to big businessmen are now facing another problem as they are not getting the lease amount from the tenants. Tenant farmers in the delta areas in the Godavari districts cultivate shrimp in 30 to 150 acres area.

2016-11-24 06:00:00,The positive effects of demonetisation,"Demonetisation has thrown our lives off track for sure. But the cash crunch hasn't really brought the demon out in any of us. Far from it, apna city folk are discovering that demonetisation has had some rather heart-warming side effects. From the neighbourhood grocer who freely gives out essentials on loan to the restaurant cashier who writes you a pay-when-you-can receipt when your card shows ""error"", Hyderabad seems to be filled with stories that make the city seem like one large, happy — even if sometimes grumpy — family.    Hyderabad Times listens in as some city folk tell us how life in the city has changed. And we can help but say hallelujah!  Girls are feeling safe at ATMS even in the middle of the night  My friend and I were completely out of cash. Since our mornings start early, we decided to go out to check for an ATM late in the night. Of course, being girls, the thoughts of safety did cross our minds. But we had no choice. We found one ATM with a long queue and lined up, still nervous. We were the only two girls there. With a long line ahead of us, we knew it would take us at least 40 minutes to get our cash. But soon, we realised that there was nothing to worry about. We felt safe. in fact, we felt like we were part of the same family standing there. There was no staring, no comments, all the banter was about the problems, the pros or the cons of demonetisation. For once, it seemed like a gender-neutral world, where more important things were happening. If Gandhiji was alive today, I guess he would be happy that women are finally able to walk out in the middle of the night (laughs).    — Anisha D, marketing professional  Trust in humanity restored  I went to a restaurant the other day for dinner. Since I had not more than `40 in cash, I'd made sure to go there since I knew I could pay by card. A a hearty dinner later, the bill arrived and I handed my card over only to be told that the card machine was not working. It was peak hour of transactions and there was some technical snag. I was dumbstruck, wondering how I'd pay up when they calmly told me to write down my name and number on the bill and come back and pay whenever I could. It made me think. If it wasn't for this inconvenience we have been put through, we would never bother to place our trust in another human being. I left with a smile on my face.    — Subhash Nemagowda, techie  Neighbourhood heroes are saving the day  For the first one week after the demonetisation of 500 and 1000, I was literally walking around with no cash in my pocket. During that time, I discovered that there was this one grocer near my house where everyone seemed to be going. When I went closer, I realised what the reason was. The shop keeper was giving out groceries on loan. Of course, he was keeping a record of all of the transactions, which is basically taking down people's names and phone numbers, that's all. But then it requires some amount of trust to do that, right? I was relieved that I could also replenish the few groceries I needed to get back to cooking at home, instead of ordering meals online or buying food on credit card, which means I have to spend at least 200 on each meal! He even offered me hand loan if I have any urgent need! Having such people around your neighbourhood helps you sleep better at night. — Sajeesh Rajendran, professional  Strangers have begun talking to each other again like the good old days  I miss those days when we were nice to each other, you know. We wouldn't think twice about striking up a conversation with anyone. But thanks to social media, we are constantly connected with 'friends' virtually; no one even looks at a stranger, let alone say hello. Over the past week though, I have noticed this new-found bonhomie between people. From ATM queues to banks, everywhere I go, I see people striking a conversation with each other. 'This queue is endless, right?' someone says, they shake their heads together and that's it, the ice is broken! Of the many new people I met, I remember Devika, who was in her 50s, struggling to stand in the queue. We shared some light banter, and she later told me how it helped her take her mind off the queue.

""Instead of wasting the Parliament's time through blind opposition, the leaders should involve in a healthy debate over the issue. No discussion are being held on the topics in the agenda. Nearly Rs 10 crore is spent for each Parliament session, and leaders cannot waste public money by not discussing issues relating to public welfare,"" he said.

How can there be financial improvement when there is such massive corruption taking place in the country?,"" he questioned.

2016-11-24 09:36:00,"Infosys, Flipkart, M&M among others go all out to help staff tide over demonetisation crisis","MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: From currency note conversion desks to mobile ATMs and temporary cash withdrawal counters, India Inc. is going all out to help its employees tide over the cash crunch after the government made high-denomination notes illegal two weeks ago.    The sudden invalidation of 86% of India’s currency by value, along with curbs on withdrawals from bank accounts and ATMs and on exchange of old notes, made cash scarce and resulted in long queues outside banks every day.    To help meet the cash needs of their employees, companies, including Infosys, Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, Yatra-.com, Mahindra & Mahindra, Godrej, EY, Vodafone, Ericsson India, Chaayos and Marico, have been proactive since November 8, more so as the end of the month approaches and the next salary cycle starts.    What companies have done, broadly, is bring banking facilities to the office premises and switch to cashless modes of transactions such as plastic currency and mobile or digital wallets. These apart, they have been generous with time off for staff. Ecommerce giant Flipkart, based in Bengaluru, has tied up with a bank to set up desks at its offices where old notes can be swapped for new, in accordance with RBI guidelines. The facility has been used by more than 60% of the employees. “This provision was also availed by office support staff as they would need it the most,” said a Flipkart spokesperson.    The Godrej Group partnered with ICICI Bank to set up a currency exchange desk at its headquarters in the Mumbai suburb of Vikhroli on November 15. All Godrej employees could exchange old notes with official identity documents. ATMs on its premises were upgraded to dispense new currency notes.    “We host two ATM machines at our headquarters in Mumbai. They were recalibrated and replenished with the official currency on November 10, which has been very useful,” said Sumit Mitra, head-group human resources and corporate services at Godrej.    Axis Bank, where several top companies have their salary accounts, said it is organising micro-ATMs for employees of Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Infosys, among other private and public sector companies.    Companies are granting employees leave to go to banks, providing advances to those travelling on work, organising sessions to educate staff on mobile wallets and making in-house vendor transactions cashless.    Infosys and Chaayos are encouraging employees to use smart cards and digital wallets. MakeMyTrip is telling staff to bill their travel expenses, including tickets, to the company so that they don’t incur any expenditure on their own. “We have had sessions to educate the staff on mobile wallets so that they can use them more. All our inhouse cafe transactions have been moved to Paytm,” said Ripudaman Gill, head of human resources at Chaayos.    Infosys is working closely with multiple service providers and most of the ATMs on its campuses have been recalibrated to dispense new notes. The IT company has started a token system in its office premises to reduce time spent standing in ATM queues, said Richard Lobo, head of HR. All its ATMs are replenished at regular intervals to cater to about 25,000 employees in Bengaluru. There are 10 ATMs in the 50 Infosys buildings located in the city. The country’s second-largest software services company has embarked on a zero-cash model at its food courts. “We are also exploring the option of installing micro-ATMs via certain service providers,” said Lobo.    “Employees are asking for time-off for going to banks. So, we don’t have a problem with them taking leave for that. We are allowing them to take leave as and when they need to for this,” said Sharat Dhall, president of travel portal Yatra.com. Additionally, Yatra is giving advances to those travelling on work so that they don’t have to spend their own cash, he said. Companies agree that apart from meeting the immediate cash needs of their employees, such measures ensure that the staff don’t have to stand in serpentine queues to withdraw cash during office hours, which could affect productivity.  Vodafone India, the country’s second-largest telecom company, is educating employees about its M-Pesa app, which enables cash withdrawal from select M-Pesa stores, apart from setting up cash withdrawal counters at its premises.    All vendors within Vodafone offices are now M-Pesa-enabled. Employees can load their M-Pesa wallets with debit or credit cards and use them. “All our employees have appreciated this initiative as they have found an alternative to skip long ATM queues. In some offices, we have set up cashout counters to assist employees withdraw cash through M-Pesa,” said a company spokesperson.    EY, one of the Big 4 audit firms, said it plans to continue with kiosks and mobile ATMs at periodic intervals across its offices. “This will make sure that a maximum number of our people can benefit from this facility in the office premises,” said Sandeep Kohli, national director of human resources.    Telecom company MTS India installed its first on-premises ATM at its corporate office in New Delhi. The company had requested the facility about two months ago and by expediting efforts after the demonetisation was announced, was able to get the ATM installed on November 10.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Infosys-Flipkart-MM-among-others-go-all-out-to-help-staff-tide-over-demonetisation-crisis/articleshow/55593460.cms,

Manmohan Vaidya, All India Prachar Pramukh (national spokesperson) and considered number four in the Sangh hierarchy, told ET that post-demonetisation “anti- national, separatist and terrorist activities in the country seem to have come to a sudden halt, resulting in restoration of normalcy in Kashmir Valley after a long time.”    RSS Deputy Prachar Pramukh (media in-charge) J Nandakumar said there were no orders from the RSS leadership to its members on the demonetization move but sangh members feel morally responsible to assist people at a time like this. ""The ordinary people understand the importance of this fight. Unfortunately, only some intellectuals and a section of media are against it.""    ""Our members like many others are providing tea and water to people standing in queues, helping senior citizens get to the counter fast and assisting people in filling out forms. Some of us are also talking to people about the benefits of the move and how it is in national interest, apart from identifying poor families in bastis and help them get valid currency,"" he said.    Top RSS leaders said that the Sangh has had several meetings of its senior pracharaks since demonetisation was announced on November 8. Some of these meetings were forums where concerns of RSS members were addressed, and some meetings involved representatives of several small and medium traders associations.    Sangh-affiliated organisations like the Swadesh Jagran Manch (SJM) were also spoke to by senior RSS leaders. ""We have welcomed the move but we want the use of Rupay (an Indian card payment platform), to grow."" said Ashwani Mahajan, National Co-convener, SJM.    RSS leaders told ET the Sangh sees demonetisation as a step in a plan that started with opening bank accounts for everyone (Jan Dhan) and will end with big bang electoral reform. ""We all know that the election process is the root cause of black money. The PM is already talking about one nation, one election”, Prafulla Ketkar, editor of RSS-inspired Organiser magazine, said.    He said the Sangh should work to ensure there’s “no panic at this stage” because “panic will hurt future reforms”.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-RSS-reaches-out-to-public-preaches-Modis-money-mantra/articleshow/55593377.cms,

Prior to November 8, the day PM Modi announced withdrawal of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes as legal tenders, average daily cash transported across the country was between Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore. Although the Reserve Bank of India and  cash logistics+  companies declined to share the value of currency notes being supplied to banks and post offices around the country, bankers put the figure at about a fourth to a fifth of the pre-demonetisation days.  Supply of currency+  had fallen drastically after November 8, but with each passing day, it is picking up pace, bankers said.    The situation is better in metros where about 25% or more of the daily cash requirement is currently being met. In non-metro areas, the corresponding figure is much lower, they said. The main hurdles in meeting the demand for cash has been choked supply of currency notes from RBI and inability of ATMs to dispense cash as not all of them have been recalibrated to dispense the new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Only-25-of-daily-cash-demand-being-met/articleshow/55609931.cms,

Half-a-dozen sex workers, who travel to Panaji from Vasco every day in search of clients, while appreciating the government's decision said their business has dwindled since the demonization move. While theirs is a hand-to-mouth existence, the last few days have been even harder with few or no customers, they said.    Shilpa (name changed), who is in her forties, expressed her worry about having to return home empty-handed as she had not one client since morning. ""I did not go to eat lunch, as I didn't want to miss customers,"" Shilpa, who also works for an NGO, said.    Savita, another sex worker had a similar worry, but she did not curse the government for her plight. ""Well! We will have to bear with it for a few more days,"" she said with a smile.    Procurers operating along the North Goa beach belt, though, have found a way to work around the situation. When TOI approached some of them for the story, one was ready to ""arrange girls"" within minutes and said that debit cards could be used to make payments and could be swiped at a restaurant that was willing to offer cash in exchange. The procurer affirmed that demonetization had not had much impact on their business.    Sex-workers coming to Panaji, who have not hit on the idea as yet, are feeling the pinch of the demonitization move and left them cash strapped.    One 29-year-old sex worker, who shared that on normal days her average daily income is around 1,000, said that the last few days have been lean. The woman, who visits the capital city at least three times a week, said, ""Today, I had only one customer."" She was upset that she would likely not have any more customers for rest of the day.    ""My husband is a drunkard and I have two kids to look after,"" she said, and added that she worked as a maid till she was pushed into the business a few years ago, after which it has been her source of her income. ""After getting married to the wrong man, my happier times ended,"" she said nonchalantly.    This is the first time, they say their business has been affected this badly. Are they worried?

""Singh is famous for his sophisticated language, his soft-spokenness. He is a true Gandhian who offers the other cheek. So, his unusually harsh words today mean that something has gone terribly wrong with demonetisation. Else, he would not have used those words,"" leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters.

In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Centre pointed out the positive impact of  demonetisation+  and said its decision would put the economy on a high growth path that would create more jobs and make housing in urban areas affordable to the poor.    It said an estimated 22.4 lakh pieces of fake Rs 1,000 notes were in circulation in 2014-15 while the number of counterfeit Rs 500 notes were around 37.5 lakh.    The Centre said it has adopted a ""multi-pronged and calibrated approach"" to eradicate black money and promote cashless transactions and  demonetisation+  is a step in that direction.    ""The withdrawal of existing high denomination bank notes will curb funding of terrorists. It will eliminate black money which casts long shadow of the parallel economy on our real economy. The poor and middle class, who are worst sufferers due to black money, will be benefited. It will help reduce tax avoidance and bring more transactions into the formal economy,"" it said.    ""Transborder terrorism, Left-wing extremism and domestic terrorism are being funded by black money. High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and are known to facilitate generation and hoarding of black money,"" the Centre said.    It said hostile intelligence agencies, a clear reference to Pakistan's ISI, have not only been pumping in huge amount of fake Indian notes to finance terrorist groups and their operations in the country but also printing fake currency in large number to destabilise the nation.    Responding to the court's query on action taken by it to bring relief to the people facing problem due to cash crunch, the government said a high-level committee is monitoring the situation on a day-to-day basis and appropriate decisions were being taken to ensure that no one suffered due to the move.    ""The exercise of replacement of old notes by way of exchange and deposit is being carried out on a large scale and involves 1.30 lakh bank branches, 1.5 lakh post offices, one lakh banking correspondents and 2.01 lakh ATMs. Further there are 14,43,595 points of sale (POS) which are online and the total number of outstanding cards is 2,59,43,784,"" the government said in its affidavit.    ""There is excessive use of cash in the real estate sector due to large cash transactions in purchase of land and housing property. The real estate prices get pushed up artificially. This reduces the availability of affordable housing for the poor and the middle class. Greater over the board transactions will lead to a decline in real estate prices making housing affordable to all,"" it said.    ""A thrust has been made for increasing the digital payments in the economy through credit and debit cards, internet banking, mobile apps and e-wallets.

Reminding the government that 90% of the workforce was in the informal sector and 55% of those in agriculture were in distress, Singh said, ""These measures convince me that the way the scheme has been implemented, it is a monumental management failure and, in fact, it is a case of organised loot and legalised plunder of the common people.""

2016-11-25 12:54:00,Demonetisation move sows seeds of political realignment,"KOLKATA: Some have cheered the move, some swear at it, but nobody can ignore it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an agenda that may upset the given political equations. Mamata Banerjee was the first to up the ante, and finally as many as 16 opposition parties are now on the same page. And like many moves in politics, Mamata could make the Prime Minister agree to allow the use of old Rs 500 notes till December 15. On the other hand, the Bengal CM isn't likely to have Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar by her side on this issue.    Back home, the clout of BJP is on the rise in Bengal as polls since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections indicate and Mamata is aware of it. She is thus trying at a counter-polarisation when Modi aims at unsettling the vote banks of opposition parties. Trinamool leaders held protest rallies all across the state — Kolkata, Howrah, Canning, Siliguri, Midnapore, Jhargram and Raiganj — when the CM was in Delhi. There will now be a slew of rallies and dharnas that the city will witness till November 30. The chief minister will lead the agitation in Kolkata on November 28 when opposition parties across the country observe a ""protest day"". The Bengal BJP isn't far behind. It has already started holding meetings across the state over how Mamata is trying to ""divert attention from her chit fund misdeeds"".    The Left is also desperate to gain the opposition space in Bengal. Left Front chairman Biman Bose has announced a week-long agitation from November 24 to 30 to protect its support base. However, the BJP's rise in Bengal politics may further wean away the Congress and Left support among minorities, who will rally behind Mamata. CPM activists apart, a section of CPM supporters also seem happy with the Prime Minister's move. They welcome the move from their rabid anti-Mamata stance. They believe that the scrapping of old notes will destroy the ""reserve of black money"" that the ruling Trinamool has amassed through chit fund scams.    Taking it forward, Modi has also gained new support among the middle income and low income groups who are frustrated with the corruption and extortions. The opposition, on the other hand, wants to cash in on the distress among the daily wage earners to take on BJP. Mamata does it by throwing up a stir at Jantar Mantar, while CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury does it within the Rajya Sabha precincts.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Demonetisation-move-sows-seeds-of-political-realignment/articleshow/55608125.cms,kolkata

Among the seniors who braved the crowds were Simrat Kaur and her husband. Standing in the line at the Bank of Baroda at Nirman Vihar, Kaur said, ""Both my children have spent long hours to get money exchanged.

He accepted that the people had grievances about the banks, but said ""the public's cooperation is making it easier for us to function"".    Not many customers were entirely happy though. Rinku Khan, a 26-year-old employee of an east Delhi transport company, cradled his 8-month-old daughter in a queue outside a bank in old Delhi. His wife stood in a line at another bank. ""I was frustrated trying to get money at several banks near my home. Someone told me the crowd would be lesser here, but it's not so."" Banks across south Delhi ran out of cash by noon.

2016-11-25 07:26:00,Demonetisation impact to be over by FY17: SBI chief,"COIMBATORE: The impact of demonetisation on the economy would be over by the end of the current financial year, State Bank of India (SBI) chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya has said. ""We definitely hope so and see no reason why not. The demand is still there in the market,"" she said in response to a TOI query on whether the economy would get back to normal mode by the end of 2016-17.    ""In any value chain, the last link is mostly cash. There has been slowdown in the off-take of goods because cash has not been immediately available. But the fact is -this is temporary in nature—the demand exists in the country,"" she said on the sidelines of SBI's corporate social responsibility event here on Thursday. ""Because the demand is still there, people will readjust their models, come back and do their business as they were earlier,"" the SBI chief stated.    While about 60% of the ATMs of SBI, which has the largest network in the country, have been recalibrated to dispense the new currency notes, the rest would be done in five days, she informed. Only 10%-15% of the currency being exchanged and deposited in bank accounts after the demonetisation will eventually remain with banks, Arundhati said. About Rs. 1.2 lakh crore was deposited with SBI in the fortnight after demonetisation was announced.    ""The amount that is coming into the bank will not remain fully with the bank. We expect around 10%-15% of it to remain in the bank. The rest will have to go back because they were working in the economy,"" she said. ""It may not go out as cash but as transfer transactions because this was working capital in the economy. Only that amount which was lying idle in people's cupboards or something will stay with the bank,"" she quipped.    Stating that there would be a reduction in lending rates, she said that demonetisation has got nothing to do with the recapitalisation of banks, which have seen a surge in NPAs (non-performing assets). ""The revenue income of the government will go up,"" Arundhati said.    The NPA levels of banks however would see a temporary spike as the business done by them would fall due to demonetisation, she said. ""The topline has shrunk and if the topline shrinks, the NPA numbers as a percentage will go up,"" the SBI chief pointed out. ""This is especially so this quarter and more so in the next,"" she said. ""During this period our people have also been very busy and (have) not been able to focus so much on loan disbursal,"" she stated.    The SBI chief said that there has been a quantum jump in digital transactions—300% surge in numbers and 200% increase in value terms—with wallet downloads going up by 100% for the bank ever since demonetisation was announced. SBI is installing 3600 PoS (point of sale) machines at toll plazas after demonetisation, she said. ""The Bombay Doctors' Association has requested us for 650 PoS machines,"" she informed.    SBI has been giving 'Imprest' cards to corporates to help them make low value payments to workers. The bank has also deployed 841 mobile ATMs that deliver cash at places such as hospitals and vegetable markets.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-impact-to-be-over-by-FY17-SBI-chief/articleshow/55611150.cms,
2016-11-25 10:57:00,Currency demonetisation: ‘Why exemption for only marriage and not death?’,"71-year-old, who lost his wife last week, wonders why the Rs 2.5 lakh withdrawal limit does not apply to those like him who have to pay for the elaborate rituals following the death of a loved one.    Professor Amarnath Agrawal, a 71-year-old scientist from Kanjurmarg is grieving - his wife Draupadi passed away following a cardiac arrest on November 19. But apart from mourning her loss and planning her final rituals, Agrawal has another big worry to add to his list of woes - demonetisation.    The retired Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) scientist is worried how to will meet the cash requirement for the elaborate religious rituals between the tenth and twelfth day of his wife's death, which he expects will cost nearly Rs 2.5 lakh.    While the government has set a Rs 2.5 lakh withdrawal limit for weddings, there is no such exemption for those suffering a death in the family. ""I just want our politicians to realise that just like a marriage ceremony, even rituals following death are a serious business and have to be given special attention,"" Agrawal told Mumbai Mirror at his residence. ""While marriage expenses can be scaled down, expenses in case of death cannot be,"" added the father of three.    Draupadi, who was suffering from chronic renal failure, was cremated last Saturday after neighbours at Mahavir Trinkets Society pooled in money and made payments for the crematorium, to pay priests, hire an ambulance, etc.    Despite this, the IIT-Bombay alumnus, currently a pensioner, who runs a study centre at Matunga East, claims to be happy with Prime Minister Modi's demonetisation exercise. The septuagenarian has already tweeted to PM Modi's Twitter handle regarding his request, but has not heard from him.    Agrawal had visited Canara Bank's Kanjurmarg branch with an application to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh and a doctor's letter certifying his wife's death. ""The branch manager is a dear friend. But he says he is helpless till the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issues necessary guidelines,"" Agrawal said.    Given the weekly withdrawal limits set by RBI, Agrawal managed to withdraw Rs 48,000 from the two accounts he holds. ""The bank staffers were kind enough to understand my plight and give me the money. There are many who have been unable to withdraw even the allowed limit because some banks don't have the money,"" he said.    Expanding on the expenditure on funeral rituals, Agrawal said, ""For the tenth day rituals, the temple at Mulund is not in a position to accept card payments or cheque. For the twelfth day ceremony, 12 Brahmins will have to be fed and given dakshina (donation).""    Given the customs that the Agrawals follow, one of the most important ceremonies after the Asthi Visarjan , Pind daan and Gau daan is Shaiya Daan. ""Those who wish the departed well make gifts of articles according to their ability. The soul shall be pleased thereby having its basic needs satisfied, similar to when it was alive in the physical form,"" Agrawal informed.    Accordingly, Agrawal needs to purchase silver ware, food stuff, clothes, new beds, etc which he will have to gift the 12 Brahmins. ""In return, the purohit gives an equal amount of blessings to each one in order to lead their lives with peace, happiness and prosperity,"" Agrawal said.    EXCHANGE OF OLD NOTES STOPPED    » No more over-the-counter exchange of old Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes; this is to encourage people ""who are still unbanked, to open new bank accounts""    » Rs 1,000 notes will no longer be allowed to be used for the list of exemptions the government has announced (list below)    SOME PLACES YOU CAN USE OLD RS 500 NOTES TILL DECEMBER 15    » Government hospitals    » Pharmacies, to buy medicines with doctor's prescription    » At railway ticketing counters, bus ticket counters of government or PSUs and airline counters at airports for purchase of tickets    » For purchase of petrol, diesel and gas at state-run oil companies    » At crematoria and burial grounds    » At international airports for passengers up to Rs 5,000    » To buy LPG gas cylinders    » For metro rail tickets    » At monuments maintained by ASI",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Why-exemption-for-only-marriage-and-not-death/articleshow/55611737.cms,mumbai

2016-11-25 13:23:00,Demonetisation: Jewellers 'recycle' old currency,"HYDERABAD: If some people with unaccounted money are busy transferring funds into Jan Dhan Yojana accounts of others, gold traders are routing the demonetised currency into accounts of dubious clients to evade the tax radar.    The modus operandi: A gold trader first creates a dubious record book in which he shows he has made a payment to a client, who sold his old ornaments for recycling. The dubious client then deposits the amount in his bank account. The explanation for the deposit is that the money was made out of selling old ornaments before denomination.    The dummy client claims that he got the money after selling old ornaments, which were part of family legacy. As the ornaments were bought many decades ago he does not have the receipt. According to K Keshav, a CA, this money recycling practice has been going on in the gold market to avoid the demonetisation blues.    The dummy client after some days will return money to traders after deducting his cut. This is shown as sale of gold to the same person by the trader post demonetisation. In fact, gold never changes hands. It exists only in the records. All transactions are adjusted in accounts books.    In many areas traders are accepting old currency for gold at a premium of 20% to 30%, said sources with an idea of the grey market.

The bag was discovered near Mangala Theatre, at a spot close to a public sector bank, around 5.30pm on Wednesday. Local residents said many passers-by had made off with several currency notes before Nikhil Thorat and Akash Waghmare took the bag to the Shivajinagar police station.    The police took possession of the bag and counted the notes, which were in a good condition. A senior officer told TOI that they have made a station diary entry and are waiting for the cash to be claimed.

2016-11-25 10:53:00,"Demonetisation: Bank branches in Delhi, Mumbai run out of cash as focus turns to rural areas","MUMBAI: Banks in Mumbai and Delhi ran out of cash within hours of opening on Thursday with currency supplies having dwindled to a sixth of requirements in some instances as the government battled opposition-led criticism of the manner in which the withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes had been handled.    “The way the scheme has been implemented, it's a monumental management failure,” former prime minister Manmohan Singh told Parliament, adding that the move may lead to growth slipping by two percentage points or more. A truckers’ union said the shortage of cash was making it difficult to keep vehicles operating and may bring the transport of goods by road to a halt.    Executives estimated that banks in Mumbai only got Rs 25 crore of the Rs 150 crore required and those in the National Capital Region got a similar amount of Rs 130 crore they needed. State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank got the bulk of the currency supplied, they said.    “We are facing shortfall on a daily basis,” said an executive at a non-state bank. “Today we were expecting the daily quota but that hasn’t come till now.”    This comes as the government has called for a shift in focus to rural areas, where the economy is almost entirely cash-based.    This was after the situation appeared to have eased in the country’s biggest cities. “Cash supply is restricted,” said another banker. “We have to manage the branch, the ATM and now additional rural requirements in this limited amount of cash.”    However, top State Bank of India officials said there had been no decline in the supply of notes by Reserve Bank of India since November 8, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the initiative as part of his battle against black money, corruption, counterfeit notes and terror financing. The situation has been exacerbated by people holding on to currency for fear it will run out, the bankers said.    “What we have noticed is that there is a tendency among small businessmen and even individuals to hoard small-denomination notes. As a result, the circulation of notes is not happening,” said one of those cited above. “Further, close to Rs 6 lakh crore of invalid notes have been deposited with banks but RBI and government have not printed as many notes. Therefore, some shortage will continue.”    Finance Minister Arun Jaitley countered the former prime minister’s criticism, saying that “the maximum black money was generated during 2004-14 as well as the period was engulfed in various scams like 2G and coal scam”, referring to the term of the government led by Singh. “We are not surprised that they did not like the anti-black money measures the government has taken... Those who did not consider the generation of so much black money and scams during their regime as blunders are now finding the crusade against black money as a blunder.”    RBI had said on November 11 that there was enough cash with banks and “all arrangements have been made to reach the currency notes all over the country”, reiterating the message two days later. It had assured the public that enough cash in small denominations was available with it and the banks. In the 15 days since the move, RBI has not issued any official data on the quantum of new currency it has so far released into the system. RBI did not respond to an email seeking information on the matter.    An RBI official said that Rs 2,000 notes are being printed by the RBI’s printing press at Mysore, while the new Rs 500 notes are being printed at the government’s printing presses at Nashik and Dewas, over which the central bank has no control.    The smaller denomination notes are especially in short supply. RBI has said the presses are running at full capacity so that enough notes are available. Some experts have said that the shortfall can only be made up by May next year. RBI had said earlier that notes had been stocked at more than 4,000 currency chests across the country. They are meant to supply bank branches linked to them.    Banks said RBI will have to address the note shortage soon. “Currency supply is avery big issue,” said a banker. “There is a genuine problem on the supply itself because they have a capacity problem on production and that will take time undoubtedly.”    Some said the currency distribution seems to have been lopsided. “You will see that southern parts of India have excess supply while western and northern parts have faced issues with currency movement,” one banker said. “Some of this will get fixed over the course of the next few weeks.”    Several bank branches in the metros wore a deserted look on Thursday. “We cannot say currency is in abundant supply… last-mile connectivity will always be a problem,” a banker said. “There is a huge movement of currency, it cannot happen in the normal course. Definitely banks are facing some challenges.”",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Bank-branches-in-Delhi-Mumbai-run-out-of-cash-as-focus-turns-to-rural-areas/articleshow/55613861.cms,
2016-11-25 10:58:00,"Demonetisation: Currency recall could cost India a massive Rs 1.28 lakh crore, says CMIE","NEW DELHI: The cost of withdrawing high-denomination currency notes to wipe out black money from the country will be about Rs 1.28 lakh crore during the 50-day window till December 30, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said.    The overall cost could be much higher, the private economy watcher estimated. The demonetisation invalidated 86% of the Rs 17.8 lakh crore of currency that was in circulation on October 28. “A steady stream of news reports of empty mandis, low footfalls at malls and drop in business in restaurants, stressed factories paint a grim picture of the effects of a sudden withdrawal of liquidity from markets,” CMIE said in a report on Thursday.    Emphasising that all estimates are conservative and limited to the 50-day window, CMIE said the government and the Reserve Bank of India are estimated to bear a cost of Rs 16,800 crore, largely on account of printing new currency notes and transporting them to banks, ATMs and post offices.    CMIE said businesses are expected to pay the biggest price of the demonetisation, which became effective on November 9, and the immediate impact could be about Rs 61,500 crore, or 48% of the total cost of the exercise.    “We estimate the direct impact on business in terms of the drop in discretionary spending by households. This alone adds up to more than half a trillion rupees during the 50-day period till end of December,” it said. After enterprises, the other big sector to get hit is banks, which, according to CMIE, “lose a lot more.”    Wage levels of bankers are higher than those of the average person in the queue and banks suffer overheads and operational costs in terms of recalibrating ATMs to dispense new notes. “Banks would do little else during this 50-day period and we estimate that they would bear a cost of Rs 35,100 crore,” it said.      Also Read:    Unaccounted deposits post demonetisation likely to attract up to 60% tax  People standing in queues to exchange or deposit old currency notes bear 12% of the total cost and could lose Rs 15,000 crore in foregone wages during the period. The long-term impact could be more, CMIE said.    “All estimates are admittedly conservative. All estimates are limited to the 50-day window. However, the impact of low liquidity, broken supply chains and loss of confidence in consumers is likely to impact the economy over a longer period,” CMIE said.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Currency-recall-could-cost-India-a-massive-Rs-128-lakh-crore-says-CMIE/articleshow/55613970.cms,

Thanks to demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, the windfall came the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) way. From November11 to 25, the civic body was able to mop one-fourth of yearly collection as people queued up to pay their property tax and other utility bills.    According to BMC revenue in-charge Pradeep Verma, around Rs 26 crore had been paid in form of property tax, water tax and other cess to the BMC. Some 15% of taxes were from defaulters, who had been delaying payment to the civic body for years. Tax collection for the civic body in last fiscal touched Rs 117 crore.    As per initial analysis, BMC receipts in November 2015 stood at Rs 3.5 crore. Civic body topped its previous tax collection records for this time of the year. An estimated 85,000 people and commercial establishments paid their bills from November 11 to 24.    Property tax, during first two quarters, the revenue collection has been about Rs 112 crore. From April to July, around Rs 30 crore was collected. In second quarter, Rs 82 crore was collected, much of which was due to the demonetisation.    Target for BMC for property tax, water tax and other utilities is set at Rs 120 crore for the current fiscal.    Cash registers have not stopped ringing from around November 11 after the Centre allowed citizens to pay arrears for essential services with demonetised currency.    ""Hundreds have preferred to pay their taxes through demonetarised currency notes. Old notes will be accepted through till mid-night on Thursday,"" Verma said.    The unprecedented tax payment collection has come as a big help for the BMC, which had to delay salary payment for its contractual employees at the beginning of the month, ahead of Diwali.    Over last four years, helped by computerisation of tax collection, BMC tax revenues registered an increase of around 200%, he said.    GIS-backed survey of civic tax defaulters and illegal construction or expansion of property, is likely to increase the civic body collection by an estimated Rs 50 crore, according to estimates. The civic body will spend around Rs 4.5 crore on the GIS survey. It is part of the its smart city project. Around one lakh properties in Bhopal as per 2015 estimates evade municipal taxes.

The Congress has alleged that there have been over 70 deaths related to demonetisation in the past 15 days. The party members are now arguing that since the house adopted the proposal, it signifies that there is a feeling in the BJP that the decision to demonetize higher denomination notes was ""ill-conceived and pathetically executed"".    Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not commented on the deaths in queues and the BJP has been aggressively defending demonetization and denying such deaths.    The leader of the house, Subhash Arya, began with a proposal to mourn the death of people in the UP train accident and offer condolences to the jawans martyred in the militant attacks in Kashmir. Following Suri's written proposal, Arya announced that the House would also mourn the deaths in queues outside banks and ATMs. The councillors, including the mayor, Shyam Sharma, then observed two minutes of silence.    ""I call it demonization, and not demonetization,"" said Suri. ""Several people have lost their lives in long queues. I moved the proposal to mourn the deaths and express condolences to the bereaved families."" He urged the central government to take effective steps so that people do not die in these queues.    ""The BJP also feels that the decision was ill-conceived and pathetically executed. Mourning those who died in the queues by the BJP councillors suggests this,"" said Abhishek Dutt, a Congress councillor. Delhi Congress spokesperson Sharmista Mukherjee, however, was unimpressed. ""People are starving in the countryside. The poor are being exploited, but PM Modi is silent. He is turning a blind eye to the plight of the poor. The BJP leaders in south corporation are shedding crocodile tears,"" she said.    Mayor Sharma, who was in the chair, defended the mourning. ""When people die in any incident, we mourn the death since we are are human. But like the entire country, we are in support of demonetization.""

""The Congress is exaggerating the deaths to score a political point. People have died due to heart attack, cancer and various other reasons and not in demonetization-related incidents.

The overwhelmingly charged up Congressmen, in the presence of UPCC president Raj Babbar and Congress leader Pramod Tiwari tried to sneak inside into the RBI campus but they could not do so. They gheraoed the RBI office and shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They also demanded resignation of RBI governor Urjit Patel.    Babbar first went to Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital to meet the injured passengers of Indore-Rajendra Nagar (Patna) Express derailment, who are undergoing treatment there. He wished them quick recovery.    He then reached Tilak Hall (Congress office) at Meston Road and met the Congress leaders and workers.    After a brief halt, Babbar led a procession to RBI office where heavy police force had already been deployed. On the way from Tilak Hall at Meston Road to Bada Chauraha and Mall road outside RBI office, Congress workers kept on raising slogans against Modi and his government, condemning him that his decision has brought miseries to the people. All sections of the society are facing hardships, they said.    The police prevented anyone from entering into the bank. Barricades had been set up. When Congress workers tried crossing over the barricades, they had heated arguments with the police. The cops pushed them back and formed a chain to see that nobody crosses over. Policemen had a tough time, lady constables who had to tussle with the women Congress workers trying to get inside the RBI campus. The securitymen at RBI also remained on toes and closed the gates. The traffic on the road outside RBI came to a halt due to the presence of a large crowd.    The people from nearby localities came in and joined the protest. They climbed over the road divider. There was choas all over. The agitation continued for an hour. The Congress activists stated that demonetisation has been poorly implemented as a result of which common people are suffering.    The Congress workers held placards and banners on which slogans against PM Narendra Modi were written. 'Janta Trast Hai, PM Hasne Rone Mein Mast Hain', '70 Mauton Ka Zimmedar Kaun Hai, Jawab Do', 'Janta Ko Karke Pareshan Modi Bhag Gaya Japan'.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/People-join-Congmen-to-protest-against-demonetisation/articleshow/55628573.cms,lucknow
2016-11-26 02:34:00,"Caught by surprise, netas criticising demonetisation move: PM Modi","NEW DELHI: An aggressive PM Narendra Modi escalated hostilities with the opposition on Friday and said the real angst of those accusing the government of not preparing adequately for the impact of demonetisation was that no one was given the time to prepare for the radical measure.    Speaking at a function here, the PM said, ""The criticism is that the government did not prepare fully. But this is not the issue. The pain of such people is that the government did not give anyone the time to prepare.""    Modi followed the barb by sarcastically noting that if he had given even 72 hours lead time that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were being scrapped, he would have been hailed. ""It would have been said there is no one like Modi,"" he said.    The PM's remarks prior to his departure for a function in Punjab were enough to provoke an agitated opposition which demanded an apology and protested in both Houses of Parliament where they called for Modi's presence.    Congress later alleged BJP members in Bihar had done land deals worth Rs 3.4 crore and claimed that this was a means of adjusting black money. They also pointed to alleged cash seizures from BJP leaders in other states.    BJP dismissed Congress's allegations saying the purchase in Bihar was for a district party office and payments were made in an above board manner and were accountable. Further, the party said income of political parties did not attract tax and it really did not matter where they deposited money before or after the November 8 demonetisation.    Modi's comments were also read as a response to former PM Manmohan Singh describing demonetisation as ""a case of organised loot and legalised plunder"" and that it reflected a ""monumental management failure"". The PM identified demonetisation with the interests of the common man, saying the ordinary citizen was the ""soldier"" in the country's battle against corruption and black money, noting India's poor standing in global corruption surveys.    Pushing for digital transactions, Modi said, ""Everyone has a right to use his or her money and no one stops them. It is not necessary you should have cash as one can spend using digital technology also.""    Modi's hard dig at the opposition, suggesting that BJP's political opponents were discomfited by the tough measures against black money, clearly indicates that he is ready to go head to head with rivals over the decision.    The PM's stance seems to draw on BJP's assessment that the decision has strong popular backing and the crisis caused by the sudden evacuation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes is abating. The lack of a popular outbreak against the decision despite long queues and disruption of daily cash flows has encouraged the BJP leadership.    But the PM's remarks were sufficient to keep the demonetisation pot bubbling as the opposition gears up for its nationwide protest on November 28. The parties are mostly focussing on hardships caused due to demonetisation. Congress has claimed that BJP was tipped off about the impending decision and had managed its cash.    Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee and AAP chief Arvind Kejirwal have called for a rollback of the decision.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Caught-by-surprise-netas-criticising-demonetisation-move-PM-Modi/articleshow/55629006.cms,

""How can Prime Minister level such an allegation... Prime Minister must apologise,"" Azad said as Congress and other opposition members trooped into the Well of the House. The scene was no different in the Lok Sabha where also the opposition protested over the PM's remark and demanded apology.    Amid the din, leader of Congress Mallikarjuna Kharge said, ""The issue now is not our demand for an adjournment motion but the remarks of the Prime Minister... He said the opposition supports black money."" TMC leader Sudip Bandhopadhyay made the same charge, demanding that the PM apologise.    ""There was good debate yesterday (Thursday) when everyone opposed black money.

2016-11-26 04:00:00,Auto industry cuts production as demonetisation hurts sales,"New Delhi: A decline in sales is prompting automobile companies to slash production as demonetisation has adversely impacted buyer sentiment and hit footfalls at showrooms.    Few companies were willing to talk on record over the matter, but officials said in private that ""things are getting increasingly difficult"" after the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that came into effect from November 8.    Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), the second-biggest two-wheeler manufacturer after Hero MotoCorp, said production is being ""rationalised"" to control inventories. The ""correction"" is being made both in factory production and dealer inventories, said Y S Guleria, senior VP (sales & marketing). ""We are not loading the dealer with excessive inventory,"" Guleria told TOI, adding that the company is working towards having ""no-production days"" to strike a balance with the slowdown.    Honda Cars India is also considering to align production to factor in slower offtake in the market, sources said. Jnaneswar Sen, senior VP for sales & marketing, has said bookings have come down by nearly 40% this month as the currency crunch is prompting people to withhold new purchases.    Officials at top manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai did not confirm a slowdown in output, though retailers for these brands have spoken about a ""massive squeeze"" in demand. Rakesh Srivastava, senior VP (sales & marketing) at Hyundai India has, however, said there are ""serious short-term challenges"" due to lower footfalls and conversions at showrooms. Pawan Munjal, chairman of Hero MotoCorp, had also complained of a ""steep drop"" in footfalls at showrooms in the first two days of demonetisation, though adding that things are gradually returning back to normal.    Industry sources said companies and dealers are ""not willing to take a chance"" towards the end of the year and thus retail outlets are not being loaded with heavy inventories. ""With the new year set to begin in about a month, dealers are not willing to be saddled with inventory of 2016. Companies are paying heed to their demand and adjusting output and stock levels.""    Component suppliers have already been briefed about the situation and many of them have started adjusting production schedules. ""The supply crunch is severe, and at least this quarter will be hit badly. Things should look up from the new year as the cash flow gets normal.""    Some of the auto retailers and the allied industry are also facing problems in meeting working capital requirements. ""The after-sales market for components is down by 60-70% in northern India. The situation is not healthy,"" a top industry executive said.    Durables, mobile inventory piles up    New Delhi: The cash crunch has impacted the consumer durables and the mobile phone market as inventory levels are piling up with retailers.    Inventory for products such as refrigerators, washing machines, air-conditioners and microwave ovens has hit around eight weeks against the normal level of two-to-three weeks, top industry sources said.    The mobile phone market is also feeling the pinch with expected sales down by 30% this month. ""The crunch has also impacted the cash-on-delivery segment, which is a critical component of online sales,"" a top official with a leading mobile phone company, said.    ""The overall situation in the industry is quite bad. We expect December to be another slow month,"" a top industry official said.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Auto-industry-cuts-production-as-demonetisation-hurts-sales/articleshow/55628450.cms,

""Every person has a right to spend his or her money. No one can take anyone's money. Now people can spend through mobile technology also,"" PM Modi said at a book release function in Parliament House Annexe on the occasion of Constitution Day.    ""The world is changing. We must move towards cashless economy,"" PM Modi said.

2016-11-26 04:38:00,"Demonetisation: Good politics, but bad economics, says Yogendra Yadav","GURGAON:  Yogendra Yadav    of Swaraj India, a party he floated along with senior advocate Prashant Bushant after parting ways with Arvind Kejriwal's AAP, says the Narendra Modi government's demonetization policy may be well-meaning but Prime Minister Modi has got his economics horribly wrong. Excerpts from an interview to    TOI    :      What will be the consequences of the demonetisation of 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee notes?      It's a good gesture which signals the government's seriousness about tackling black money. As of now, we don't know what the final consequences of this move will be. I can see two positives and many negatives. First, it puts an end to the fake currency problem and, second, it nudges the economy towards the recorded transactions rather than illicit ones that used to take place in cash. The question is whether the policy makers really factored in the rural and agrarian economy of this country while framing this policy. This policy confuses cash with black money. Not all cash is black and not all black money is cash.    I have not heard a single economist say that it is a sensible economic policy. It has been poorly executed. Clearly the government was not prepared for this transition. It had not anticipated the kind of havoc it would wreak on our economy.      It was sad that people died of shock and in the queues?      Yes, about 56 people have died so far as a result of the trauma triggered by this policy. When you do something on such a large scale, you have to plan for all possible consequences. The government does not seem to have anticipated them or planned the policy execution. Mr Modi might have got his politics right but has got his economics horribly wrong.      What was the ideal stand for the opposition on this issue?      Bharat bandh to protest against demonetisation is a not a wise political move. Opposition to the policy per se may not go down well with the people. I agree that it is a bad economic policy, yet the man in the street thinks it will eventually benefit him.      But the common man's support could be ascribed to his ignorance, right?      Yes, but that's what politics is all about. You deal with people as they think. You don't invent them. So the right way to oppose the policy would be to ask what else needs to be done to curb the black economy instead of focusing on the inconvenience caused by this policy.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/Good-politics-but-bad-economics-says-Yadav/articleshow/55628574.cms,gurgaon

According to mayor Sovan Chatteree, the department of economic affairs under the Union finance ministry wants the KMC to go ahead with the pro ect with its own funds that will be reimbursed from the ADB loan account.    The direction has come on y this week, days within the KMC -the borrower -signed the loan agreement with the ADB on November 21. It's a coincidence that the development follows West Bengal chief minister Mamata's going on warpath against the Centre over demonetisation.    ""We have been working on infrastructure projects with ADB loans since 2000. It has ne ver happened before. The ADB had always made direct transfers to our loan account soon after we fulfilled the criterion and procedure the bank wanted from us. If we had the resources to make payment to contractors on our own there was no need for loans. I thus fail to understand the Centre's guideline. I wonder if they have the authority to send us such guidelines when the ADB hasn't asked for it,"" the mayor said.Elaborating on the loan agreement, the mayor said: "" According to the loan agreement, the ADB will disburse the fund to our loan account and we will make payments to contractors.The ADB will supervise the entire project, both execution and expenditure,"" Chatterjee said.    Civic bosses were taken aback with the Centre's guideline because the KMC is the borrower and the loan agreement is between the borrower and the bank. The Centre has signed a guarantee agreement endorsing the loan application by KMC. ""The ADB handbook on loan disbursement clearly charts out the process of loan disbursement making provision for several modes of payment -direct payment to the loan account, reimbursement of funds made earlier for the project following the ADB guideline, and imprest fund. Nowhere in the ADB document there is a mention of the guarantor having a role in deciding the mode of payment,"" a KMC official said.

""Modi's move is very bold. We cannot imagine what would happen in China if the country bans its 50 and 100 yuan notes,"" said an editorial in the state-run Global Times titled 'Modi takes a gamble with money reform'. 100 yuan is China's highest currency note.    ""To prevent a leak of information jeopardising the implementation of the demonetisation reform, the roll out of the  plan had to be kept confidential+  . Modi is in a dilemma as the reform aims to render the black money useless but the process goes against the governance principle of winning support of the public before initiating a new policy,"" the editorial said.    ""As more than 90 per cent of transactions in India are made with cash, banning 85 per cent of the currency in circulation brings a lot of trouble to people's daily life"" sparking fierce criticism including from ""former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who termed it as organised loot"", it said.    ""  Demonetisation can crackdown on corruption and shadow economy+  but it is obviously unable to solve the deeper social and political issues that help breed the aforementioned problems,"" the editorial said.    However, it stated that as far as the root causes of corruption exist, the problems will always resurface.    ""In other words, the Modi government wishes to turn a long and arduous reform into a one-off deal,"" it said.    ""Demonetisation is a gamble for Modi. He bet on both the execution ability of the government and the tolerance level of the Indian society, hoping that the benefits of this reform can outrun the negative social impacts and low morale,"" the editorial said.    It asserted that the ""Western-style"" democratic system of India allows little room for such bold moves.    ""However, he is really carrying it out, and will create a precedent no matter he succeeds or fails,"" it said.    ""Reform is always difficult and requires more than just courage.

2016-11-25 23:56:00,Marathi film industry reels under demonetisation,"done...    Kolhapur: The Marathi film industry, which produced its biggest blockbuster, 'Sairat', earlier this year, is struggling to keep up the pace, as the demonetisation has badly affected the films released this month.    Meghraj Rajebhosale, president of the Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal (ABMCM), the apex body of the Marathi film industry, told TOI that due to demonetisation, the ongoing productions have almost stopped their operations.    ""The halt will hamper the backstage artists and technicians the most. The ABMCM has around 30,000 members, including directors, producers, actors, backstage artists and technicians. The demonetisation will have a major impact on the many lives associated with the film industry,"" he said.    The number of productions is likely to fall drastically in the next few months, which will eventually result in the number of Marathi films releasing next year, Rajebhosale said.    Every year, the Marathi film industry witnesses around 100 to 125 films getting released. However, the scenario might be different next year, he said.    Rajebhosale hopes that the genuine productions with substance will anyway find a way to keep their schedule.    The movie, 'Ventilator', directed by Rajesh Mapuskar, was released on November 4 . Even after demonetisation, it is going strong; but the commercial result is not the same as the filmmakers had expected.    Mapuskar said, ""Demonetisation has certainly hit all of us very hard and the box office collections are not the same as we had expected. Audience in metro cities and urban areas have given us overwhelming response but, collection in tier-2 and tier 3 cities is not as impressive as it could have been.""    He said the film has earned around Rs 11 crore across the state and that he is thankful to the audience for such response even in the hard times.    Sachin Kundalkar, director of the film 'Vazandar' which was released on November 11, said the business was hit hard in the semi-urban to rural areas, while it was satisfying in metro cities.    The post-Diwali period is generally favourable for films. However, due to the demonetisation, it has not been possible. It will take time to settle things for the industry, he said.    When asked whether they had considered delaying the release of 'Vazandar', after hearing about the demonetisation, Kundalkar said that it is a chain of events when it comes to releasing a movie and it cannot be broken just like that; so, there was no question of pulling out.    He added that in the cinema business these kinds of issues are part of the game.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/Marathi-film-industry-reels-under-demonetisation/articleshow/55627576.cms,kolhapur

""The Prime Minister has punished all who have amassed huge wealth, whether they are from his party (BJP) or others,"" he said, adding now they (black money hoarders) are getting ""sleepless nights"".    Singh claimed the move has reduced the gap between rich and the poor and now people would pay taxes instead of evading it.    ""I am not a BJP spokesperson but a SP Rajya Sabha member, whatever the opinion of my party might be on this issue but I have shared my personal view on it,"" he said.    However, he registered his protest against the mismanagement in implementing the demonetisation move, saying he was pained to the see the common people suffering due to it.    ""I am not against this scheme, but the government's failure in making proper arrangement before implementing the scheme has only brought sufferings in the lives of common people which has pained everyone of us,"" Singh said.    ""What is the purpose of implementing a scheme due to which poor, farmers, small traders and common people have to suffer?"" he said.    Singh claimed that due to demonetisation many companies have started reducing their staffs to cut their cost.    Raising questions over the app-based survey by the Modi government over the demonetisation, in which allegedly majority people have supported the move, the Rajya Sabha member said there were ""doubts"" on the survey.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-courageous-experiment-proud-to-have-such-PM-Amar-Singh/articleshow/55633277.cms,

Tata, who is locked in a bitter boardroom battle over control of the Tata Group with his successor Cyrus P Mistry, said the government's bold implementation of the demonetisation programme needs the nation's support.    ""Demonetisation is amongst the three most important economic reforms in India's history, along with delicensing and GST,"" Tata said in a tweet.    The Prime Minister's recent focus on mobile and digital payments will also greatly facilitate the transition from a cash-driven economy to a cashless economy, which in the ling term will enormously benefit the poor and underprivileged, he added.    ""The government's firm resolve to fight and eliminate black money needs the support and cooperation of all like minded citizens of India who would like to see more equitable distribution of the nation's resources in a new India of tomorrow, based on merit and equal opportunity,"" Tata said.    He added that the parallel black money economy in India has fueled tax evasion, money laundering and corruption.    ""The Prime Minister has displayed enormous courage in waging war on the black market economy in the country through the implementation of a major demonetisation programme,"" Tata said.    Earlier this week, the noted industrialist had asked the the government to consider special relief measures, similar to those employed at the time of national calamities, for the poor so as to lessen their hardships of currency crunch following demonetisation of high value notes.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-among-3-most-important-economic-reforms-Tata/articleshow/55635256.cms,

Suddenly there is an unusual silence and there is no report of any kind of kidnapping and extortion and this is all because of the demonetisation effect which has become a boon for small time traders, businessmen and even farmers, they said.    ""It gave them no way to push the money back into the banking system given that deposits are being fully monitored by all teams, including Income Tax, police and the like.    Militancy has been depressed by the sudden announcement of the prime minister,"" said South Garo Hills (SGH) police chief, Anand Mishra.    South and East Garo Hills are both known as militancy hotbeds with the dense forest cover of Durama Hills providing natural shelter for them.    The Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) and ASAK groups are the most active in the region and have been at the heart of all militant activities in the region, though splinter groups have also done their bit.    It is widely suspected that more than 500 crores lies in the hands of militant groups, mostly with the GNLA    ""This is a body blow for them as they have to bring out the money they stashed meaning a fear of exposure. We are also keeping a very close tab on amounts being deposited and have identified dozens of sympathisers and over ground workers of the group.

Suhail Yusuf, president of Brigade Road Establishment s Association, said that weekend business had dropped by 70% since November 8. ""Average weekend transaction on Brigade Road is approximately Rs 10 crore, largely because of the big brands on the road. But, they have also been impacted by demonetization,"" he said.    There has been a perceptible decrease in the number of people on Brigade Road in the wake of the Centre's move, observed a few shop owners on the street. Some of the owners have been in business on the road for over 50 years, while a few set up shop as recently as four years ago. However, all of them appear to be grappling with the same predicament. On average, the stores have seen business go down by 35% in the past two weeks.    Manager of the Louis Phillipe outlet on Brigade Road, Shangrei said, ""Sales at the store have dropped from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 20 lakh since demonetisation.""    Although Waffle Stories and Victory Dry Cleaners managed to recover from the sudden withdrawal of the two high currency notes, business continues to b lean at Geetha Export Garments. Owners without any facility to accept payment by card have suffered a double blow, since payment by credit and debit cards have witnessed a spike since November 8.    Hawkers plying their wares on the street side contend that the larger stores have remained largely unaffected. For the past 40 years, KA Raju has been selling books off a trolley. However, his business has been suffered badly in the past two weeks. ""I haven't had great sales in the past two weeks,"" he said.

2016-11-26 16:50:00,Demonetisation deals a blow to FICN: BSF,"SHILLONG: Demonetisation has dealt a blow to fake Indian currency notes (FICN) racketeers in Meghalaya who operate along the porous international border with Bangladesh, a BSF official has said.    Since the demonetisation move earlier this month, there has been no report of seizure of fake Indian currency notes by BSF in the state, which shares a 443 km-long border with Bangladesh, a senior BSF officer told PTI.    The force had seized Rs 63,500 fake currency this year but none since the demonetisation due to the high vigil maintained at the vulnerable spots at the border and the major economic decisions made by the Centre, he said.    Intelligence inputs gathered indicated that demonetisation has rendered helpless the FICN racketeers who had big plans to push these notes into the markets and destabilise the nation, the officer said.    BSF is maintaining high vigil in areas identified as vulnerable to racketeers taking advantage of the government's relaxation to transact using old Rs 500 notes, he said.    The border has some of the most treacherous terrain pockets which rendered it porous and hence accessible to FICN racketeers who include militants and cross border criminal gangs.    He said during the last five years BSF have seized FICN of face value of about Rs 10 lakh from the porous stretches in Meghalaya and the racketeers apprehended included 14 Indian and 37 Bangladesh nationals.    BSF has identified the bordering districts of South Garo Hills, South West Khasi Hills, East Khasi Hills, West and East Jaintia Hills districts as vulnerable.    Last year, there was least detection and apprehension of fake notes and the BSF seized only Rs 12,500 in South Garo Hills district.    The highest seizure made in the last five years was in 2012 and 2013 when the BSF seized Rs 5,55,000 and Rs 2,51,000 fake notes and arrested 31 Bangladesh nationals and 12 Indian racketeers, the official said.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-deals-a-blow-to-FICN-BSF/articleshow/55636564.cms,

Addressing Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Vijay Sankalp rally in Aldona, Parrikar said that following the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 bank notes, murder rates have come down by half in Mumbai. ""One of my friends from Mumbai told me that supari killing (contract killing) has dwindled now as there is no money to make payment for the supari,"" Parrikar said, adding, ""Over the past 20 days, the murder rate has halved in Mumbai"".    Parrikar said that movement of drugs has collapsed in Mumbai and the crime graph in the metropolitan city is decreasing because of the demonetization effect.    ""Khandani (extortion) which the builder used to give has stopped, as there is no value for the notes,"" Parrikar said.    Addressing the impressive gathering, which BJP claimed will decide the election in favour of the saffron party, Parrikar said that demonetization has been wiping out the drug menace, terror funding, fake notes and black money.    ""After demonetization, people have realized that the economic backbone of India is strong,"" Parrikar said. ""There is peace at the borders as we have no tolerance for peace violation,"" he said.    ""If they fire one at us, we will fire two at them. We would not like to have a war, but if someone looks at us in the wrong manner, we will not hesitate to hit their eyes,"" Parrikar said.

2016-11-27 05:47:00,Businesses in Camp fall silent post-demonetisation,"PUNE: Sheikh Imran mans a small apparel shop around MG Road's shopping area. Like his retired father did, he sells t-shirts, illustrated with recent trends and memes. But for the past two weeks, his routine has been to idle around at his shop for a while and make the rounds of the bank where he holds an account.    ""I stay in the shop until the time I have to go to the bank for exchanges or deposits. I sometimes have to shut my shop and go. Lekin kuchh farak nahi padta hai (But it doesn't make much of a difference). There are no sales. So I might as well shut shop and go,"" Imran said in a resigned tone.    Two weeks after demonetisation, Imran and his fellow businessmen in Camp have seen their sales fall off a cliff. For a business area whose sustenance is hard cash, the sudden almost-elimination of currency from people's wallets has hit sales and traders hard, especially the ones who sell perishables like bakeries and other eatables.    ""We sell bread and biscuits and other bakery items because of which we deal with large amounts of cash every day. But for the past two weeks, sales have dropped largely. We have to make less and less products with every passing day, because no one has any money to buy anything from us,"" Arun Mane, who works at an old bakery near Shivaji Market, said.    The ripple effect can be seen everywhere on the street. Parking space, coveted in the area, is shockingly easy to find, with the parking attendants mostly idling away.    ""Parking of cars and bikes has reduced over the past few days. Generally, they belong to people not living here and to shoppers, but they haven't been coming for a few days,"" a Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) parking attendant said.    The use and acceptance of credit and debit cards in the area is markedly low, expected in an area where businesses have dealt in cash, often for a century, and suddenly find themselves adrift.    ""I would say only 10 to 15% of the businesses out here use cards and e-wallets, the rest deal in cash. Many have done business only in cash for many decades, and they have to adapt to new technologies. It is obviously difficult for them,"" Anand Kochhar, chairman of the Pune Camp Merchants' Association, said.    He added that while demonetisation is ""good"", it could have been planned in a better way, such as dispensing a higher number of smaller denomination notes.    ""Sales are down more than 60-70%. People do not have cash to buy anything, and even if they do, all they have is Rs 2,000 notes. Where will our businessmen get change when most purchases do not exceed about Rs 500-600? The RBI should have introduced the Rs 500 notes first. I haven't seen a single one till now. Unless that is introduced, our businesses will continue to suffer,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Businesses-in-Camp-fall-silent-post-demonetisation/articleshow/55642944.cms,pune
2016-11-27 09:10:00,Council polls could be a vote on demonetisation,"NAGPUR: The elections on Sunday for 147 municipal councils and 18 panchayats across the state could well reflect what the voters think about Narendra Modi government's demonetisation move. Of the local bodies going to polls on Sunday, 61 are in Vidarbha.    In their hectic campaign in Yavatmal, Akola, Washim, Amravati, Buldhana and Wardha districts this week, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis as well as state Congress president Ashok Chavan focused on the same issue.    Terming it as a historical move in the interest of the country, Fadnavis tried to convince voters that Modi's decision to outlaw denomination notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 would root out Naxalism, terrorism and corruption.    Contradicting Fadnavis, Chavan highlighted the inconvenience caused to common people, the long queues in the banks and the dip in business activities in the last two weeks.    The local-body elections will be held in four phases with voting scheduled on November 27, December 14, 18 and January 8.    For the first time in these elections, voters of 192 of 212 municipal councils will directly elect the chairman of their council. This has led to increase in the involvement of top political leaders as compared to earlier local-body polls. With direct elections, larger parties have contested candidates and hope to have control on them. Till last elections, smaller parties, smaller parties, with local flavour, had bigger role in such elections and in the end unusual combinations were struck for power.    Besides this, a panel system too has been adopted. There will be two panels of two wards each for the municipal councils. A cabinet committee headed by Fadnavis invited suggestions and objections from local representatives and accordingly recommended the changes. Then, municipal law was amended for direct election of council chairman.    A senior state government official said the decision was mostly politically motivated, mainly to overcome caste or gender-based reservation of wards and ensure local political leaders didn't lose their voters due to their wards being reserved for a particular category.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Council-polls-could-be-a-vote-on-demonetisation/articleshow/55640643.cms,nagpur

Retailers spotted green shoots of recovery in leisure spending on Saturday when people thronged malls, eateries and queued up to grab a show of 'Dear Zindagi'.    Demonetisation had pushed leisure spending to the back burner with people spending most of the times outside the banks and ATMs struggling to withdraw money to meet their expenses.    But retailers spotted some recovery on the first 'free' Saturday since the demonetisation demon choked spends in nearly every household and forced people to spend long hours in queues to withdraw their money from banks. Kolkata broke the fetters and were out in strong numbers to shop and enjoy normal life, albeit for a day.    In the traditional shopping zones of New Market in central Kolkata, Gariahat in south and Hatibagan in north, a sea of shoppers descended on Saturday afternoon. Homemaker Kaberi Roy, who was out to shop with her daughter Sarmistha Saha and grandson Sumannu, couldn't contain her delight.    ""It feels great to be out after staying put at home fearing unnecessary spends. Since spends have been extremely conservative, it has led to forced saving. The mood has also been rather grim. So I decided to call my daughter over for retail therapy. Just arriving at New Market and seeing the crowd of shoppers has lifted the spirit,"" said Roy.    Also out to shop was bank employee S Biswas and his wife. After sustaining incredible pressure at the bank, it was the first Saturday off in November and he intended to make the most of it. ""I didn't want to waste the day staying indoors. All these days, I have been shuttling between home and office. No one's sure what happens next with month beginning to reckon with. So I decided to make the most of Saturday,"" he remarked.    S S Hogg Market Traders' Association president Ashok Gupta said several reasons led to the high turnout after the market being deserted for over a fortnight. ""This is marriage season and people have to buy gifts. Also, winter is round the corner and warm clothes have to be bought. And how long will you postpone everything? I think people needed a release and they have come out to shop and have a good time,"" he said.    The Left Front parties have called a general strike on Monday. Though the government has assured that it will keep the city on the move, people did not seem they wanted to take any chances.    Many wanted to make the most of the good times till they lasted.

When asked about the Uttar Pradesh election and  talks of rift in the Grand Alliance partners in Bihar+  and whether JD(U) was to join hands with BJP again, Singh said neither there was a rift nor was any plan of going with the saffron party.

2016-11-28 13:19:00,Demonetisation hits Lhasa Market business,"Patna: The Tibetan refugees, who make a living by selling winter clothes at the Lhasa Market here from mid October to January end every year, are facing a tough time because of poor cash flow in the market due to the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. While some have lost hopes, others expect good business once the mercury dips further.  ""We are also bearing the brunt of demonetisation. There has been over 50% drop in sales post-demonetisation. It's a double whammy for us as we are yet to recover from the poor business in the last two years due to comparatively warm winter. I have stock of jackets, blankets and woollens gathering dust. The season seems to be a washout this year, too. However, I hope the situation will improve when mercury drops further,"" said Rigzin Topgyal, who was manning one of the shops at the Lhasa Market.  When asked why are they not opting for cashless transactions, he said, ""This market is for a short period of about three months and it's not practically possible to manage card payments at a short notice. Moreover, we work a cash-and-carry business. It is difficult for small traders like us, who move from one place to another, to have card swipe machines for cashless transactions.""  Not only Topgyal, but almost all the shopkeepers in the market, have little knowledge of card based transactions. They prefer cash business and avoid using technology.  Dolma, who was manning another shop, said people usually buy clothes for coming years to avoid price escalation, but no one is doing so this time. ""Some people are coming with currency of Rs2000 denomination, making it difficult for us to provide change. I don't know what will happen,"" said Wandu, another shopkeeper in the market.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Demonetisation-hits-Lhasa-Market-business/articleshow/55654648.cms,patna
2017-01-29 07:21:00,Javed Akhtar clarifies statement on demonetisation affecting 'Rock On 2' collections,"Bollywood lyricist and former Rajya Sabha MP Javed Akhtar today said it would be 'stupid' for him to say that 'Rock On 2's box office performance was affected due to demonetisation. ""If I say demonetisation has affected one particular film (Rock 2) that will be a stupid statement,"" he told reporters here. ""Obviously for a while, this move shrunk the spending capacity of the people, which was reflected on everything. I am not talking about one film trivializing a national issue,"" he said.    Akhtar said society was left with 16 per cent of the currency after government scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which formed 84 per cent of notes, from November 8. ""However, it is obviously filling the gap very fast and quickly things are coming back to normalcy,"" he said.  Javed Akhtar: Standard of Bollywood music has droppedRevered lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar on Friday said the standards of modern day Bollywood music have dropped and that is a reflection of contemporary society.

Replying to a query, Akhtar said he was a big fan of singer Kishore Kumar because he had tremendous appeal which no other singer had.    Javed Akhtar said, ""I am a great fan of Kishore Kumar.By saying I am not undermining other singers because Rafi sahab, Mukeshji, Talat Mehmood, Manna Dey - all of these singers have rendered immortal songs.I feel the kind of appeal Kishore Kumar had, nobody had.""    In the women's category, he said ""there is no one like Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle is known for her versatility."" Among music directors, Akhtar said he rated the late RD Burman highly and of the present lot, Shankar Mahadevan.    Talking about Javed Akhtar, Shankar Mahadevan said, ""He has been a friend, philosopher and mentor. From day one when I came into the film industry I have been working with him (Akhtar).We have been working together since 20 plus years.""

Chidambaram's comments had come at the  Times LitFest 2016 in New Delhi+  , where he was part of a panel discussion on the topic 'Debating Modi Sarkar: The Role of the Opposition'. The other panellist was former Indian Foreign Serice officer and JDU MP Pavan Varma. The discussion was moderated by senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai.    ""This is not note bandhi (shut down), this is note badli (change),"" quipped the former Union Finance Minister. ""If you take away the livelihood of 45 crore people, is it not wrong? If your decision (demonetisation) is forcing people to beg and borrow, it is an unethical decision,"" Chidambaram said.    Chidambaram brushed off a question from the moderator on whether there is a trust deficit between the government and the Opposition. ""I think you are making it up. There are sharp differences, but they don't shun each other,"" he said.    However, his co-panellist, JDU's Pavan Varma, expressed reservation with the disruption of Parliament proceedings over the demonetisation issue. ""Opposition's strategy was confused. When the Prime Minister wanted to speak, Opposition should have let him. Instead, they disrupted the session,"" he said.    ""There is not a single day on which Parliament is not adjourned. Parliament must function for Opposition to put its point across,"" he added.    Varma however decried the narrowing of space for the airing of political differences. ""Even though we congratulate the government on the surgical strikes, if we ask any questions we are called anti-national.

Since last two to three days, people have gone on overdrive on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp opposing and supporting Bharat bandh against demonetisation supposedly called by all opposition parties on Monday. However, the fact is no such call has been given.    Congress has, in fact, charged BJP with spreading the rumour that it had called a Bharat bandh over demonetisation on Monday. It has clarified that it would observe the day as Jan Akrosh Diwas to highlight the problems being faced by common man following discontinuation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.    Among the major political parties, only Congress is taking out a protest march. City Congress President Vikas Thakre said that the march would begin from Zero Mile at 11am and after moving through Sitabuldi Main Road, it would conclude at Variety Square. ""The common people are suffering a lot because of the government's decision. We want to highlight this and bring the government to its senses,"" he added.    NCP and MNS leaders said that they had no plans to protest the demonetisation decision on Monday. The inaction on part of NCP is strange because it has supported Trinamool Congress chief Mamta Bannerjee in her fight against the demonetisation decision.    BSP leader Gautam Patil not only slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking the demonetisation decision, he flayed the Congress for taking out a protest rally. ""BJP and Congress are the two sides of the same coin. Both want to keep the poor in poverty and facilitate the rich in becoming richer.

On Sunday, however, the BSP boss said the bandh was ""'just a gesture of opposition to show sympathy towards the people suffering because of the demonetisation"".    The BSP chief commented, ""Otherwise too, the country is already facing a bandh like situation ever since the Modi government announced demonetisation.""

On Sunday, BJP national president Amit Shah welcomed Kumar's support for demonetization, a move by the Centre recently to root out the menace of black money .    ""I welcome Nitish Kumar's support for PM Narendra Modi's fight against black money ,"" Shah said, addressing a huge gathering at the OBC morcha rally in Bengaluru.    Earlier on Sunday , Kumar, while urging the government to check the hardships faced by the masses across the country due to a cash crunch, declared he would not support the all-India protest called by opposition parties, since he felt the move will help fight black money .    However, he denied re ports alleging that Shah personally met Kumar at his residence, saying those with a perverted mindset were spreading such canards.

A day after Modi banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, common man was at the receiving end, particularly in rural parts of the state, as hotel owners, traders and businessmen refused to accept old currency notes.    Those travelling, were the worst affected, as they could not exchange their old notes. Alarmed by the plight of people, Raut put up a notice board on his hotel, saying, do not worry, eat whatever you like, if you do not have money, pay the bills later whenever you are passing gar from here. Raut's rare gesture nered pleasant response. Almost for a week, quite a large number of customers did not pay the bills that ranged between Rs 100 to Rs 1500 and in some case, it was more than Rs 2,000. A few customers suggested Raut to maintain a register. After a week, Raut found many customers, who had not paid, visited his hotel to settle the bills.    Raut says, most of the customers have paid their outstanding bills and he is least concerned about the defaulters, otherwise also he has been facing problem from wilful defaulters. In his brief speech, Modi observed that people like Raut reflect the power of the country, his sacrifice and honesty will go a long way in enlightening the people on ill-effects of black money.      Back with a bang!      Former chief minister and state Congress president Ashok Chavan has emerged more powerful than ever before after the crucial elections to the legislative council. The elections were crucial to both Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress, since it was for the first time that that the Congress and NCP were contesting the elections against each other. Ever since the elections were declared, efforts were made for a patch up between both the parties at the high command level too, but Chavan took a firm stand, saying, under no circumstances, Congress will join hands with NCP . NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Praful Patel had taken personal interest to ensure that maximum NCP nominees are elected. In fact, in Nanded, all parties, including Shiv Sena and NCP had supported retired bureaucrat Shyamsundar Shinde to ensure defeat of Congress nominee Amar Rajurkar, a trusted aide of Chavan.    The opposition strategy did not work as Rajurkar won the polls by a comfortable margin. In Sangli-Satara, the stronghold of NCP leader Jayant Patil, Congress nominee Mohan Kadam, brother of senior Congress leader Patangrao Kadam was elected.

Gadkari visited Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena president Raj Thackeray . Since Matoshree was his first stop, media had gathered outside Uddhav Thackeray's residence. Coincidently, on that day he (Uddhav) had come down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the manner in which the NDA government had declared the demonetisation plan.    Since Shiv Sena had been the electoral partner of the BJP for well over two and half decades, BJP never expected that Uddhav Thackeray will openly oppose PM's decision of currency ban. After a brief meeting with Thackeray, Gadkari came out to a volley of questions on his discussion with the Shiv Sena leader. Known for his sense of humour, Gadkari said no politics was discussed at all as he had come to invite Uddhav for the wedding of his daughter Ketki in Nagpur on December 6. Significantly, ever since BJP joined hands with Shiv Sena for the elections, Gadkari had played a crucial role in resolving the disputes between the two political parties.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Samaritan-fights-demons-of-demonetisation/articleshow/55657608.cms,mumbai
2016-11-28 07:05:00,My slim demonetised wedding,"Here is how families left in the lurch before the big day are coping with the note ban        As Mumbai-based finance executive Amit Angane tied the knot with bank officer Sonal Kanse (see picture) on 21 November, the relief among family members was palpable. Preparations for the wedding had been on for weeks, but the government's sudden move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes threw everything into disarray. The venue had been booked and caterers paid partly in advance, but there was little cash in hand to meet other expenses. The stingy limits set on cheque and ATM withdrawals did not help. Finally, more than a dozen friends and relatives of both families came to the rescue by queuing up at ATMs daily for a week to put together Rs 1.5 lakh in cash. This allowed for the other vendors to be paid, and the wedding to take place as planned.    So why has demonetisation hit the wedding industry so hard? Says Sachin Singhal, CEO and Co-founder of wedding portal Bandbaajaa.com, ""The wedding industry is a cash-driven one. At least 60-70% of payments have to be made in hard currency"". Vendors like florists, decorators and musicians are wary of taking remuneration in cheques and even more reluctant to deal with digital payments.    The whammy could not have come at a worse time. Since it is peak wedding season, a number of families had withdrawn large amounts of cash in notes that are now worthless.    For Ahmedabad-based Shyam Parekh's wedding to Reepal Parekh on 4 December, his parents had withdrawn Rs 5 lakh in cash in the first week of November. Now, they are running around trying to deposit the cash back in the bank and withdraw enough for the wedding at the same time. The Parekhs approached their bank to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh from their savings account, but were turned away as the branch was unsure about the guidelines. They intend to approach the bank again with a set of documents as mentioned in the RBI guidelines announced on 21 November. Till then, emergency funds kept at home in Rs 100 notes and loans from friends are being used to cope.  The way around  So what can families do in a situation like this? According to Nikita Dogra, Cofounder of wedding planning firm Doli Saja Ke Rakhna, it might be a good idea to use one's home, if it's big enough, as the venue. This would take care of a huge cost. Concentrating on quality rather than quantity when it comes to the trousseau, limiting festivities to only one day instead of three, and being creative with decorations instead of opting for theme weddings are the cost-cutting ideas suggested by Sumathy Bachchan, owner of wedding planning firm Wedding Sutras.    Trimming down the guest list is another way of keeping costs low.School teacher Vandana Dhuriya and IT professional Vinod Kumar (see picture) got married in Uttar Pradesh's Ambedkar Nagar district on 23 November with only 100 odd guests in attendance, instead of the planned 350, and that too after relatives pitched in with `3 lakh in cash.    In Tier I and Tier II cities, one can go for cashless options while booking banquet halls. Abhishek Kadam, Director of Ritz Banquets in Mumbai, advises, ""Opt for in-house services offered by the venue owners. That way you have to deal with only one entity rather than multiple unorganised vendors who insist on being paid in cash.""    It may be more expensive, but the peace of mind is worth it.    Mumbai-based chartered accountant Saurabh Lakhwara (see picture) has asked his parents and sister to withdraw Rs 24,000 from each of their bank accounts every week till 9 December, the day he is tying the knot with Rashi Khetan. With the money collected so far, he has made advance payments for the venue and caterer and paid the decorator in full. As all four have their bank accounts in the same branch, one member is going every week with four cheques to stand in queue. For those who haven't yet booked the venue, Lakhwara recommends negotiating a tax inclusive package. ""Paying through cheque or RTGS for banquet halls and other services invites a 15% service tax liability. However, this also ensures a clean and recorded transaction,"" he says. As Singhal points out, ""The wedding industry will become more organised in the long run.We are seeing a huge shift from cash to digital mode of payments.""    Like the Lakhwaras, the Upadhyays of Junagadh are also busy withdrawing `24,000 a week for their daughter Sweta's wedding to Nisarg Dave (see picture) on 1 December. Though they have been planning for the past six months, shopping for clothes and jewellery is yet to be done. As most jewellers are unwilling to accept card payments, the family is hoping to be able to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh from the bank, in accordance with the new guidelines, in time for the wedding.    For those who do not want to scrimp on costs in the time of a cash crunch, choosing wedding planners who have tied up with banks is an option. For instance, Weddingz.in has tied up with Yes Bank to provide short-term loans for customers. Some wedding planners are also game for flexible payment options like EMIs. So, while the cash crisis may have thrown many a family into a tizzy, affected vendors are also changing the way they do business to stay in the game.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/My-slim-demonetised-wedding/articleshow/55657741.cms,
2016-11-28 08:05:00,"Post-demonetization, BJP faces first poll test","SURAT/RAJKOT: Two municipalities in south Gujarat and Gondal taluka panchayat went to elections on Sunday, the first electoral test for the Gujarat BJP after Prime Minister's announcement to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.    The municipalities of Vapi and Kanakpur-Kansad in Valsad district registered around 66% and 62% turnouts respectively while Gondal taluka panchayat saw around 55% turnout.    The elections were necessitated in the municipalities as their terms ended while Gondal civic body was dissolved last year after a tie between the Congress and BJP.    The results of the two local bodies on November 29 would help the BJP leadership gauge the mood of the people in Gujarat, which will see assembly elections next year, on the decision taken to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes.    Barring municipal corporations, BJP had witnessed severe electoral reverses in the civic body elections held last November, mainly due to the Patidar quota stir.    While demonetization did heavily play on voters' minds, Munga-Vavdi village under Gondal taluka panchayat boycotted the elections to protest the severe hardships being faced by farmers in wake of scrapping of the notes. BJP and Congress workers even came to blows in Harmatiya village. However, tension was defused immediately by the police.    Kanakpur-Kansad saw around 66.73 per cent votes being polled with 11,430 exercising their franchise of the total 17,129. Some ward even saw a massive 85 per cent turnout.    In Vapi, which has a significant population of urban electorate, around 62 per cent voting was recorded with around 52,000 people cashing their vote of the total around 85,000 for 42-member board.

The rally, organised by representatives of organisations working with Dalits, tribals and minorities, saw PM Narendra Modi and BJP being criticised with speakers claiming that 75 ""tribal districts"" were worst hit for they either lacked banks or had severely inadequate banking facilities. The rally saw the launch of a unified campaign against ""communal and divisive"" forces.

Strict action was demanded against ""so-called cow vigilante groups"" unleashing violence on Dalits and Muslims.    The founding chairman of National Confederation of Dalit Organisations (NACDOR) Ashok Bharti cited demonetisation as an example of how governments in the past and present had failed to connect with the concerns of the marginalised.    ""I want to ask the prime minister about the 75 tribal districts where there are either no banks or the state of banking is dismal. How will people over there cope with the situation?"" Bharti asked.

In Vadodara, Congress leaders and members of the party's women's wing had staged protests outside the house of minister of state for sports, youth and cultural affairs, Rajendra Trivedi on Sunday morning.

2016-11-28 08:14:00,Good Samaritan fights demons of demonetisation,"PUNE: In his Mann Ki Baat broadcast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi showered praise on Muralidhar Raut, who owns a small hotel in Balapur tehsil in drought prone Akola district in the Vidarbha region.    A day after Modi banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, common man was at the receiving end, particularly in rural parts of the state, as hotel owners, traders and businessmen refused to accept old currency notes.    Those travelling, were the worst affected, as they could not exchange their old notes. Alarmed by the plight of people, Raut put up a notice board on his hotel, saying, do not worry , eat whatever you like, if you do not have money , pay the bills later whenever you are passing from here. Raut's rare gesture garnered pleasant response. Almost for a week, quite a large number of customers did not pay the bills that ranged between Rs 100 to Rs 1,500 and in some case, it was more than Rs 2,000. A few customers suggested Raut to maintain a register.    After a week, Raut found many customers, who had not paid, visited his hotel to settle the bills. Raut says, most of the customers have paid their outstanding bills and he is least concerned about the defaulters, otherwise also he has been facing problem from wilful defaulters.    In his brief speech, Modi observed that people like Raut reflect the power of the country, his sacrifice and honesty will go a long way in enlightening the people on ill-effects of black money .

Former chief minister and state Congress presi and state Congress president Ashok Chavan has emerged more powerful than ever before after the crucial elections to the legislative council.

NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Praful Patel had taken personal interest to ensure that maximum NCP nominees are elected. In fact, in Nanded, all parties, including Shiv Sena and NCP had supported retired bureaucrat Shyamsundar Shinde to ensure defeat of Congress nominee Amar Rajurkar, a trusted aide of Chavan.

2016-11-28 08:24:00,Demonetisation: Blanket reprieve unlikely for currency deposits up to Rs 2.5 lakh,"NEW DELHI: There may not be a blanket reprieve for anyone depositing demonetised notes up to Rs 2.5 lakh under the scheme being worked out by the government for those holding unaccounted cash. The government is likely to introduce an amendment this week in Parliament that will allow those depositing unaccounted cash in demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes to pay 50% tax, lock in 25% amount for four years at zero interest, leaving only 25% for immediate use.    Under the scheme, all large deposits beyond a threshold could be asked to explain the source and why the 50% tax and the mandatory 25% deposit scheme should not be applied.    Tax officials may look at all significant deposits of demonetised notes to see if there is unaccounted wealth or smaller deposits in a household in different family members' accounts.    ""There is a Rs 2.5 lakh exemption but if you have split (the money) and four family members have each deposited this amount, then it will need to be seen,"" said a government official.    Changes to the income tax law were approved by Union Cabinet on Thursday. The government had earlier said it would not look into deposits of up to Rs 2.5 lakh, income tax exemption threshold.    ""We would be getting reports of all cash deposited during the period of November 10 to December 30 above a threshold of Rs 2.5 lakh in every account,"" Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia had said on November 10. ""The department would do matching of this with income returns filed by the depositors. And suitable action may follow.""    There are reports people with unaccounted cash in the old denominations have been farming it out to others to deposit in their accounts.      JAN DHAN ACCOUNTS AWASH      Balances in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana accounts swelled by more than Rs 27,000 crore between November 9 and 23, raising the suspicion that these accounts, meant to promote financial inclusion of the poor, were being used to launder money. There are also reports of informal channels being used to launder currency at a 30-35% discount. The disclosure option allows people to come clean at a 50% cost.    The government had on November 8 demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes but allowed limited use of these currencies till November 24 as also exchange and deposits.'    Exemptions have been extended till December 15 but only for Rs 500 notes. The Rs 1,000 currency note is not usable anywhere now, except for depositing in bank accounts.

2016-11-28 10:07:00,Demonetisation rocks granite industry,"ONGOLE: Demonetisation has served a lethal blow to the already struggling granite industry in Andhra Pradesh. Unable to deal with severe currency shortage, granite units in Prakasam district have decided to stop production from Monday throwing about 10,000 people out of employment.    The crisis has deepened as hundreds of labourers have been in search of work for the past two weeks at Chimakurthy in the Ongole revenue division. A week after demonetisation of high value currency on November 8, granite units have steadily scaled back production. Initially, the number of work shifts came down to two from the usual three. Last week, the factories worked in single shift and now the production has been halted indefinitely. With severe cash crunch, industrialists have decided to slow down production and wait for the situation to ease.    ""We are left with no choice but to stall operations because of small currency shortage. We could not pay wages to our workers. The situation is so severe that we could not even honour our export orders as transporters demand payment in cash,"" said AP State Granite Factories Owners' Association president Yerramneni Koteswara Rao. He said that if factories were not closed, they would have incurred losses.    The granite industry of Prakasam district has an annual turnover of Rs 2,000 crore. It provides employment to over 10,000 people. Chimakurthy , also known as granite town, alone employs around 8,000 workers in the industry, mostly from Tamil Nadu. Granite factories are also located at Martur, Ballikurava, Ongole and Santanutalapadu.    Granite factory owner D Srinivasa Rao said the industry has been reeling under the onslaught of taxes and imposition of royalties by the state government when the demonetisation bomb fell on them. ""The ban on high value currency and restrictions on cash withdrawal have dealt a lethal blow to the industry,"" Rao said.    Layoffs in the granite factories have directly affected several allied businesses. ""My business dipped to an all-time low. Worried about their future, people have cut down their spending,"" said local grocery shop owner M Sambasiva Rao. Rao, who has seen slumps in granite industry in the past as well, said the current crisis has caused heavy damage to the region's economy.    There are about 40 big and 50 small granite units in Chimakurthy, while other towns in the district have another 100 factories.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/Demonetisation-rocks-granite-industry/articleshow/55659689.cms,vijayawada

""It is impractical to rush to a mall or call for home delivery for daily needs like vegetables but with lack of cash, we have to use plastic money or net banking.

2016-11-28 11:43:00,Demonetisation: 5 things to learn about managing personal finances,"Though the exercise is unlikely to be repeated any time soon, demonetisation offers some takeaways that should form the cornerstone of your financial strategy.  1. Don't wait for a crunch to budget or spend wisely  The first takeaway from demonetisation is also the mainstay of every financial plan: save and spend according to a budget. During the current crisis, people have been forced to first take care of their critical expenses, investments and bills, before considering discretionary expenses, while entertainment and frivolous purchases have been completely done away with. The restricted inflow of cash means that saving has become a priority, as does sticking to a tight budget. While one need not curtail one's finances to such an extreme in the normal course, it is this forced discipline of budgeting and prioritising one's spending that will help you reach your financial goals with ease. So have a healthy dose of discretionary expenses, but not before you have saved and invested.  2. Don't hold too much cash; invest it  If you've been stashing money at home to fend off an emergency, rethink the strategy. Cash does offer flexibility and you should have 3-6 months' worth of expenses at hand. But even this amount should be invested in short-term debt funds, liquid funds or sweep-in savings accounts linked to fixed deposits. If, however, you have a copious amount lying idle, know that you are eroding its purchasing power. The money is not growing and inflation will allow you to buy fewer things with the same amount some years down the line. Besides, you are forgoing the high returns you could have earned by investing it in, say, equity, for long-term goals. Also try to make most transactions cashless and retain only a small amount of cash at home.  3. Don't change asset allocation in a panic  Panic is virtually a default reaction in times of financial crises or unexpected developments like demonetisation. Though Indian investors have wisened up since the 2008 economic crisis, many are still rushing to the security of gold and debt after the 8 November announcement. This is yet another opportunity to remember that asset allocation should be changed only in line with your age, short- and long-term needs, risk appetite and proximity to life's goals. While one should rebalance from time to time to retain the desired asset allocation, do not take erratic decisions and risk your investments by reacting to short-term aberrations.  4. Keep pace with tech to handle your finances  It pays to keep pace with technology. Literally, as demonetisation has proved. Though banks and other institutions have been pushing online and mobile transactions for a few years now, demonetisation may prove to be the inflection point. Even as people are rushing to download mobile wallets and register for Net banking and online transactions, the clear learning is that it is critical to keep track of the latest tech upgrades. The people who were already paying their bills via Net banking or mobile wallets, and using credit cards, did not suffer as much as those who weren't. It's high time then to shift to mobile banking, downloading apps for financial transactions, and learning about online transfer of funds. It will not only increase your ease of transactions, but also cut down on time and help save money.  5. Buy your kid a piggy bank, give pocket money  The final takeaway from demonetisation is to provide your child a piggy bank and a regular supply of pocket money. The children who already have these proved to be a boon for their parents during the current crisis, with lower currency and loose change helping tide over the difficult time. The learning, however, is not to rely on this stash as a contingency fund since these minuscule savings are unlikely to help you during a bigger financial crisis. On the other hand, the habits of regular saving, discrete spending, making their own purchases and focused saving for small goals will inculcate financial discipline in kids. They are not only likely to manage their finances better as adults but also handle crises with greater equanimity.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-5-things-to-learn-about-managing-personal-finances/articleshow/55661270.cms,

2016-11-28 13:03:00,Demonetisation blow: The last straw for farmers,"VIJAYAWADA: Contrary to the claims of the central government and BJP leaders that farmers will not be affected by demonetisation, the agriculture sector in Andhra Pradesh is actually in the doldrums with sowing for Rabi not being taken up in large tracts of land. With the Krishna-Godavari delta region being the rice bowl, any output reduction is likely to hit both AP and Telangana. The common capital Hyderabad too gets a bulk of its food grain and cereal supplies from East and West Godavari and Krishna district.    The failure of northeast monsoon coupled with steep fall in reservoir levels has already affected Rabi activities.The sudden demonetisation of high value currency is the proverbial last straw for farmers. Any further delay in Rabi sowing will affect the total productivity of food grains.    Though the farmers wanted to take up cultivation in the second week of November despite the dry spell, the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has left them fearful. While the percentage of area under cultivation increased by three per cent when compared to the previous week, it increased by only one per cent between November 9 and 24.    ""Since rural banks are not dispensing enough cash, we are using whatever little money we have for harvesting Kharif crop. With this, sowing operations during the Rabi season have dipped when compared to last year's activity during the same period,"" said P Sivaiah of Peda pulipaka in Krishna district.    However, sowing is of little use after the second week of December, since transplantation work for paddy will be in the final stage. This is said to have affected total food grain production in the state.    The drought across the state during Kharif is estimated to result in a sharp decline of food grain production. The 2015-16 food grain production stood at 13.96 million tonnes of which about 8.5 million tonnes was produced in the Kharif season and 5.4 million in the Rabi.    Thanks to the drought conditions in 13 districts between July and September, it is estimated that Kharif food production is set to fall by 30 per cent. If a similar situation prevails even in the current Rabi, the production will further decline.    Assuming that the situation would continue for two more weeks, agriculture experts say it will affect the total food grain production. ""There will be about three million tonnes decline in food grain production in the Khariff season due to drought. The dry spell coupled with cash crunch is also expected to ha ve its effect on the overall agricultural production scenario. Though it is too early to predict the outcome, about 20 per cent of produce, especially pulses, will be affected,"" said former member of Indian Council of Agricultural Research M V S Nagi Reddy .    Calculations based on above prediction show that there will be a likely slump of 1 - 1.2 lakh tonnes in food grain production in the Rabi season. Therefore, the food grain production is going to be just about 9-10 lakh tonnes this year. It may be recalled that the state targeted 17.9 million tonnes food grain production in 2016-17 as initial reports showed good monsoon this year.    As the food grains produced in 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh also meet the needs of Telangana and parts of Tamil Nadu, arrival of grains in Hyderabad and other cities is likely to be affected. ""Drought has played a major role in the decline. We need to wait and see if ramifications of demonetisation will reflect on the total food grain production,"" said a senior official from agriculture department.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/Demonetisation-blow-The-last-straw-for-farmers/articleshow/55662903.cms,vijayawada
2016-11-28 14:41:00,Demonetisation: Closure of over-the-counter cash exchanges hits people in villages badly,"CHENNAI: The November 24 closure of over-the-counter cash exchanges has sent shock waves to many bank managers, who were unprepared for the announcement. When he announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said old currencies could be exchanged at banks till December 30 and the limit would be enhanced after November 24. But the sudden closure of the exchange option caught banks and people in remote and rural locations unawares.For 19-year-old student hostel student S Durga from Thepperumanallur near Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, demonetisation hit when she had her term exams at her polytechnic engineering college. Choosing to focus on her studies, she thought she had enough time before December 30. But with this move, the teenager was scrambling to open a bank account using her family's ration card to exchange more than Rs 6,500 in cash - her term fees for the next semester. For 42-year-old P Dhanam, a farmhand in Vaniyambadi, her problem of cash exchange had been exacerbated by an abusive alcoholic husband. For nearly three years now, she had been secretly saving up Rs 43,000 in cash for her daughter's wedding. As a daily worker, she was unable to get all her cash exchanged and open a bank account. She was also worried as the bank staff at Vaniyambadi held her story suspect, implying that she could be a pawn in someone's game to convert black money to white.Dhanam said she was managing to survive with some Rs 1,000 she had got exchanged in new Rs 100 notes, which she feared would run out soon. Being cash-strapped, many banks in rural areas like Jolarpettai, Krishnagiri, Vanimayambadi, Sivagangai in Tamil Nadu and Bellary, Hoskute in Karnataka set their own internal limits for cash exchanges. ""Since the queues were long, we would dispense only Rs 1,000 even though the cash exchange limit was at Rs 4,000 earlier. We told people to come back later as we were out of cash,"" said an SBI branch manager in Sivagangai. Karur Vysya Bank CEO K Venkataraman told TOI earlier that they had to ration out cash, lower than the limit, because of the currency crunch.Many bank managers told the public to come back later in the good faith that they would be able to exchange their money any time before December 30. With the rules changed, bank managers are finding that they have to open bank accounts on a priority basis for the unbanked, so that they can have some access to cash.SBI said that it was using bank mitras on a war footing to ensure that people get help in opening bank accounts. Banks like KVB said they had opened 200-300 accounts in a day at factory locations so that workers are not affected. ""We have many small scale owners who have approached us now, who earlier paid their employees only in cash. We have been opening accounts en masse for their workers,"" said K Venkataraman, CEO, KVB. Tea estates are also now rushing to bank windows to ensure their workers don't suffer. ""It was unfortunate, but we were not able to pay our workers last Monday for the week. We are hoping to get bank accounts opened at least by this Monday, as we realise this has put them in a tight spot,"" said Dinesh Raju, owner of Darmona Teas, Kotagiri, Tamil Nadu. Banks are also distributing payroll cards for customers, but that has not taken off. ""Many ATMs are non-functional or even when they do operate they run out of cash in an hour. So migrant workers are not very keen on payroll cards given the per day limit of Rs 2,000 and the need to hunt a working ATM in a rural location,"" said Venkataraman.DCB Bank IT head R Venkattesh said their rural bank branches were focused on banking the unbanked. ""Even before this, banks were trying to open such accounts as the government makes a push for financial inclusion with jan dhan accounts. Now it is more a priority for us,"" he said.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Closure-of-over-the-counter-cash-exchanges-hits-people-in-villages-badly/articleshow/55664415.cms,

""Robust growth and low oil prices will underpin stable auto ABS performance despite the economic disruption from the demonetisation drive,"" Moody's Senior Vice-president Yian Ning Loh said in a report on Monday, adding that ABS backed by CV loans account for 45 per cent of total volume outstanding.    It expects performance of commercial vehicle (CV) loans supporting auto asset-backed securities (ABS) transactions to remain stable next year even though it expects the delinquency rates to increase somewhat in the very short term owing to the demonetisation.    ""But delinquencies should return to their current levels over the course of 2017 due to robust economic growth and low oil prices,"" says the report.    Moody's also expects new auto ABS issued in 2017 to have good credit characteristics apart from residential mortgages that should also remain strong in 2017, with low delinquencies reflecting low interest rates, steady house prices and stable prepayment rates.    Projecting a stable market, Moody's said ""robust growth and low oil prices will underpin stable auto ABS performance, despite disruption from demonetisation. Therefore, we view CV loans backing auto ABS transactions to be stable"".    It also expects residential mortgage to be strong as lower interest rates and steady house prices will help tide over the demonetisation impact.

Banking sector sources also revealed that they have been informed that large number of new currency notes were printed on Saturday and Sunday, when banks were closed. The same would be made available to them so that they can handle restive customers.    After a two-day holiday, banks across Saurashtra opened to scenes of chaos as cash-strapped people scrambled to get money, mostly in vain. Citizens, many of them aged and ill, fumed as they did not get enough money despite the central government permitting withdrawal of Rs 24,000 by cheque.    Arvind Patel, 35, a resident of Raiya Road in Rajkot, desperately needed money to get his leg operated. ""Ever since the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes became invalid, the Bank of Baroda ATM at Raiya Road is closed. I visited the bank on three working days, but have not got a single rupee,"" said Patel, who works as a driver.    Due to lack of adequate supply from RBI, many banks in Rajkot city ran out of cash within hours of opening in the morning. ""We received Rs 10 lakh last Thursday. So, we are able to give only up to Rs 4,000 to each account holder,"" said Narendrasinh Jadeja, managing director at Jeevan Commercial Bank, Rajkot.    The situation is particularly grim in rural Saurashtra where farmers are finding it difficult to withdraw cash and even sell their produce in the market because of the cash crunch.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Demonetization-Currency-supply-improves-still-way-below-demand/articleshow/55675583.cms,ahmedabad
2016-11-29 08:20:00,Demonetisation leads to highest ever surrender of Maoists in a month,"NEW DELHI: Government policies in left-wing extremism affected states, pressure built up by security forces for past few months and the latest  demonetisation decision+  seem to be making a strong impact in the region, with 564 Maoists and their sympathizers surrendering before the authorities in the last 28 days, the highest number to do so in a month ever.    While regular crackdowns by the CRPF and local police forces of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have been a contributing factor, the demonetisation of  old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes+  has also played a  substantial part in the development+  . Out of 564, officials say that 469 Maoists and their sympathisers have surrendered before the authorities since November 8 alone. More than 70% of the surrenders have happened in Malkangiri district in Odisha, where Andhra Pradesh Greyhounds killed 23 Maoists in an encounter last month.    Officials say that if the statistics of surrenders are compared with the previous months and years, such large number of Maoists and their supporters have not given up arms ever in such a short period. Since 2011, till November 15 this year, the total number of  Maoist surrenders+  stand at 3,766, according to the home ministry data. In 2016 alone, 1,399 Maoists have surrendered, highest in the last six years.    The CRPF officials say that several factors have contributed to the large scale surrenders, including government increasing development activities in the left wing extremism-affected districts and clear message to Maoists and their sympathizers. The latest demonetisation move has thwarted the Maoists as they are not able to launder the old currency stashes to their suppliers with ease, hitting their capacity to procure firearms, ammunition, medicines, commodities of daily use and pay cash to cadres, say officials in local police and CRPF.    Home minister Rajnath Singh also hinted on Friday that Maoists are making desperate attempts to survive after the demonetisation. ""They are trying to exchange their old notes through local contractors, businessmen and sympathisers,"" Singh had said in DGs/IGs conference last week.    A large number of sympathisers believe that the ideology is not bringing them any benefits, said officials. Director general of CRPF K Durga Prasad told TOI, ""Maoists are disturbed. There is no doubt about it that they are running from pillar to post.""",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-leads-to-largest-Maoist-surrenders/articleshow/55675983.cms,
2016-11-29 05:29:00,AAP conducts nationwide protest against demonetisation,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held a nationwide protest against demonetisation on Monday.    In Delhi, a 'jan samwad' was organised at Connaught Place's Central Park where senior party functionaries released a song on the impact of the note ban.    AAP's Delhi unit convener Dilip Pandey , who sang with others, accused the Centre of wreaking havoc on the lives of people. Showing pictures of some of the people who have died in the past few days, reportedly because of the impact of demonetisation, Pandey said: ""Does this woman have black money? Her husband died of a heart attack waiting at an ATM line. This is a rickshawpuller. Does he have black money? Three days a woman went to various banks but could not get Rs 4,000. She committed suicide. The Pri me Minister had said that terror funding and corruption will stop because of demonetisation.    But nothing has changed. All promises have failed and now people are worried that exchanging notes over the counter in banks has also stopped,"" Pandey said. Tourism minister Kapil Mishra said that he had initially thought that the scheme held promise but within a couple of hours after the announcement, realised that the government was clueless about the scheme. ""I first thought that the scheme may help in controlling black money but then I heard that new notes of Rs 2,000 are being introduced. Does the Centre believe that black money comes in high denomination currency? If yes, then why introduce currency of higher value? If they did not believe that then why did they do away with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes? The government clearly didn't know what was happening. It has never happened that 86% currency has been made invalid in the space of a few hours. People have lost jobs and families are eating at langars because they have no money to buy food,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/AAP-conducts-nationwide-protest-against-demonetisation/articleshow/55676506.cms,delhi
2016-11-29 08:19:00,Naveen against demonetisation: Dharmendra,"BHUBANESWAR: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said chief minister Naveen Patnaik has joined hands with the political parties opposed to demonetisation by announcing closure of schools and colleges in the state coinciding with the opposition parties' nationwide protest against the move.    ""Some political parties gave a Bharat bandh call against demonetization on Monday. Sensing that people's mood is against them, they later scaled down and announced there would be no bandh. They would only stage protest. But going an extra mile, Naveen announced closure of educational institutions for the day. It has exposed the state's anti-demonetisation mindset,"" Dharmendra told the media in New Delhi.    On November 20, Dharmendra had accused the CM of having double standard on demonetisation and accused the BJD of trying to divert its black money through cooperative banks and tribals. He was referring to Naveen's demands that cooperative banks should be allowed to exchange old currency notes and tribals allowed transactions without PAN cards.    A communication issued by the chief minister's office on Sunday evening had said educational institutions would remain closed in view of agitation programmes by various political parties. The Congress and the Left parties took out rallies and staged demonstration at various places in the state as part of, what they said, Jan Akrosh Divas (people's anger day) against demonetisation.    Dharmendra said the after his initial support to the Centre's move against black money, the Odisha chief minister has joined hands with the protesters of demonetisation. Since people running the BJD government are involved in stashing black money, the government is forced to indirectly support the anti-demonetisation stir, the Union minister said.    BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb said Dharmendra's statement is avoidable. ""The schools and colleges were closed to avoid inconvenience to the students. Our government is very clear and consistent on its stand on demonetization. Being a Union minister, Dharmendra babu should not issue such statements. Instead, the Centre must take steps to solve problems of common man during execution of the demonetisation,"" Deb said.    After the demonetisation, Naveen had welcomed the central move terming it a bold step to check black money and terror funding. However, Naveen has taken up various shortcomings in implementation of the move with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitely.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Naveen-against-demonetisation-Dharmendra/articleshow/55677538.cms,bhubaneswar
2016-11-29 13:50:00,Currency demonetisation: Meet Bengaluru’s Bunty aur Babli,"BENGALURU: He's not your typical criminal; and she, an unlikely accomplice. Yet, between the two of them, they executed one of the most sensational heists in Bengaluru - and managed to stay two steps ahead of the police. That was until Sunday night when Dominique's wife Evelyn Mary (39) decided to give herself up.    Dominique Roy, 43, the driver who fled with the cash van from KG Road with Rs 1.37 crore in it, has become an enigma of sorts — in part because Bengalureans are still queuing up outside banks post-8/11; and also because five days have passed and the Bengaluru police have been unable to nab him.    And the crime doesn't appear to have been carried out in the heat of the moment; Dominique seems to have planned the entire thing, including the escape plan.    Minutes after the robbery...    On November 23, Dominique sped away with the cash van around 1.30 pm even as two of his associates were loading cash at an ATM in KG Road. Minutes later, he abandoned the cash van near Mount Carmel College in Vasanthnagar after extracting a few cash boxes and hailed an auto-rickshaw for his house in Lingarajapuram.    Before going home, he got down near a provision store from where he borrowed a hammer and broke open the cash box in the shop. He transferred the cash into a bag and left the boxes behind in the shop. Police have questioned the shopkeeper but he said that he didn't bother to check what Dominique was doing. The boxes have been recovered from his shop.    When he returned home, Evelyn and her 10-year-old son (she is his second wife; more about that later) were waiting for Dominique. Evelyn was ready with the luggage; the couple had even sold some of their household articles a couple of days before executing the plan. They took an auto-rickshaw to Shivajinagar and had biryani at Imperial Hotel near the bus stand. They then broke their SIM cards and tossed them into a dustbin outside the hotel (police have recovered the broken SIM cards). From there, they took an auto to go to Shanthi Nagar bus stand; boarded a bus to Vellore and checked into a lodge.    The family then kept changing its location, careful not to spend too much time at one particular spot. They went from Vellore to Coimbatore; and then to Vijaywada.    Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) MN Anucheth said, ""When they were travelling Coimbatore, Dominique took a cell phone of a co-passenger in the train and called Evelyn's uncle in Vijayawada. He reportedly told Dominique that what he has done was wrong and he will not allow him in his house. The couple got down at Coimbatore and went to Evelyn's sister's house; they then took herw sister and her husband to Chalakudy in Thrissur district. All of them stayed in a lodge and on November 25 they returned to Coimbatore. The couple said that they were returning to Bengaluru and checked into a lodge.    On November 26, they reached Vijayavada via train. The couple met Evelyn's aunt and spent time till evening in the house and boarded a bus for Bengaluru. They reached the city on November 27 evening and headed straight for their lawyer.  Evelyn surrenders with the loot  On the advice of their lawyer in Bengaluru, Evelyn decided to give herself up. She approached the Banaswadi police along with her son. A total of Rs 79.08 lakh was recovered from her. Around noon on Monday, she was handed over to Upparpet police station. DCP (East) N Satish Kumar said, ""We questioned Evelyn and handed her over to the West division police where the case has been registered. The investigation is being carried out by them.""    But Dominique, it seems, is made of sterner stuff. He escaped along with Rs 13 lakh of the booty. He also has his passport with him but police believe he won't be able to get very far and will be arrested - or will turn himself in - by Tuesday, tops.  The back story  Dominique, a driver by profession, had worked as a daily wager and could not keep a job for long. He had divorced his first wife with whom he has a teenaged son.    Evelyn, an Anglo-Indian, is a divorcee too. She has a son from her first marriage. Dominique and Evelyn started living together at her house in Lingarajapuram and eventually got married recently. After the wedding, Evelyn moved to Dubai as a housemaid but had to quickly return to India as the couple she was working for started clashing over Evelyn. She returned to the city on November 1; that same day, Dominique joined Secure Transit and was deployed as the cash van driver for Logicash Solutions. He worked till November 7 and then went on a 10-day leave. On November 18, rejoined work. On November 23, he fled with the van.  How the couple stayed two steps ahead of the police  Soon after the incident was reported, the police collected basic details about Dominique and headed to his rented house in Lingarajapuram. They reached sometime after 3 pm and learnt that Dominique had locked his house and left along with his wife and her 10-year-old son.    In Thrissur too, a police team deployed to nab the couple reached the lodge a good two hours after it had left.    Soon after executing the heist, the couple broke their SIM cards and had been contacting their relatives only through coin-operated phones, thus avoiding detection.    In fact, whatever leads the police got were through phones of Evelyn's mother, who stays in Dubai. ""Dominique was not in regular contact with his family and we were sure that the couple will call Evelyn's relatives. But if we had questioned them, the couple would have been alerted,"" said a police officer.  ON THE RUNNovember 23 bus to Vellore  * Cash van driver Dominique Roy flees with the vehicle - and Rs 1.37 cr - from KG Road around 1.30 pm.    * Police reach his Lingarajapuram house sometime after 3 pm; by then Dominique, his wife Evelyn and her 10-year-old son are already on the run    * After destroying their SIMs, they board a bus to Vellore  November 24 from Vellore to Thrissur  * The family reaches Vellore, but soon decides to go to Coimbatore where Evelyn's sister and husband stay.    * All of them head to halakudy in Thrissur in Kerala on the pretext of meeting some relatives and return to Coimbatore the next day  November 25 Thrissur to Coimbatore to Vijayawada  * lBack in Coimbatore, they bid farewell to Evelyn's sister; tell her that they are returning to Bengaluru. But they check themselves into a lodge in Coimbatore.    * They board a night train to Vijayawada where Evelyn's aunt stays  November 26 from Vijayawada to Bengaluru  The couple reach Vijayawad and spend time till evening in Evelyn's aunt's house. They board a bus to Bengaluru  November 27 at Bengaluru  * They reach Bengaluru in the evening and consult an advocate, Nancy Prince, who advises them to surrender.

2016-11-29 06:13:00,Status quo at banks post 21 days of demonetisation,"Kolhapur: The long queue outside the ATMs has been a common sight for the past two weeks now. The queue seemed longer after a cash crisis weekend for the common public here. It can be anticipated that the Centre's promise for short-term cash crisis will continue for quite some time.    The banks across the city saw a heavy pour in of cash depositors and withdrawers on Monday morning.    After standing in long queues and receiving the new Rs 2,000 currency notes has added to the aggression amongst people. People are disturbed as there are no new currency notes for Rs 500 or lower denominations.    The ATMs across the city are mostly having their shutters down. Only the ATMs of State Bank of India (SBI) are opened at different locations in the city. Other ATMs are still struggling for cash.    A local resident, Arvind Chaugule said, ""There was a heavy rush at banks after the cancellation of old currencies was announced. I almost waited for two hours on Monday for cash deposit and withdrawal. It was the time consuming exercise but I was left with no option. I was thinking that banking operations will return to normal level after two weeks. But, I could see no signs improvement. The Prime Minister has demanded fifty days and I hope that things will get better for us.""    Another resident Uttam Gadgil said, ""The ATMs are filled with Rs 2000 notes and we are left with no option than to accept it. It is difficult for the people who do not have two thousand in their accounts. The new currency notes of Rs 500 are available only in bigger cities. I think the government and RBI prefer the metropolitan cities over city like Kolhapur.""    The additional collector, Nandkumar Kartkar said, ""The district has received the five pockets of new currency notes of Rs 500 which will soon be circulated among the common public. We don't know the exact amount.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/Status-quo-at-banks-post-21-days-of-demonetisation/articleshow/55673678.cms,kolhapur
2016-11-29 09:07:00,"Demonetisation: Cash drought persists in metros; banks, ATMs in cities run dry as focus turns to rural India","Banks and automated teller machines in Delhi, Mumbai and elsewhere were strapped for cash on Monday as the supply of notes by the Reserve Bank of India continued to fall short of demand, leaving those awaiting the month-end payday filled with trepidation.    While the lack of new Rs 500 notes was especially acute, bankers said currency supplies had improved from last week but not enough to meet customer requirements. Some officials speculated that the central bank may have turned its focus to the villages, where the economy is even more heavily dependent on cash and where distress could be acute since branches and ATMs are more widely dispersed than in urban areas.    Long queues were seen outside ATMs in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata while many others were out of cash despite being tweaked to dispense the new, smaller-sized Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes.    “The focus may have shifted to rural India, which is heavily dependent on cash,” said a banker. “As a result, metros and cities may be facing a cash crunch.”    Based on information from sources — RBI has not been providing daily data about supply or demand — State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank are said to have received Rs 20 crore each in Mumbai while Axis Bank received twice that. For Delhi operations, SBI, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank received Rs 21 crore each while HDFC Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce got `40 crore each.    Governor Urjit Patel told PTI on Sunday that RBI was taking all necessary steps to “ease the genuine pain of citizens”.    The decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 8 as a strike against black money, corruption, fakes and terror financing meant 86% of the currency in use ceased to be legal tender. RBI has been unable to meet demand for new notes, which is having a knock-on effect on businesses dominated by cash such as retail.    Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association that represents 100,000 shops in Mumbai, said business has suffered due to the shortage of cash. “Retailers have cancelled orders from manufacturers and wholesalers fearing poor demand,” he said.    He said almost 150 big standalone stores such as Roopam, Roopmilan, Benzer, Asiatic and Metro Shoes are willing to provide cash at point-of-sale (PoS) machines just like Big Bazaar, allowing customers to swipe cards and withdraw Rs 2,000 from their account.    “However, most of us have HDFC Bank PoS machines and there is no response from them. We have written to RBI seeking their intervention in the matter,” he said. HDFC couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.  HOLDING ON TO NOTES  Shah also pointed out that many shopkeepers and large stores are not depositing low-denomination notes with banks. “Our members are depositing Rs 2,000 notes in bank branches but holding back Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes to meet demand from customers,” he said. This has exacerbated existing shortage by keeping low-denomination currency out of circulation.    Some SBI executives said RBI supply was predominantly in the form of Rs 2,000 notes. Other bankers concurred. “There is no improvement in the situation. We are facing shortage of Rs 500 and Rs 100 currency notes,” said a senior executive at a state-run bank in South 24 Parganas, an under-developed district in West Bengal.    Sources said banks with currency chests are better positioned in terms of cash in hand. “We hold more than 50% of the nearly 4,000 currency chests across the country and we are getting currency as per our requirement,” said a senior SBI official. For instance, there are 62 RBI-owned currency chests in Mumbai, of which 19 are managed by SBI, one each by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. Similarly, in New Delhi, out of the total 59 currency chests, SBI manages 18, HDFC Bank has one, while ICICI Bank has two currency chests.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Cash-drought-persists-in-metros-banks-ATMs-in-cities-run-dry-as-focus-turns-to-rural-India/articleshow/55678561.cms,
2016-11-29 09:22:00,Demonetisation: People stock up on medicines to get rid of old notes,"MUMBAI: Three weeks after the November 8 demonetisation scheme, Indians are hoarding medicines in exchange of old notes as pharmacy chains have become one of the last stations that accept the old Rs 500 andRs 1,000 notes as legal tender.    Chemists and pharmacy chains across India have witnessed a spike in sales of chronic medicines, according to a data crunching exercise by consultancy firm AWACS on the impact of demonetisation on drug sales.    The consultancy firm analysed 2 per cent of the total pharma market as a sample size since the demonetisation drive began and dividing the segment into acute, chronic and subchronic segment, it looked at seven weeks sales starting October 11.    AWACs found that chronic therapy, which includes anti-diabetic, cardiovascular and blood pressure drugs have shown a significant increase in sales as compared to corresponding period of October.    The trend shows that since November 1, the sales of drugs in this therapy grew from Rs 14.1crore to Rs 16.8 crore.    “This clearly shows some chronic patients have used old notes to prepone their medicine supply for 2-3 months. Overall chronic therapy may gain 10-15 per cent additional sales in November,” said Ameesh Masurekar, Director of AWACS. Dharmil Seth, cofounder of PharmEasy, a e-pharmacy startup, has seen similar trend with 20-25 per cent of their customers advancing purchases.    “I think, fearing the cash crunch, people were concerned if they will have money to buy medicines, so that’s why we saw many of the regular buyers bought before time,” Seth explains.    However, as a policy, PharmEasy restricts preponed purchase of medicines unless the customers have a valid reason. But on the other side, as patients hoard chronic medicines, the sale of acute therapy drugs like regular antibiotics, among others, which makes up nearly 60 per cent of total Indian pharma market, has seen a sharp dip.    Masurekar expects the sales of acute therapy to drop by 20 per cent in November.    “It looks like people have delayed going to the doctor for their “small illness” in order to save cash.    This would have extended to their decision of buying medicines too,” Masurekar said. He is expecting drug companies with high share of acute portfolio to see a sharper dip in sales this month.    The sales of drugs in this category dropped from Rs 27. 1 crore on November 8, the day demonetisation was announced after markets closed, toRs 21.6 crore on November 22.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-People-stock-up-on-medicines-to-get-rid-of-old-notes/articleshow/55678755.cms,
2016-12-01 01:27:00,How Narendra Modi's demonetisation is weighing on sectors,"The government's decision on November 8 to immediately ban Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that account for 86% of all currency in circulation has impacted a raft of sectors. Consumers have turned frugal, causing a sharp drop in demand for goods and services. While farmers and small industries will bear the brunt and sectors like transport and real estate will visibly be in pain, several other industrial sectors will have to scale back services or production.      Also Read:    Demonetisation effect: Single screen theatres in smaller towns see fall in businessAUTOMOBILES: Life in the slow lanePOSITIVE IMPACT:  Interest rate and tax cuts soon  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  Fall in sales of two-wheelers, commercial vehicles and luxury cars  NUMBER GAME:  In November, utility vehicles sales expected to be down 40-50%, commercial vehicle sales down by 50-60% and two-wheelers 20-40%    Sales of commercial vehicles, two wheelers and luxury cars are the worst hit by the demonetisation move. Carmakers are skimping on production to streamline inventory and have reduced dealer (wholesale) targets by up to 40%.    While footfalls at dealerships across the country have dropped by 50-60%, bookings have fallen equally by 50%. Gautam Modi, a Mumbai-based Audi dealer, says sales fell by more than 45% in November. Even rural markets, which account for nearly two-thirds of entry-level motorcycle sales in the country, are in pain because vehicle purchases are done by cash.    To offset the impact, manufacturers through dealers and finance companies have started offering lower interest rates and zero down payment to push sales. RC Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest car maker, however sees this as a blip. The impact on small car sales may be minimal as most of the transactions occur through bank financing or loans. ""We have advance bookings and the waiting period for several models which will help us tide through this phase.""  HOSPITALITY/TRAVEL: The trip can waitPOSITIVE IMPACT:  Use of credit cards at national monuments, rise in digital payments  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  Cancellation and no show rate increased by 33% in fi ne dining restaurants, drop in inbound tourism; airline bookings drop, cancellations increase  NUMBER GAME:  Restaurant reservations in Delhi NCR dropped by 28%, in Mumbai by 7% and in Bengaluru by 2%    Demonetisation is weighing heavily on the tourism sector, already under stress due to the sharp escalation in pollution n India. The number of inbound tourists visiting national monuments have dropped significantly after the note ban. Almost all these places only accept cash, which leaves no option for these travellers, says Rajeev Kohli , Senior VP, Indian Association of Tour Operators.    ""This ban has almost choked the tourism industry forcing many travellers to postpone or cancel travel,"" he says. Airlines too are seeing a drop in bookings and occupancy and increase in cancellations. On Monday, SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh told a business channel that there is a visible impact of demonetisation on airlines.    Popular tourist destinations of Indian travellers such as Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Maldives, Hawaii, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, China, Indonesia and Dubai have all seen a drop in bookings. The currency ban has caused huge uncertainty and disrupted transactions for smaller hotels, restaurants and food and beverage operations, which accept cash. Restaurant reservations dropped the highest in Delhi NCR, followed by Mumbai and Bengaluru, according to an EazyDiner report.  FMCG: Demand intact, but where is the money?    POSITIVE IMPACT:    Pending dues fl owing in from wholesalers (using old currencies)  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  Rural buying power reduced  NUMBER GAME:  35-40% drop in sales expected in the interim    FMCG companies are already staring at a 20- 30% fall in sales post the note ban — and much of it is coming from rural India. Rural markets account for 40- 45% of revenue for all major FMCG/retailfocused companies.    While most analysts expect sales of essential items like soap and toothpastes to continue unhindered, categories like body cream, special body oils, deodorants, high-end shampoos, snacks and fries, chocolates, special enriched food items and ice-creams may log lower sales in the interim.    ""There's demand for these products, but people do not have enough liquidity (money) to buy them,"" says Abneesh Roy, senior VP & FMCG-retail analyst at Edelweiss Securities.    ""People mostly use cash in rural India; they don't use cards like the way people in cities do. Since most FMCG companies have a large rural portfolio, we may see some dip in their earnings over the next two-three quarters."" Most equity analysts, whom ET consulted, expect FMCG sales to drop 35 - 40% over the next two quarters. The only silver lining being the fact that many FMCG companies have managed to collect ""pending pay-ins"" (collection dues) from powerful wholesalers in old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.  BANKS-NBFCs: No time for money-spinners at this rate    POSITIVE IMPACT:    Increase in CASA deposits for most banks; lending rates to drop further  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  MFIs, NBFCs miss collection cycles  NUMBER GAME:  Banks have received deposits in excess of Rs 6 trillion since the note ban    The government's demonetisation drive may puncture the earnings of most banks this quarter. With most staffers handling the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 note deposits, exchange and withdrawals, ""revenue-yielding"" operations such as vending loans and cross-selling investment products have taken a backseat in most banks.    ""The earnings of banks may take a hit in the third and fourth quarter,"" says Siddharth Purohit, senior banking analyst at Angel Broking, a retail stock brokerage. ""We may not see loan book growth as most banks are busy facilitating the demonetisation process. They're not aggressively selling a lot of credit products now. That apart, the SME and real estate sectors, to which most banks lend a significant part of their book - are in a state of lull.""    Demonetisation will help most banks improve their CASA (current account, saving account) deposit counters, albeit not many analysts expect this money to remain in the bank for long. Flushed with cash, most banks would now be forced to cut rates - on both deposits and lending - over the next few weeks. This, in turn, may spur credit offtake in the banking sector - towards the first quarter of next fiscal.    NBFCs and microfinance institutions (MFIs) are under severe stress as their collection cycles (mostly in cash) have gone awry post November 8. Most NBFCs and MFIs have announced 'collection holidays' till such time there's sufficient money in the system.  E-COMMERCE: Fewer clicks    POSITIVE IMPACT:    Good for unit economics as Cash on Delivery down and returns drop  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  All companies hit; niche players worse off  NUMBERS GAME:  Sales down 60-70%    Of the 1 million items shipped daily from e-commerce companies, 60% are on cash-ondelivery (CoD). ""These are not getting placed. Suddenly priority for shopping is low,"" says Sreedhar Prasad, partner, ecommerce and startups, KPMG India.    While sellers say their business is down in the dumps, e-commerce companies are playing down the post-demonetisation impact. ""Customers are adopting electronic payments at delivery and this has seen 10X growth,"" says an Amazon India spokesperson.    Snapdeal says its digital wallet Freecharge has helped. A day after the decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, e-commerce companies capped CoD orders to below Rs 1,000 with all purchases above this amount to be carried out by digital wallets or cards.    Sellers have a dif ferent view. Deepak Chopra, founder of Softek Surya, a seller based in Nehru Place, Delhi, says daily shipments to portals are down to 700 from 4,000. ""I have 60 employees and monthly costs of Rs 20 lakh. My sales have dropped to less than Rs 5 lakh. How will I pay them?"" Hyderabad based seller Redlily and Jaipur based jewellery brand Dhora have also seen sharp decline in online sales.    The worse hit among e-commerce companies are the niche sellers— selling a single category like lingerie, eyewear, fashion— whose sales have dropped 60-70%. ""People are buying only essentials. Besides, the large companies are equipping their logistics staff with card readers to ease payments in delivery. Smaller companies can't afford that,"" says Prasad of KPMG.  LUXURY MARKET: Bling goes out of fashion    POSITIVE IMPACT:    Huge, immediate spike in sales. Long-term sales depend on rise in dispoable income  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  Layoffs in short term; Could take longer to stabilise as buyers wait for impact of GST & any budget proposals as well  NUMBER GAME:  Overall market drops by 50-60%    The luxury goods market already reeling under the impact of global and local issues — from weak outlook to mandatory PAN requirement for purchases topping Rs 2 lakh — got another hard knock due to demonetisation. The exception was the window between 8 pm and the wee hours of November 9 when buyers flocked to pick up expensive perfumes, scarves, watches, jewellery, smartphones (mainly iPhones) with the discontinued currency notes.    ""The immediate impact is severe,"" says Anurag Mathur, partner and retail expert, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India. Rajat Wahi, partner and head of consumer markets, KPMG India, believes there could be layoffs and the pain could last for six months. ""After two quarters, pent-up demand will push sales,"" says Wahi.    Luxury buyers could also go into hiding as they wait for the implications of GST and budget proposals. ""Some drop (in luxury sales) might be permanent even, as buyers wait to get clarity,"" says Wahi.  GOLD: The shine is lost for now    POSITIVE IMPACT:    Gold prices may fall post December  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  Gold sales reduced to a trickle  NUMBER GAME:  Price may drop below Rs 28,000 per-ten-grams post December    Zaveri Bazaar, the famed gold market of Mumbai, registers business worth Rs 125 crore on an average day. Post the noteban, this has dropped to a mere Rs 13 crore worth of sales per day. ""We don't have buyers now... all that we get are people dealing in recycled gold and some minor wedding purchases,"" says Kumar Jain, vice-chairman of the Mumbai Jewellers Association.    The jewellers of Zaveri Bazaar were hoping to make a killing this wedding season as some 29,000 marriages are slated to take place across India in November and December. To meet the demand head on, wholesale jewellers of Zaveri Bazaar had imported and stocked close to 70 tonnes of gold (as against their quarterly import average of 30 tonnes).    ""Now we're left with only stock and no buyers... People have even started rescheduling marriages - or holding simple ceremonies in courts and temples."" The demonetisation drive is expected to depress gold prices significantly. Currently trading at Rs 28,750 (per ten grams), gold prices are expected to drop below Rs 28,000 (per ten grams) post December.    Jewellers are also worried about tax raids as there are widespread reports of black money hoarders using gold to clean up their cash-in-hand (in the initial days of demonetisation).  ENTERTAINMENT: Show goes on, albeit a little slowly    POSITIVE IMPACT:    More card spending, online booking now  NEGATIVE IMPACT:  Nearly a dozen studios have delayed their (film) releases  NUMBER GAME:  Average viewership dropped to just 55 people per show in the first week of demonetisation    Entertainment sector (mostly cinema houses) could be the first one to wriggle out of hardships caused by the demonetisation drive. After two weeks of ""low business days"", things are looking up for most cinema houses as people have started using ""plastic money"" to get their weekly celluloid fix.    ""Our card-based sales of tickets and food & beverages have doubled since the noteban,"" says Siddharth Jain, director, INOX Leisure. ""For the first two weeks, people didn't have enough time to come and watch a movie as they were standing in bank queues... that period is behind us now.""    To increase footfalls, multiplex chains like Inox have set up POS machines on their premises to facilitate withdrawal of cash up to Rs 2,000 a card every day. That said, nearly a dozen studios (mostly regional banners) have delayed their film releases indefinitely, awaiting the return of cash in the patrons' wallets.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/How-Narendra-Modis-demonetisation-is-weighing-on-sectors/articleshow/55678966.cms,
2016-11-29 14:09:00,"Post demonetisation, Ayodhya temple in 'cash-22' situation","AYODHYA: A 'cash-22' situation for the Ram Lalla temple in Ayodhya -the shrine at the disputed Ramnajmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site -has been resolved with the help of the local administration. Its income in the form of offerings went up sharply .However, the catch was most of it was in demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes.The administration, therefore, came to the rescue and got the currency deposited in a bank.    The temple's records show there was a record jump in donations in the first fortnight of November after demonetisation was announced on November 8.Talking to TOI, Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest at the temple, said: ""We got offerings in 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in large numbers. It is the duty of the administration to count and deposit the money in the account of Lord Rama at the main branch of State Bank of India."" According to the temple's balance sheets, available at Manas Bhawan, the headquarters of the temple's administration, revenue records and security -its income in August was Rs 7.96 lakh, in September Rs 5.38 lakh, and in October 6.97 lakh.    However, in November, it registered Rs 6.79 lakh in the first 15 days itself. ""Our income rose, but the irony was most people used their unusable notes,"" said another priest at the temple. ""It was reported to me that old notes of 500 and 1,000 have been found in large numbers in donation boxes. We took those notes out and deposited them,"" said divisional commissioner Surya Prakash Mishra, who is also the Supreme Court-appointed receiver for the disputed site.    The donation boxes were opened in the presence of a magistrate, the chief priest and the district treasury officer at Manas Bhawan. The money was counted and deposited in the bank under tight security , said an official from the commissioner's office.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/Post-demonetisation-Ayodhya-temple-in-cash-22-situation/articleshow/55679216.cms,varanasi
2016-11-29 11:35:00,How fat Indian weddings are going on a crash diet to cope with demonetisation,"As Mumbai-based finance executive Amit Angane tied the knot with bank officer Sonal Kanse on 21 November, the relief among family members was palpable. Preparations for the wedding had been on for weeks, but the government's sudden move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes threw everything into disarray. The venue had been booked and caterers paid partly in advance, but there was little cash in hand to meet other expenses. The stingy limits set on cheque and ATM withdrawals did not help. Finally, more than a dozen friends and relatives of both families came to the rescue by queuing up at ATMs daily for a week to put together Rs 1.5 lakh in cash. This allowed the other vendors to be paid, and the wedding to go through as planned.  In pic: Amit Angane and Sonal Kanse, Mumbai    Wedding: 21 November        They roped in more than a dozen friends and relatives to stand in queue daily and withdraw money from ATMs. Between the two families, they managed to collect Rs 1.5 lakh in cash this way.    So why has demonetisation hit the wedding industry so hard? Says Sachin Singhal, CEO and Co-founder of wedding portal Bandbaajaa.com, ""The wedding industry is a cash-driven one. At least 60-70% of payments have to be made in hard currency."" Vendors like florists, decorators and musicians are wary of taking remuneration in cheques and even more reluctant to deal with digital payments.    The whammy could not have come at a worse time. As it is peak wedding season, a number of families had withdrawn large amounts of cash in notes that are now worthless.    For Ahmedabad-based Shyam Parekh's wedding to Reepal Parekh on 4 December, his parents had withdrawn Rs 5 lakh in cash in the first week of November. Now, they are running around trying to deposit the cash back in the bank and withdraw enough for the wedding at the same time. The Parekhs approached their bank to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh from their savings account, but were turned away as the branch was unsure about the guidelines. They intend to approach the bank again with a set of documents as mentioned in the RBI guidelines announced on 21 November. Till then, emergency funds kept at home in Rs 100 notes and loans from friends are being used to cope.  THE WAY AROUND  So what can families do in situations like this? According to Nikita Dogra, Co-founder of wedding planning firm Doli Saja Ke Rakhna, it might be a good idea to choose one's home, if big enough, as the venue. This would take care of a huge cost. Concentrating on quality rather than quantity when it comes to the trousseau, limiting festivities to only one day instead of three and being creative with decorations instead of opting for theme weddings are the cost-cutting ideas of Sumathy Bachchan, owner of wedding planning firm Wedding Sutras.    Trimming the guest list is another way of keeping costs down. School teacher Vandana Dhuriya and IT professional Vinod Kumar got married in Uttar Pradesh's Ambedkar Nagar district on 23 November with only 100 odd guests in attendance, instead of the planned 350, and that too after relatives pitched in with Rs 3 lakh in cash.  In Pic: Vandana Dhuriya and Vinod kumar    The couple got married only after relatives pitched in with cash and the guest list was trimmed to the minimum.    In tier I and tier II cities, one can opt for cashless options while booking banquet halls. Abhishek Kadam, Director of Ritz Banquets in Mumbai, advises, ""Opt for inhouse services offered by the venue owners as that way you deal with one entity rather than multiple unorganised vendors who insist on cash."" It may be more expensive, but the peace of mind is worth it.    Mumbai-based chartered accountant Saurabh Lakhwara has roped in his parents and sister to withdraw Rs 24,000 from each of their bank accounts every week till 9 December, the day he is tying the knot with Rashi Khetan. With the money collected so far, he has made advance payments for the venue and caterer and paid the decorator in full. As all four have their bank accounts in the same branch, one member is going every week with four cheques to stand in queue. For those who haven't yet booked the venue, Lakhwara recommends negotiating a tax inclusive package. ""Paying through cheque or RTGS to banquet halls and others invites a 15% service tax liability. However, this also ensures a clean and recorded transaction,"" he says. As Singhal points out, ""The wedding industry will become more organised in the long run, and we are seeing a huge shift from cash to digital mode of payments.""  In Pic: Saurabh Lakhwara and Rashi Khetan, Mumbai    Wedding: 9 December        Every member of Lakhwara's family has been withdrawing Rs 24,000 from their respective bank accounts every week.    Like the Lakhwaras, the Upadhyays of Junagadh are also busy withdrawing Rs 24,000 a week for their daughter Sweta's wedding to Nisarg Dave on 1 December. Though they have been planning for the last six months, shopping for clothes and jewellery are yet to be done. As most jewellers are unwilling to accept card payments, the family is hoping they would be able to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh from the bank as per the new guidelines in time for the wedding.  In Pic: Sweta Upadhyay and Nisarg Dave, Junagadh    Wedding: 1 December        Restricted shopping for trousseau to only the necessities. As jewellers in the town are unwilling to accept card payments, the bride's parents have been withdrawing Rs 24,000 from their bank accounts every week.    For those who do not want to scrimp on costs in the time of a cash crunch, wedding planners who have tied up with banks is an option. For instance, Weddingz.in has tied up with Yes Bank to provide short- term loans for customers. Some wedding planners are also game for flexible payment options like EMIs. So while the cash crisis may have thrown many a family into a tizzy, affected vendors are also changing the way they do business to stay in the game.  How to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh for your wedding1.  You must submit the wedding card to the bank and also ensure that you withdraw only from the credit balance your account contained before November 8.  2.  You must give an undertaking that those to whom you will distribute Rs 10,000 or more do not have a bank account. The recipients' names are required.  3.  The marriage must be before 30 December. The cash withdrawals can be made by either of the parents or the bride or the groom.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/How-fat-Indian-weddings-are-going-on-a-crash-diet-to-cope-with-demonetisation/articleshow/55680527.cms,

2016-11-29 12:19:00,Demonetisation effect: Single screen theatres in smaller towns see fall in business,"MUMBAI: Mukesh Kumar, a resident of Bettiah in Bihar, is a movie buff who never used to miss any movie released in his nearest film theatre.    However, he has not seen a single film since November 8, because he doesn't have cash to buy the Rs 50 ticket, thanks to the sudden demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.    The jury is still out on whether the government's demonetisation drive to combat black money will succeed, but the initiative seems to have created a digital divide in the cinema exhibition industry.  Single screen theatres in smaller towns where there is no facility for card payment have suffered a direct blow from the note ban while multiplexes claim that their business is not hit much and is bouncing back.    Most single screen owners in the country are staring at major losses with show cancellations and abysmal ticket sales. Rakesh Bairolia, who controls 35 theatres in Bihar and Jharkhand, told ET that collections are down to 15-20 per cent in his properties.    ""At many places we have revised ticket prices — balcony from Rs 70 to Rs 40, and second class from Rs 50 to Rs 30, just to get people come to watch films. But they don't have cash, so how will they come,"" he said. ""In big cities, you talk about credit cards and online payment; here we don't even have computerised ticketing in almost 95 per cent screens,"" Bairolia said.    Anil Bohra, who owns a small multiplex and a single screen property in Gujarat, said, ""We have seen over 60 per cent drop in business. Cinema is luxury spend in areas where we operate. We will have to live with the situation till things normalise,"" he said.    Incidentally, it's a double whammy for the single screen owners as producers are recalibrating film releases with limited prints considering the hard cash crunch across the country. Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Dear Zindagi', for example, was released in just 1,200 screens this Friday.    Producers of Kahaani 2 and Befikre are working on their distribution strategy to release films in less number of screens. Ashish Bhandari, joint managing director of digital cinema services company United Media-Works that offers digital delivery of cinema to 330 screens in India, said for one week post the demonetisation announcement, the occupancy of single screen theatres in smaller centres had gone down to 5-7 per cent.    ""Now it is slightly better but so far, from the logs that we have got, I can tell that more than 50 per cent shows have got cancelled because of no public,"" he said.    Ashok Dash, COO at KSS Miniplex, which operates 17 screens in smaller cities of Punjab, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Maharashtra, said, ""Our business model revolves around screens in smaller towns at affordable prices, where most of the transactions happen in cash. My occupancy has come down to 5 per cent, while operational cost remains the same. My cost of running one show is Rs 4,000 and tickets we are generating worth Rs 500-700 only.""    In fact, demonetisation has impacted the industry at a time when it releawas just coming out of an extremely poor second quarter, which saw a lot of films tanking at the box office.    ""Things had just started to look better with Shivaay and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, and this order (demonetisation) came,"" said Rahul Puri, MD at Mukta Arts, which runs Mukta A2 Cinemas in 13 cities.    ""We have seen 30-40 per cent impact on business in the last two weeks, but I hope it will be less, going forward. Our cashless transactions have improved from 8-9 per cent earlier to 14 per cent now,"" he said.    Puri said box office collection of 'Rock On 2' has been affected at least by 50 per cent. ""Same with Force 2, which would have done better in single screens, but people had no cash,"" he said.    Interestingly, multiplex operators are not perturbed with demonetisation. Siddharth Jain, director of Inox Leisure, which has partnered with SBI to allow cash withdrawals at its 106 properties across India, said his company is completely supporting the demonetisation drive.    ""Initially there was a slight dip in the footfalls, but that was more because people were busy in sorting out their finances,"" he said. But since then its cashless transactions have doubled to 70 per cent.    ""Cash transactions have gone down but cashless have doubled. We are seeing that Indians love films and with Dear Zindagi, and things are coming back to normal,"" Jain said. Gautam Dutta, CEO at PVR Cinemas, said that while first week was a bit drastic, situation is much better now.    ""Business is bouncing back, on Saturday we registered 74 per cent occupancy. When content is good, people do spend. Plus we have also doled out a lot of incentives, including up to 35 per cent discounts and complete waiver of the convenience fee, which is helping,"" he said.    ""Now 82 per cent of our transactions are cashless,"" Dutta added.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-effect-Single-screen-theatres-in-smaller-towns-see-fall-in-business/articleshow/55681236.cms,

2016-11-30 18:18:00,Demonetisation brings down sex workers’ business,"HYDERABAD: The currency ban has virtually grounded the underground sex industry with NGOs working with 60,000 sex workers in the state, including 25,000 in the capital, reporting a sharp 90% dip in business. With clients unable to shell out lower denomination notes, majority sex workers are in a fix as they neither have bank accounts to dig into savings or know alternative livelihood skills for survival in a cash-crunch economy.    The worst-hit are those who solicit clients on the street, including bus stands and railway stations. They come from villages and are often driven by poverty to take up the profession.    ""Their daily average income ranges from Rs 200 to Rs 500, but for the last 20 days, they are on verge of starvation. They don't have bank accounts to deposit old notes,"" said B Jayamma, founder of city-based Chaithanya Mahila Mandali, an award winning community-based organisation working with female sex workers (FSWs).    On the flip side, she pointed out that demonetisation could be a godsend opportunity to provide FSWs an alternative livelihood mechanism to wean them out of the profession, but rued the absence of government schemes for their rehabilitation. ""Given an alternative opportunity, many FSWs are open to the idea of quitting the profession, but are helpless,"" added Jayamma.    This is because of the limited role of Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) for HIV/AIDS prevention when it comes to helping FSWs with support from Target Intervention (TI) based voluntary organisations, ignoring other aspects of economic, social and financial security. In fact, financial security for FSWs is key to reducing spread of HIV/AIDs.    ""If FSWs are not financially secure, it would force them to have unsafe sex with customers for higher amounts, thereby raising chances of infection. But it is not possible when an FSW has financial stability with either a bank account or if she is a member of a self-help group,"" said P Purna Chandrika, state programme manager of Avahan-Swasti, an NGO working with 8,558 FSWs in four districts of Telangana.

When contacted, John Babu, additional project director, Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) said they alone cannot work for providing alternative livelihood mechanism for FSWs.

2016-11-29 14:10:00,Is your demonetised cash deposited in bank lying idle? Here's how to invest it,"With an estimated Rs 6 lakh crore deposited in bank accounts in the past two weeks, the saving bank accounts of Indians are bulging with cash. Given the restrictions on cash withdrawals, a large chunk of this money is going to stay put in bank accounts for the next few months, earning a paltry interest of 4% (6% in select banks) per year. Though the interest on the savings bank account is tax free up to Rs 10,000 per year, it's not a good idea to keep Rs 2.5 lakh idling in your bank account. The 4% interest it will earn won't be able to beat the march of inflation, which means the purchasing power of your money will come down. Of course, this money was losing value faster when it was lying in your locker as hard cash.    There are several ways you can deploy this idle money to earn higher returns without compromising liquidity or incurring high risks. Your choice will depend on how soon you need the money, your income tax bracket and your willingness to make a little effort to earn better returns.      BANK FIXED DEPOSITS    Expected returns:  6-6.5%  Liquidity:  Instant  Taxability:  Interest earned is added to total income and taxed at the normal rate applicable to investor.    The easiest way to deploy your bank balance is to open a fixed deposit, though the returns may not be very exciting. Banks have slashed the interest rates on shortterm deposits. A one-year deposit in the State Bank of India will now fetch only 4%, which is equal to what your savings bank account earns. The rates for longer term deposits are higher, but there is another problem. The interest earned on fixed deposits is fully taxable at the normal rate applicable to the investor. If you are in the highest tax bracket (annual taxable income of over Rs 10 lakh), the post-tax return will be close to 4.5%. Also, unless you have a Netbanking account, opening a fixed deposit won't be easy at a time when visiting the bank is akin to entering a war zone.    The best way out is to open a long-term deposit of 3-5 years and break it whenever you need the money. Most banks no longer levy a penalty for premature withdrawals. But you get the interest rate applicable to the period you remained invested, which is usually lower than the longer-term rate. There is also a tax problem. If the interest income exceeds Rs 10,000 in a year, the bank will deduct TDS. This is fine if your income is above the basic exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh per year. But investors in the zero tax bracket will have to file their returns to get a refund of the TDS. Or they will have to submit the Form 15 G or H to escape the TDS. The same goes for recurring deposits. Interest earned on recurring deposits is also fully taxable, but these deposits were not subject to TDS. But the rules have now been amended. This is a good time to consider opening a sweep-in bank account where any excess amount in your savings account automatically flows into a fixed deposit to earn a higher return. If you need the money and withdraw from your savings account, the fixed deposit is automatically broken.      LIQUID FUNDS AND ULTRA-SHORT-TERM FUNDS    Expected returns:  7-9%  Liquidity  : Same or next day  Taxability:  Gains taxed at normal rates up to three years. After three years, tax is 20% with indexation benefit    If you are a mutual fund investor and have fulfilled the KYC requirements, you can invest in liquid mutual funds. These are ultra-safe schemes that can deliver up to 7-8% returns in a year. The big benefit is that unlike fixed deposits, the income from mutual funds is treated as capital gains and taxed at a lower rate if the investment is held for at least three years. They are also more flexible. You can withdraw small amounts whenever required or invest more when you have surplus cash. Most mutual fund houses offer online investment facilities and the entire process takes just 40-45 minutes. The risk of losing money in a liquid fund is almost negligible. The investment is also very liquid. If you redeem before the cut-off time (usually 12.30 pm), the money is in your bank account the next morning. Some funds even transfer money the same day. There is no minimum investing period so you won't be penalised if you invest today and redeem next week.      SHORT-TERM DEBT FUNDSExpected returns:  8-9%  Liquidity:  Next day  Taxability:  Gains taxed at normal rates up to three years. After three years, tax is 20% with indexation benefit    Those who don't need the money for the next 8-10 months should go for shortterm debt funds. These are also debt schemes, but invest in a mix of short-term and medium-term bonds. The returns are slightly higher than what liquid funds and ultra short-term debt funds give, but there is also an exit load payable if you redeem your investment before a minimum period that ranges from 3 months to 12 months. In some cases, the minimum investment period can be up to 36 months. Check the exit load of the income fund before you invest, otherwise a penalty of 0.5-1% can pare your returns. With interest rates expected to decline, these shortterm debt funds can give attractive returns in the short (2-3 months) and medium term (8-12 months). Even in the long term (over 3 years), these funds will deliver better post-tax returns than fixed deposits. Held for the long term, these funds can be effective replacements of fixed deposits. However, keep in mind that these funds also carry an interest rate risk. Right now, these schemes have given good returns because interest rates have been consistently declining. If interest rates rise (which they are unlikely to), these funds can decline, resulting in losses for the investor.      ARBITRAGE FUNDS    Expected returns  : 7-8%  Liquidity:  Two days  Taxability:  Gains taxed at 15% up to 12 months. After one year, taxfree    Investors who can hold for one year should go for arbitrage funds because they offer tax-free returns. These funds invest in stocks and equity instruments but don't carry the market risk. Like stocks and equity funds, the gains are taxed at 15% if redeemed within one year. After one year, the gains are tax-free. Check the exit load of the arbitrage fund before you invest, otherwise the penalty of 0.5-1% can pare your returns.      MONTHLY INCOME PLANS    Expected returns:  8-10%  Liquidity:  Two days  Taxability:  Gains taxed at normal rates up to three years. After three years, tax is 20% with indexation benefit    If you can stomach a little risk, monthly income plans (MIPs) from mutual funds can be a low-risk entry point to the equity markets. MIP schemes follow a conservative investment strategy, allocating only 10-25% of their corpus to equities and putting the rest 75-90% in safer bonds and other debt instruments. Their returns are better than debt funds, though they also carry a moderate risk. These funds have exit loads so check the terms and conditions before you invest.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Is-your-demonetised-cash-deposited-in-bank-lying-idle-Heres-how-to-invest-it/articleshow/55683169.cms,
2016-11-30 00:27:00,Demonetisation powers online food delivery,"Pune: Representatives of online food ordering portals and mobile applications seem to be overwhelmed by the number of orders due to the cash crisis.    Delivery trips have risen sharply with people choosing to order food online in a bid to escape paying cash at restaurants and cafes.    ""The trips have surely increased. There are around 1,500 representatives of Swiggy working to deliver food in different areas of Pune. After demonetization, there was a slump in the orders. For the first few days, I was delivering two to three orders a day as against the earlier seven to eight deliveries. However, later, there was a jump and now, on an average, I am doing around 14 to 15 deliveries each day in the Kalyaninagar area alone,"" said the representative, who requested anonymity.    Another representative of the same company, who works in the NIBM Road area, pointed out that the initial slump was due to confusion among people. ""The announcement was sudden and completely new to people. Initially, people were perplexed, not knowing what to do. But now, the idea seems to have sunk in and people know how to save the cash they have. As a result, the number of deliveries has increased. Interestingly, apart from youngsters and singles, we are even delivering food to families as well,"" the representative said.    Ratul Singh, who works in a private company and shares his apartment in Koregaon Park with two flatmates, claimed that these days breakfast ordering slots have become hard to find. ""We have ordered earlier from food delivery companies like Swiggy and Food Panda. But, nowadays it is different considering the fact that if one goes to the mobile application and checks the eateries, especially in the morning hours, there is a notification claiming the representatives are busy and food cannot be ordered from the restaurant. On Tuesday too, we could find only two restaurants that were open to deliveries and had representatives free,"" he said.    According to Singh, this continued for around half an hour before things got back to normal. Earlier, this was never the case and placing orders was an easy job. ""The fact that representatives are busy shows that their work has increased. However, ordering food and paying online is better than spending the cash in hand as the conditions have remained the same, more or less,"" Singh stated.    A representative of a restaurant, specializing in north Indian cuisine, located at Koregaon Park confirmed that online orders have increased. ""We provide home delivery system but not an online payment system. The people belonging to the delivery companies have a tie up with us and they are surely more visible these days. Though one cannot divulge numbers, their deliveries have certainly shot up and one or more representatives are present here waiting to pick up orders almost all the time,"" the representative said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Demonetisation-powers-online-food-delivery/articleshow/55694618.cms,pune

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol Thirumavalavan presided over the protest called by the party and its allies at K Pudur while DMK and its allies staged a demonstration at Palanganatham area.    Addressing the protesters, Thirumavalavan said the central government has created an emergency-like situation with the demonetisation move. ""Poor people are struggling to deposit money in banks, while the move seems to have had no impact on black money hoarders. Ordinary people are forced to stand in long queues to get money from banks and ATMs. The new currency notes are not available in many places. Micro and small-scale merchants are the worst affected,"" he said.    Thirumavalavan demanded the central government to roll back the demonetisation move. Former CPM MLAs Nanmaran, Annadurai and VCK party functionaries participated in the protest.    Meanwhile, a DMK-led demonstration condemned the government for not making alternate arrangements ahead of the demonetisation announcement. In Tuticorin, DMK MLA Anitha Radhakrishnan led the protest at Tiruchendur. ""Demonetisation has affected the working class like fishermen and farmers,"" she said.

Post-demonetisation, temples across Andhra Pradesh have struck gold -big time in the last three weeks.    A conservative estimate of the endowments department says hundi collections since November 9 are set to record a whopping Rs 180-200 crore. A senior endowments official told TOI that major shrines, including Srisailam, Simhachalam, Vijayawada Kanaka Durga, Ahobilam, Mantralayam, Kotappakonda, Srikalahasti and Dwaraka Tirumala, have witnessed a huge rise in hundi revenue after demonetisation of high denomination notes.    Curiously, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams officials asserted that there wasn't any abnormal surge in hundi offerings. ""Our hundi collection, on an average, is between Rs 2.5 crore and Rs 3 crore per day. The collection was normal except for a day in the last three weeks when it swelled to Rs 4.15 crore,"" a TTD official told TOI.    As Tirumala is a major pilgrim destination, daily counting takes place. But at several other temples, it's not the same.    ""We will get a clear picture by December-end. Howe ver, there is a steep increase in hundi collections in all the temples,"" a senior official said. A part of the increased hundi offerings could be attributed to Karthika Masam, he stated. Since the old high denominations are accepted in banks for deposits till December 30, endowments officials said the trend will continue till then.    ""Due to demonetisation, temples saw an unprecedented rise. On an average, there is 20 per cent increase and the trend is likely to continue till December 30,"" said K B Venkateswara Rao, endowments assistant commissioner, Guntur district.    Meanwhile, all the revenue generated at temples is being sent to various banks to ease cash crunch.

2016-11-30 04:00:00,"AIA undeterred by Tata battle, demonetisation","Hong Kong: Asian insurer AIA, the world's second largest by m-cap, will scale up its business in India undeterred by either the boardroom battle at its joint venture partner Tata or the heat and dust of demonetisation. AIA, which was spun off from the AIG Group through a nearly $18-billion IPO in 2010, has emerged as the largest pan-Asian insurer.    In an interview to TOI, William Lisle, regional chief executive, AIA, said that the Indian joint venture Tata AIA Life Insurance has moved up ten positions in rankings to become the sixth largest life insurance company. ""Looking at the Tata brand, we should be among the top three players. In the life business, we had some stop-starts. A key part of that was not having a bancassurance partner. But we turned that corner by partnering Citi and IndusInd Bank. We are still a bit away from the top three or four, but we are building the right foundations,"" said Lisle.    On the ongoing boardroom tussle in Tatas, Lisle said, ""We do not have any concerns. We are in partnership with the Tatas and we trust them to take the right decisions.""    Lisle sits on the Tata AIA board along with Ishat Hussain, finance director, Tata Sons. ""We have been around for 100 years and Tatas have been around for more than a 100 years. From our perspective, this is very much business as usual,"" said Lisle.    On demonetisation, Lisle said that it was a bold move. ""Prime Minister Modi is still popular. Although growth slowed slightly this year, 7.3% is a rate that the West would die for. Despite challenges, we see the growth drivers for the Indian economy continuing. There is huge opportunity akin to China, GST is expected to come in and that is expected to improve longer term public finances. I think demonetisation will have a short-term impact potentially on growth, but longer term it is the right thing for the economy,"" he said.    Speaking on plans for India, Lisle said that AIA plans to bring its new product AIA Vitality into the Indian markets. AIA Vitality brings the concept of shared values by rewarding policyholders for staying healthy. There are three aspects to insurance plans under the Vitality programme. The first part involves getting the insured to undergo regular tests and diagnostics.    In the second part, the company tells the insured what they need to do to get health and measure their adherence to an exercise regime through connected devices. If the insured achieves the goals, he is rewarded with discounts and deals. ""The healthier our clients are, the lesser they claim. We pass our savings to them in the form of discounts,"" said Lisle. The company is also bringing its group protection solutions and has started working with TCS.

2016-11-30 03:22:00,Demonetisation makes it bittersweet for jaggery mkts,"MADURAI: The major jaggery markets in Palani, Pilikalpalayam and Sithodu have come to a standstill, with each incurring losses of over 1 crore per month due to the demonetisation drive. Traders say that they are not in a position to pay sugarcane farmers for their produce.    Uncertainty prevails in the market, said joint secretary of the Tamil Nadu jaggery Merchants Association K Kamaraj. ""Future looks bleak as each of these markets used to trade jaggery worth not less than 1 crore every month. Only when the new currency notes come into circulation and we are able to give them freely and operate current accounts, will we be able to open the markets again,"" he said.    Sugarcane farmers are already affected by the drought condition and sugar mills are yet to pay them their dues. ""The government should at least have taken steps to create awareness among the common people in villages about using debit cards and bank transaction before making the announcement. It will take many years for ordinary farmers to conduct bank transactions using cards and cheques,"" Kamaraj told TOI.    Jaggery made from sugarcane juice is in demand in Kerala, where it is an essential commodity and also in Tamil Nadu during the festival season. Farmers bring their produce directly to the markets in Palani. As most of them are illiterate, they don't have debit cards or cheque books and always demand cash. Traders, who have not been able to pay the farmers, have called for the closing of the markets.    Secretary of the Palani jaggery Market Traders Association Jahir said that with the festival season expected to start in December, they would be severely affected due to demonetisation. ""jaggery auction is held on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but as the traders could not give the farmers their money, most of them took back their produce and as a result, the traders decided to close the market indefinitely. If the cash flow is not restored, we would have to put off the reopening of the market,"" he said.    A bundle of 30 kilograms of jaggery called 'sippam' is selling for about 1,500 as it is the off-season. But, next month, the supply usually increases and price goes down to about 900. The demand will be high as people use them for making Pongal and other sweetmeats. The Sabarimala season is also contributing to the increased demand as about 10,000 sippam are sold every week. This Diwali season, 25,000 sippam were sold.    When it was announced that the old 500 and 1,000 notes would not be accepted, the traders had tried to pay the farmers for the first two weeks, but now it has become impossible.    ""The traders are giving us 2,000 notes for which we have no change. What will we do with them?"" asked T Palani, a farmer. He is among the farmers who will stop cutting sugarcanes till the markets start.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/Demonetisation-makes-it-bittersweet-for-jaggery-mkts/articleshow/55696012.cms,madurai

2016-11-30 14:52:00,"Demonetisation fallout: Brakes on Kolkata luxury car sales, not a single booking this November","KOLKATA: The rich in Kolkata have suddenly lost the appetite for luxury cars. There has been no new booking since the evening of November 8 when PM Narendra Modi announced the scrapping of high value currency notes. By contrast, dealers of Mercedes, Audi, BMW , Jaguar, Volvo and Porsche had clocked sales of around 170-200 fancy wheels valued at over Rs 60-70 crore last November.    ""This November has been the worst ever for the automobile business, particularly those in the luxury car business. There is simply no comparison with any month of any year in recent memory . We have not had a single customer walk in to even express interest. Worse, there have been some cancellations of bookings made before November 8,"" said Sandeep Bajaj, whose family has dealerships for German luxury brand Audi and high performance sports car Porsche.    Binod Agarwal, who owns the Jaguar Land Rover dealership in Kolkata, was on a roll since the introduction of Jaguar F-Pace this October, the brand's first SUV . Bookings zoomed.And then, it stopped abruptly like an accelerating car smashing into a concrete wall. Binod Agarwal said, ""The luxury carmarket in Kolkata has evaporated. So pre-occupied is everyone with the liquidity crunch and meeting the expenses of daily necessities that a luxury car purchase is not on anyone's mind. They will be back once the crunch eases. But there is still uncertainty when that will happen.""    Around 8-10% customers who paid a portion in cash are now not eligible to use the money . Sources said cash customers had declined with the roll-out of Income Declaration Scheme (June 1 to September 30, 2016). An auto industry analyst said the impact on Kolkata was worse as its rich, who had always been averse to brazen display of wealth, had retreated into a cocoon and would take long to re-emerge. ""Kolkata's HNIs used to be conservative in their spends. That was gradually changing. But with the spotlight now back on big ticket spends, they will burrow deep,"" he said.    Families of India's top industrialists--Birlas, Goenkas and Mittals--in Kolkata are expected to resume the purchases after the initial storm blows over. But businessmen, top executives, actors, advocates and doctors will take longer to start spending.    BMW dealer Charchit Mishra says the short-term pain will be more than compensated by cleaner transactions in long run.""Around 90% of car sales are financed, and hence, through the banking channel. This segment will increase further,"" he said. He is tight-lipped about numbers but sources said like Audi, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, BMW had received no new bookings since November 8. The scene is no different at Porsche. In fact, most dealers are now stranded with nearly 30-45 days' advance stock of 40-50 cars. In all, the current inventory of luxury cars in Kolkata is pegged around Rs 65 crore.    ""Demonetisation has slowed down sales. But we remain bullish on the market's growth in the long-term,"" said Roland S.Folger, managing director and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Brakes-on-Kolkata-luxe-car-sales-not-a-single-booking-this-November/articleshow/55697877.cms,kolkata

Delivering the 13th Nani Palkhivala Memorial Lecture organised by Sastra University on Tuesday, Gurumurthy said there would be short-term suffering for all.The challenge before the Modi government is to see how to finance small businesses.Mudra Bank and NBFCs should be co-opted and more than 1 lakh delivery points of credit opened,"" he said.    Terming low inflation and low interest rates absolute necessities, he said the November 8 demonetisation of high value currency notes will drive healthy growth. ""It will be a huge challenge for the government,"" he said.    The Modi government had launched Mudra Bank in April 2015 to provide last-mile credit facilities to small businesses. The bank ran into issues with RBI on repayment of loans and regulations.""The government didn't get cooperation from the RBI,"" Gurumurthy said. ""RBI was egoistic and arrogant, Mudra should have preceded demonetisation.""    The demonetisation programme would help remove black cash from the system.""Black cash leads to creation of black money. The current programme will eliminate black cash,"" he said.    Cash as a proportion of GDP which was 9.4% in 1999 rose to 12% now. While in the US it is 7.5% to 8%. ""In 2004 the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes constituted 34% of cash; now it has risen to 87%. If we did not remove this black cash, we will never be able to do it,"" he said.    He said under the UPA, the economy grew by 8.4% and only 2.7 million new jobs were created. Under the Vajpayee-led NDA government, while the GDP growth was 5.5%, 60 million new jobs were created. All the money went towards gold buying, real estate and stocks and shares. ""This is asset inflation. The present government is breaking asset inflation and the jobless growth path of the UPA,"" he said.    The benefits of demonetisation includes end to terror funding and fake currencies.""Life in J&K is returning to normalcy now. How? They do not have access to fake money to throw stones at Indian soldiers,"" he said.

2016-11-30 15:18:00,Demonetisation silently changing the way the country does financial transactions,"Sundara Pandiyan, a manager at Chandra Transport in Sivaganga in Tamil Nadu for years has been repaying his company's truck loan instalment to Shriram Transport Finance Ltd in cash. The scramble for cash after Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes did turn his life upside down, for the better. He now has downloaded the MYSTFC app and his banker has taught him how to do net banking, and after initial hiccups, he feels liberated.    Millions of citizens are being put through the hardship of waiting endlessly in front of ATMs and bank branches. But the struggle for cash may also be silently changing the way the country transacts as the dematerialisation of shares did to stock trading in the mid-90s.  Also read:Demonetisation: How technology comes to the rescue of Bengaluru  From Sivaganga to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, businesses are adapting to the new reality that cash may no more be the king. The adoption of digital banking is accelerating and some of those who are reluctant are hoping for those good old days to return even as they lean on neighbours to take payments on their behalf by swiping the plastic cards at their businesses. ""When I did it for the first time, I found it a bit difficult and strange, but now I guess it is going to be easy,"" says Pandiyan. ""I think that this move is going to be beneficial for us.""    Shriram Transport Finance, which gets about half of its payments and disbursals in cash, has also realised that life may not be the same and has come to recognise that digital is the way to go. And for the first time in 35 years, customers are keen to buy the theory. ""We have created the MYSTFC app and expect a number of people to go up during such times,"" said Umesh Revankar, managing director of Shriram Transport Finance Company. ""Big operators were using online payment gateways to repay their loans.""    Restaurants and tourist guides in the remote desert town of Jaisalmer are coming up with indigenous ways to overcome the cash crunch. Narendra Purohit, a tourist guide, didn't even blink when a tourist said he did not have cash to pay for his services. ""Don't worry sir, the guy who is running the handloom shop is my friend and you can swipe your card there,"" said Purohit. ""I would get my money. We all trust each other.""    An increasing number of people have been turning to digital payment solutions in order to overcome the cash shortage. Various finance institutions have been on the lookout for ways to increase repayments through use of plastic money and digital wallets.    The Reserve Bank of India and the government have been pushing digital payments and fees on debit card usage has been waived.    Banks have been promoting point of sales and pre-paid cards. Ordeal has been the order of the day and even seasoned businessmen did not know what hit them.    ""The whole thing did not sink in and I could not comprehend it at first,"" said Samit Ghosh, managing director of Ujjivan Financial Services. ""We went to office and informed our employees that Rs 500 and Rs 1000 would not be legal tender.""    MFIs with different repayment cycles have given leeway to its customers. Ujjivan had deferred its centre meeting and asked all its customers to take time to pay.    It asked all its senior people to talk to people in branch and gauge their reaction. It only started collection from November 14 and was better than anticipated.    But they have come to grips with the reality. ""We visited branches in Delhi and rural Haryana,"" said Ghosh. ""Surprisingly, people were happy. They felt this is the sacrifice that they are making for the country even if people were queued up for 14-18 hours.""    Businesses plunged and there were temptations for some workers to find out novel ways to circumvent.    There are stories of how people are working overtime to convert their ill-gotten wealth into legitimate wealth. But there are others who resisted the temptation.    ""We said business may get affected, but we will not accept any old note,"" said George Anthony, managing director of UAE Exchange. ""It turned out to be a very good decision. The Enforcement Directorate raided our 10 offices across the country. Over the next four days, our business went to zero.""    Professor JR Varma of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and a former member of Sebi board has argued that it is credit that matters for the economy and not cash. As long as credit flows, economy should be able to overcome the cash crunch, he wrote in his blog.    Abdul Gani, a taxi driver in Udaipur, did not hesitate to comfort his potential customer about the cash crunch. ""Don't worry sir, just land here. You can transfer funds to my bank account, or if you can't, I can take even a cheque.""    But the transformation from a predominantly cash society to digital world may not necessarily be a long way off, given the need to adopt due to the crunch, say experts such as PN Vasudevan, founder of Equitas Holdings, which began its small bank business.    ""Attitudes and behaviour are changing,"" says Vasudevan. ""My cook did not know that debit cards could be used in shops and there is no charge on that.

However, this year so far many filmmakers have postponed their visits for the shooting of their respective films. Many are on wait and watch mode and are re-working and re-scheduling their visits to the state. Even, producer-director Milan Lutheria who had earlier planned visit to Rajasthan along with his crew on the first week of November had to postpone it for a month and finally arrived in Jodhpur on Wednesday.    From shooting of title track of Abbas-Mustan thriller Ajnabee to Rakyesh Omprakash Mehta's Rang De Basanti, the filmmakers always came with their lights and camera during November to February with their films which were canned in Rajasthan. However, post demonetization producers felt it was difficult for them to arrange for junior artistes to be used in various sequences of film many films were postponed.    An owner of a firm dealing with the film crews and helps them in getting permissions for shooting and other logistic support on if demonetization has taken the toll of film shootings, said, ""Usually for junior artistes, the background crowd and things like generators the producers have to pay on day-to-day basis and the amount is not more than Rs 800 to Rs 1000 per person and it is paid in cash. Thus, many filmmakers who had earlier sought time for December have now asked us to wait until things normalize. Some of them even asked if we can arrange for their money exchange in Rajasthan which is not possible for us.""    Milan Luthria who had announced his upcoming film Baadshaho arrived with his crew in Jodhpur after a delay of almost a month. The shooting will begin from December, 1.    ""As far as I am concerned they had planned for it to start by November first week. However, It appears that post demonetization many things relating to finance were reworked. For many petty things you need to pay in cash for example to the junior artistes, local coordinators etc. I firmly believe that many others who intend to shoot in Rajasthan must be on ""wait and watch"" mode for the time being. I think demonetization is a good move and slowly things are settling down,"" said Raj Bansal, a leading film distributor who is been associated with Milan Luthria for almost two decades and had distributed his films like Kachche Dhaagey and Once Upon a time in Mumbai.    A producer who had planned shooting of his film in Udaipur in December on the condition of anonymity, said, ""The lights during winters add to the beauty of a shot we are taking at any location in Rajasthan.

2016-11-30 11:01:00,Ever wondered what happens to demonetised currency? Read to know,"MUMBAI: Ever wondered where the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes you surrendered at the bank land up after they are tallied against pay-in registers of banks?    Stacked in neat bundles inside armoured trucks in the presence of gun-toting security personnel, these are ferried to shredding centres operated by the Reserve Bank in various parts of the country.    Once the notes are shredded, the fine bits are transported in gunny bags to a small band of dealers for recycling, or to make briquettes.    This time most of the newly demonetised currency notes will reach the yards of Western India Plywood (WIPL) on the banks of Valapattanam river in Kannur, Kerala, for pulping.    ""We've received over 140 tonnes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000-rupee notes for pulping over the past three weeks,"" said PK Mayan Mohamed, managing director at WIPL.    The 70-year-old manufacturer of plywood, hard boards and laminates was handpicked by RBI a few days prior to the note ban on November 8.    ""They (RBI) gave us a trial mandate with some 10-15 bags of shredded soiled notes; we turned that into usable pulp in a jiffy,"" said Mohamed. ""Convinced with our processes they retained us, promising larger consignments of shredded notes for pulping...but we had no wind of what was coming,"" he guffawed.    While RBI wants WIPL to accept more quantities of shredded notes, the company has limited its intake to about 40 tonnes a week. For every tonne, it pays a scrap value of Rs 250 to RBI.    What has worked in WIPL's favour is the presence of a high-energy Swedish-make pulping press.    Powered by a 2500 KW motor, the press dry-crushes tonnes of wood chips and other recyclables in a matter of minutes. ""Our currency notes are made of top quality paper, which...cannot be recycled in normal presses owned by newsprint or craft paper companies,"" said Mohamed, an alumnus of Lawrence School, Udhagamandalam (Lovedale, Ooty) and College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram.    At WIPL, the note shreds are mixed with wood chips thoroughly before turning the pile into the mammoth press. Out of every 100 kg of pulp compound pressed, only 7 kg is shredded notes; the rest is wood chips. The company intends to stick to this ratio even though its yards are stacked with tonnes of shredded currency notes. ""This is because we don't want to corrupt the fibre density of our pulp. We make a lot of durable products using this pulp,"" Mohamed said.    Till about a few decades ago, central banks around the world used large incinerators to burn soiled notes. This practice stopped when central bankers became aware of the pollution and heat these incinerators released.    Nowadays most central banks make 'briquettes' out of soiled notes. Briquettes are made by compressing shredded (granular) soiled notes into a thick mass - varying in size, but mostly cylindrical in shape. Large-sized briquettes weigh as much as 600 kg per cubic metre.    ""Currency scrap dealers typically use chemicals to turn shredded notes into briquettes. We don't use any chemicals...we just hard press the mix to produce tight pulp,"" Mohamed said.    Briquettes are used to manufacture soft boards, fire up furnaces, or for landfilling purposes. RBI may not want to sell a lot of briquettes (for landfilling) as it is perceived to be ecologically harmful.    ""Inks and additives used on notes — and chemicals used while briquetting — may have adverse effect on the land in the longer run,"" said the owner of a company that specialises in 'currency disintegration'.    ""This is, perhaps, the reason why RBI has tendered out the (note destruction) mandate to a plywood company,"" the person said.    WIPL, having an annual turnover of Rs 150 crore, is one of the very few hard board manufacturing companies in South India. The company also makes different types of plywood, wooden slats, furniture and home fixtures, and wooden flooring material in its 40-acre factory complex. It consumes 200 tonnes of pulp every day.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Ever-wondered-what-happens-to-demonetised-currency-Read-to-know/articleshow/55699714.cms,
2016-12-01 11:00:00,Pensioners too face the demons of demonetization,"NAGPUR: It's just not the salaried class who are facing problems to withdraw their money. Even the pensioners are going through a harrowing time. While some are complaining, a few are ready to endure the pain of standing in queues repeatedly.    On Wednesday, TOI met retired BSNL employee MT Jacob who after standing in queue at Katol Road post office, was refused his pension amount of Rs25,000 on presenting a cheque for the same. Citing the withdrawal limit of Rs24,000 per week, the postal staff asked him to come again for remaining 1,000 bucks. ""As my cheque was not accepted, I had to fill up a withdrawal slip. At least pensioners should be exempted from such withdrawal limits and paperwork formalities as they are not physically capable to cope with it,"" he said.    Another government servant Ghanshyam Ramchandani, 71, also faced similar problems at Uppalwadi post office. ""I had to stand in a queue for two hours as the post office's software link had failed. Finally when my turn came, I was given Rs24,000 and called back after seven days to collect remaining Rs1000. I am not fit enough to go and stand in lines again and again"" he said. Ramchandani was handed over 12 notes of Rs2,000. ""I requested them to give some 100 rupees notes as it is very difficult to get change against Rs2000. But the staffers said this was th only currency available,"" he added.    On Monday around 9am, 74-year-old Gayatri Chakraborty went to a nationalized bank in Jai Prakash Nagar to withdraw her late husband's pension who was an officer in ordinance factory. She too did not get full pension amount as the bank ran out of cash within an hour of opening. ""There was no separate counter for pensioners but the staffers moved me ahead in line. However, I could only withdraw Rs10,000 as the cash got over at 10.30am,"" she said. As a result, Chakraborty had to go the bank again on Tuesday morning. ""I withdrew another 10,000 rupees after which the cash counter was closed. Many pensioners had to return empty-handed,"" she added.    Not every bank is being considerate towards senior citizens. On Wednesday afternoon, 77-year-old Pushpa Desai found herself waiting in a bank along with rest of the salaried people. ""I have taken a token and have been waiting for more than an hour to collect my pension. Young salaried employees are being called before me. Pensioners are not getting any special privilege,"" said Desai. She added that all banks and post-offices should open a separate counter for pensioners.    Even senior citizens whose pension is directly linked to bank accounts are facing hassles. ""My pension was deposited on Tuesday but till today I am unable to withdraw it as all the ATMs near my house are out of cash. Even for buying groceries, we have to travel long distances and go to stores like Big Bazaar which are accepting debit cards. It is very difficult for senior citizens to undergo such physical strain,"" said Arvind Dhemre, retired senior officer of railways.

2016-11-30 09:06:00,"Demonetisation: With RBI ‘rationing’ cash, queues unlikely to shorten quickly","MUMBAI: Banks played down expectations of a dramatic improvement in currency availability, raising the prospect of queues lengthening as salaries get paid and people look to withdraw money from their accounts.    While much of India has become habituated to the sight of people lining up at banks and cash dispensers since the November 8 demonetisation announcement, bank officials said the message from the Reserve Bank of India is that supplies may not get any easier in the near future and that they should push digital transactions.    “We had sought a hearing with RBI as we were not allocated enough cash, but we were told that rationing of cash may continue for some time,” said a banker who was present at one of several meetings with central bank officials.    “Reserve Bank has asked us to push the use of digital channels to all our customers and ensure that we bring down use of cash in the economy,” said a banker.    Bankers have been making several trips to the central bank’s headquarters in Mumbai to get a sense of whether currency availability will improve.    Some automated teller machines haven’t been filled even once since the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes ceased to be legal tender, they said.    Typically, households pay milkmen, domestic helps, drivers, etc, at the start of the month in cash. The idea is that all these payments should become electronic, using computers or mobiles, said two people familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified.    The RBI spokesperson did not respond to ET’s query.    The central bank has said the banking system has received more than Rs 8 lakh crore in deposits and by way of exchange of the invalid Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. There’s no data on the value of new currency — in Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes — printed and distributed across the nation. The Prime Minister’s initiative was aimed at tackling black money, counterfeit notes, corruption and terror financing.    Following the rush to deposit and swap old notes, the government pushed through legislation on Tuesday aimed at giving people with black money yet another chance to come clean on unaccounted wealth.    Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence suggested many retailers are accepting old notes after their business suffered in markets where goods are traded mostly for cash and rarely paid for by card.    In an interview to PTI last week, RBI Governor Urjit Patel said the central bank was monitoring the situation on a daily basis and urged people to start using debit cards and digital wallets. This will make transactions cheaper and easier, helping India reduce the use of cash and bring it on par with developed nations, he said.    Since the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills ceased to be legal tender, banks have tried to convince customers to use Internet banking, mobile banking, cards, e-wallets and digital money transfers.    Industry estimates suggest that while transactions at point-of-sale devices have gone up 300%, the registrations for mobile and Internet banking have seen a twofold rise. In his monthly customary radio address on the weekend, PM Modi called for a “cashless economy”.    While such a transformation was not possible overnight, he appealed to the people to work toward it by being part of a “less-cash” society as soon as possible.    “Learn how this digital economy works. Learn the different ways you can use your bank accounts and Internet banking. Learn how to effectively use the apps of various banks on your phones. Learn how to run your business without cash,” Modi had said.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-With-RBI-rationing-cash-queues-unlikely-to-shorten-quickly/articleshow/55698588.cms,
2016-12-01 08:41:00,"Currency demonetisation: Out of cash, banks pass the buck","NEW DELHI: Whatever preparations the banks had made for managing 'salary day' on Wednesday fell well short of expectations. By the afternoon, most banks across the capital had given up, claiming they were left with no cash to disburse. And as ATMs too ran dry, bankers lamely blame the Reserve Bank of India for the short supply of currency notes.    There were flustered customers everywhere. David Ralte a pastor in South Delhi, rushed from banks in Vasant Kunj to others in Green Park to withdraw his salary. Not only did he find it hard to get cash, but he was informed at a SBI branch that the withdrawal limit had fallen from Rs 24,000 to Rs 10,000 a week. ""It is being done for a good cause, but neither the government nor the public were ready for demonetisation,"" he observed.    Areas in east Delhi fared no better. The ATMs at Laxmi Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase 1 and Pandav Nagar remained mostly non-functional, with banks falling back on their usual excuse of not receiving cash from RBI. Even outlets that had commendably dispensed cash in the last 22 days, unlike many others, were forced to put up ""No Withdrawal"" notices on Wednesday. ""We never ran out of cash for three weeks, though sometimes the money reached us late,"" said an official at the Union Bank in Connaught Place. ""Today the bank official came empty handed because RBI did not give them cash.""    Amid this, there was consternation for Jan Dhan account holders after RBI set a monthly withdrawal limit of Rs 10,000. Kamal Shah, an office help, regretted putting all his money in his Jan Dhan account in the Oriental Bank of India at Deer Park. ""How can my family survive on Rs 10,000?"" he argued. ""How can the government collectively punish us for some people depositing cash for somebody else?""    Wednesday's events also signalled dark days ahead, when thousands of elderly citizens will line up to collect their pensions. Hans Raj Singh, barely able to stand, was being helped into the Bank of India at Safdarjung Enclave by his aide Parvinder. ""We want to get a cheque book to ease the process of cash withdrawal. But we dread to think what will happen next week. The banks couldn't deal with seniors during the earlier exchange process,"" Parvinder said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Out-of-cash-banks-pass-the-buck/articleshow/55714413.cms,delhi
2016-11-30 11:09:00,Sowing season hit by demonetisation: Central team red-flag loss of rural jobs,"NEW DELHI: The 81 bureaucrats, who were dispatched by the Centre in teams of three to study the impact of demonetisation on the ground, have red-flagged loss of livelihood in rural areas, particularly in the non-formal sectors, and highlighted the negative impact on the farm sector in the sowing season.    Officials told ET that these confidential reports were submitted last week and are now being examined for further action. These teams, each led by an Additional Secretary, were sent off on November 18.    A number of reports, officials disclosed, have observed that the main problem is not the lack of cash in the system but shortage of lower denomination notes. Many have suggested to immediately rush small denomination currency notes to rural areas, relax norms at district cooperative banks and aggressively pursue the public campaign to go cashless. ET has accessed key findings of some of the states:  TELANGANA  The report records that the state's rural economy has been badly hit with ""extensive loss of livelihood"". Based on local Nabard inputs, the team has pointed out that agricultural produce is selling at lower cost in the absence of cash and wealthier farmers are not bringing produce to the market at all.    While weather conditions are favourable for sowing, the report has pointed out that no one has ""yet moved for Rabi crop operations"".    While business establishments in rural areas are open, their operations are down. The report has forecast further losses in the coming months. The team found sharp decline in business of small traders and vendors though they remain functional. The local powerloom industry has also taken a major hit. The second and third tier workers of this economy largely function on cash and have been worst hit.    The overall state finances have seen a drastic fall. The excise revenue, stamp duty, commercial taxes, transport sector revenue have all registered a decline hitting the state by Rs 3,000 crore.    The report states that there is a ""scarcity psychosis"" among people leading to hoarding of Rs 100 notes, which is having an adverse impact on liquidity. On the plus side, banks in the state have conveyed that their NPAs have come down by almost 30% and many gold loans are getting repaid.    They have also recorded a marked increase in deposits in Jan Dhan accounts. However, credit offtake from banks has seen a dramatic decrease despite the Rabi season.    The team has recommended that instead of printing `2,000 notes, currency notes of `500 and `100 should be quickly printed and disbursed to increase liquidity. For farmers, the report suggests old currency must be permitted for use without limit to buy fertilisers, seeds and agricultural inputs.    The team wants a 'cash as a last resort' campaign be started.  KARNATAKA  Here, the general response has been better but the team found panic withdrawal of currency notes from the market. ET has gathered that the report highlights massive short supply of new currency notes. If not made good by month-end, the team feels difficulties may compound, particularly among the salaried class.    Again, the observations is that nonfunctioning of cooperative banks could hit farmers adversely. The report has suggested these entities be treated at par with regular banks to ease the pressure in the rural areas.    It has suggested first priority must be given to rural areas for cash flow facilitation. On the positive side, the report has indicated that the urban areas are better off as the ATM-topopulation coverage is quite good in most cities. Daily wagers in cities, however, have been badly hit.  TAMIL NADU  While highlighting some of the common problems, the team here also has asked to bring in lower denomination notes immediately for an early resolution.    Re-operationalisation of cooperative banks is another suggestion. The report has noted that there is distress on the ground but the government still has a time window to address this problem.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Sowing-season-hit-by-demonetisation-Central-team-red-flag-loss-of-rural-jobs/articleshow/55700378.cms,
2016-12-01 03:56:00,Demonetisation: Opposition may agree to a debate if there is a vote,"NEW DELHI: With 15 days to go for the winter session to close and with the logjam over demonetisation persisting, the opposition parties seem to have decided that they can agree to a discussion other than an adjournment motion as long as there is a division.    The 15 opposition parties will continue to demand PM Modi's intervention in Rajya Sabha even as they decided that they can consider not insisting on an adjournment motion where the government can be censured if a motion under Rule 184 can be taken up. The opposition parties will also decide on a date before the close of the winter session to hold a second march to Rashtrapati Bhavan, to highlight the issue that they have been jointly raising against the government.    The session has almost been a washout so far as both Houses have been witnessing adjournments on a daily basis. Knowing fully well that the government which is in a clear majority in Lok Sabha can easily defeat the combined opposition, the strategy is to put on record that the entire House is not with the government on the way the implementation of the demonetisation is taking place.    The opposition has also decided to make an issue of the way the government passed the taxation amendment bill in Lok Sabha amid an uproar without holding any discussion on the significant legislation. For this purpose, the opposition will submit a memorandum to President Pranab Mukherjee to register its protest to the highest office in the country, though the President does not have much say that could come in the way of the bill becoming operational.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Opposition-may-agree-to-a-debate-if-there-is-a-vote/articleshow/55715696.cms,

According to records of Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, 18.65 metric tonne (MT) gold was imported to Gujarat in November. The imports, which were at a 20-month high, rose by 191% as compared to 6.39 MT in November 2015. In fact, gold imports have doubled as compared to October 2016, which was at 9.2 MT. ""A majority of the imports took place two weeks after the demonetization move by the Union government,"" confirmed Samir Mankad, executive director, GSEC Ltd.    The frenzy to buy gold occurred after demonetization. Piyush Bhansali, president, Choksi Mahajan, said, ""Investments in gold have gone up following demonetization. While there was some speculative investments by small traders, retailers have also invested in gold in a bid to replenish stocks.""    Shanti Patel, president, Gems & Jewellery Trade Council, said, ""Since the trading was good just ahead of Diwali, most jewellers had limited stocks. Soon after demonetization, there was a sudden spurt in gold demand, which exhausted their stocks forcing them to import more gold.""    ""In the last one week, our sales were significantly good. This is mainly because prices went down and people had money in their bank accounts. Moreover, most jewellers have begun accepting payments online and via cheque thus aiding customers in their purchases,"" said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.

Though courts have banned the sport, the annual cock fights continue to be a big betting industry. Cock fighting in coastal Andhra generally crosses Rs 600 crore every year. However, this year the betting amount may not cross Rs 200 crore, sources said.    Preparations for cock fighting usually start by this time of the year, but there is no activity this time around. There are more than 2,000 big organisers in East and West Godavari districts alone, sources said. Every year, the traditional sport starts around the first week of December, peaks in the month of January before concluding in the week leading to Sankranti.    While the big currencies have been banned, there is a huge dearth of the Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes. Therefore, the betting may be reduced to the availability of the Rs 2000 notes. Though the Rs 500 notes were released a couple of days ago, people have not procured sufficient amount for betting, a punter Nekkanti Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Murthy of Konaseema area in East Godavari said.    In East and West Godavari districts, the betting amount crosses Rs 300 crore every year. Rajahmundry and its surrounding rural areas, mandals in Konaseema in East Godavari, Delta areas like Narsapuram, Undi, Palakollu, Bhimavaram, Kalla, Vendra, and Tadepalligudem, Denduluru, Ganapavaram, Attili and other areas in West Godavari are famous for cock fighting.

2016-12-01 09:31:00,Demonetization effect: HDMC collects Rs 16 crore tax in 20 days,"DHARWAD: Demonetization might have caused inconvenience to many, but it has come as a boon to the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) which has collected tax to the tune of Rs 16 crore between November 8 and 30.    Replying to a question raised by corporator Yasin Haveripeth during the general body meeting of the HDMC in Dharwad on Wednesday, HDMC commissioner Siddalingayya Hiremath informed the House that the tax collection before demonetization was 40% of the target.    After demonetization when tax payment was allowed in the scrapped notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, there has been a steep hike in tax collection and the HDMC has turned out to be a topper among the civic bodies in the state in this regard.    Hiremath said the HDMC collected property tax to the tune of Rs 8.18 crore, stallage fee of Rs 1.60 crore, property tax through cheque of Rs 70 lakh, water cess of Rs 2.30 crore in Hubballi and Rs 1.40 crore in Dharwad. ""Now, the HDMC has extended the period of paying taxes through the old Rs 500 notes till December 15 and the collection is likely to swell,"" he said.    Nearly 40% of the shopkeepers had not paid their tax and now 150 shopkeepers are visiting the HDMC office to pay their pending taxes in installments. The HDMC had set a target to collect Rs 9 crore stallage fee of which Rs 3 crore has been collected and the remaining is expected to be received in a fortnight, he added. Some shopkeepers, who had maintained huge overdue, were given notices and their shops were locked. Hiremath said that 700 shopkeepers have sublet their shops and notice has been given to them to vacate the shops. ""If they fail to do so, the HDMC will seize the shops,"" the commissioner said.    Road development    Cutting across party affiliations, the corporators lashed out at HDMC officials for failing to fill-up the potholes and not re-carpeting damaged roads. They said that lower cadre officials are not cooperating with their higher-ups. Though the commissioner tried to pacify the members, Congress corporator Ganesh Tagargunti and others continued raising protest. HDMC chief engineer M S Maddi said that tender has been invited to fill-up the potholes.    Hiremath said that the funds have been earmarked for the setting up of solid waste management units in the twin cities and the decision has been taken during the ongoing assembly session in Belagavi.    Interest waived    The GB also decided to waive the interest charged on pending water bills to help the poor.

The inconvenience that people are facing today will pass. It will take its toll on some much more than others, but the act of having to stand in queues, and go from ATM to ATM in the hope of finding a way to access what one thought was one's money, will in all likelihood be a transient one. For a cause like the attempted eradication of black money, some transient inconvenience can be lived with.    Whatever the misgivings about the long-term impact on the economy, no one really knows what is likely to unfold, so we will all have to wait and watch. But what will undoubtedly remain as a legacy of this move is the return of the government in our lives in an annoyingly permanent way . Given that demonetisation is just one of the many things that the Modi government has up its sleeve to tackle the problem of black money, the role of the `authorities' in our lives is bound to go up very substantially.    The default bureaucratic position is that of nagging distrust. Everything that you say (claim), must be supported (verified, validated, endorsed) and be open to scrutiny (randomly, retrospectively). The attempt to seal all leakages and prevent potential misuse of a `facility' creates an intricate web of rules and exemptions that is self-perpetuating. Every blanket rule needs an exemption, and every exemption needs safeguards to prevent misuse, which in turn requires proof, which in turn can be fabricated.    As signs of `misuse' emerge, these exemptions are plugged by an even more complex layer of provisions that are superimposed on to the original framework, and this process continues organically . In a bureaucracy , rules are organisms that build their own rich, elaborate ecosystems that are self-sustaining.    The return of discretiona ry powers married with a really large canvas to play on, is a recipe for disaster. In the absence of meaningful deterrents against corruption within the bureaucracy , demonetisation can potentially end up unwittingly being a significant sponsor of corruption and ironically , of black money .    Money is a powerful force, almost ecological in its sweep that circulates organically and electrifies virtually all parts of our life. When this `natural' force is artificially stopped, and an attempt is made to regulate this circulation, one is essentially taking up the responsibility of substituting in its entirety a complex mechanism of an ecological nature with one that requires constant human intervention and adjustment. The government is trying to play God, and clearly this is a taxing job, no pun intended. It is no surprise that every day brings in a change; it is not only because of poor planning, but also because planning for such a complex project is virtually impossible.    Perhaps the government needs to take a big picture view of what it is attempting rather than trying to plug every leak and ensure that no misuse takes place.    To go through pain for a period in order to emerge cleaner and stronger is an idea that we should be able to live with. As long as what gets created in order to make this happen does not become a permanent liability. The danger of institutionalising distrust of all in order to punish a few is a real one. It would be a shame if the lasting legacy of big, bold reform were to be small, pervasive and very stifling petty regulation.    santosh365@gmail.com",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Demonetisation-marks-return-of-petty-regulation/articleshow/55717228.cms,kolkata
2016-12-01 08:47:00,'Demonetisation will create room for fiscal stimulus',"MUMBAI: The withdrawal of high denomination currency notes would provide the headroom to provide a policy stimulus to the Indian economy in the next budget. The lower inflation following monetary contraction would pave the way for a rate cut while the additional revenue to the government would create headroom for a large investment stimulus according to Pranjul Bhandari, chief economist, HSBC India.    ""A back of the envelope caluclation indicates that the gains to the fisc would be around Rs 1.3 lakh crore. Half of this could be from additional tax on undeclared income and half from currency in circulation that does not return,"" Bhandari told TOI.    According to Bhandari the sharp contraction in money supply would result in GDP falling by 70 basis points to 100 basis points over a year with the maximum impact in the immediate two quarters. But as currency printing picks up demand would normalise. ""Lower growth for a few quarters means that the output gap will take longer to close, and inflation will be lower, making us confident on our 25bp rate cut call for December 7th,"" said Bhandari.    ""The producer price index, which will be available in December, will give some indication of the impact of demonetistion ,"" she said.    According to Bhandari there is uncertainty on the extent of the fiscal bounty the government will receive as a result of the demonetsiastion. ""There is talk of a large one-time fiscal bounty for the government. However, neither its timing nor its quantum can be taken for granted. As long as the RBI is open to exchanging old notes, it cannot extinguish the liability and transfer funds to the government. Given the legal status of currency notes, it comes as no surprise that so far, the RBI has not officially signed up for an end date for the scheme,"" she said in a report.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-will-create-room-for-fiscal-stimulus/articleshow/55717855.cms,
2016-12-02 13:04:00,Demonetisation impacts India’s border trade with Bhutan,"NEW DELHI: The November 8 demonitisation initiative has adversely impacted India's border trade with Bhutan, Delhi's closest neighbour in South Asia.    Farmers and exporters in Bhutan's Phuentsholing town bordering India has been hit following the currency ban. The move has led to cardamom and potato sales from Bhutan to India dropping drastically as Indian traders have been struggling to arrange cash for making payments, informed persons familiar with the developments. Indian currency is used as legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan. Phuentsholing is the main land border entry point between India and Bhutan.    Sufficient cash is not available for the export-oriented businesses in Phuentsholing market, according to the persons familiar with Indo-Bhutan border trade. Bhutanese traders ruethey get to withdraw only Rs 2,500 from ATMs in a day which is not enough. Most of the transactions are cash based.    The price of cardamom mid-November hit a record low of 700 Ngultrum per kg, which was between 800 and 900 Ngultrum a week ago. Ngultrum is the currency of Bhutan. One Bhutanese Ngultrum equals One Indian Rupee.    Indian traders have informed their Bhutanese counterparts they would be able to import agro-products only after three months. Some Bhutanese traders have not been able to export any cardamom since November 8. Cardamom export has drastically gone down in Silliguri, which is a major market for Bhutan. If the trend continues the cardamom price will decline further and there is risk that exports from Bhutan will get further affected, according to informed sources.    Similarly potato exports from Bhutan to India have also slowed down. Some Indian exporters also paid their Bhutanese counterparts in old currencies. India is Bhutan's largest trading partner. A free trade regime exists between India and Bhutan. Major items of exports from Bhutan to India are electricity, ferro-alloys, carbides, bar and rods, cement, copper wire, semi finished products of iron and non-alloy steel, Dolomite, gypsum, agri products such as oranges, cardamom and potatoes.    Meanwhile, Bhutan's mineral exports to Bangladesh has also been affected. While Letter of Credits are being used for payments, transportation has been proving a challenge.    Trucks from Phuentsholing and Samdrupjongkhar, on the border with Assam, take minerals until Burimari, border area between India and Bangladesh. Indian currency is required for logisticssupport in this trade which is currently not available in the market.    Bhutan has been taking up the issue of currency ban with India ever since the PM's announcement on demonitisation as the Himalayan State is also being faced with the crisis of cash crunch. Nepal and Bhutan, two major recipients of Indian financial aid, have taken up with New Delhi the issue of demonetisation of high-value currency bills and the impact it could have on financial assistance to them. India has earmarked Rs5,490 crore for Bhutan and Rs300 crore for Nepal in this year's budget.    The Bhutanese Central Bank has informed all banks in the country to freeze, until further notice, withdrawals of Ngultrums in exchange for demonetised INR notes of 500 and 1,000 denomination by Bhutanese individuals and companies.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-impacts-Indias-border-trade-with-Bhutan/articleshow/55718532.cms,
2016-12-01 10:13:00,Demonetisation fallout: Traders hit as dry fish left to rot,"BHUBANESWAR: Enter the Phiringia weekly market, the first thing you will notice is heaps of dry fish with woman traders sitting beside. The dry fish, out of which several local delicacies are made, were in great demand before the demonetisation. Now, the fish stock is on the verge of rotting.    Around 30 businesswomen come to the market with the stock every Tuesday from Baliguda in Kandhamal district. They procure the dry fish in bulk from wholesalers in Berhampur of Ganjam district.    ""Each of us had lifted fish stock worth Rs 20,000 in the first week of November. We didn't know that the stock will remain unsold?"" said Dalimba Behera.    She said suddenly the notes were banned dealing a body blow to their business. ""We don't know for whose benefit the notes were banned but we are at the receiving end. I think it will take a long time before things normalize,"" she added.    The fish traders keep eight varieties of fish, which are prepared by drying and sprinkling salt. Although dry fish's shelflife is around two weeks after preparation, they had procured them a month ago. Especially in winter the sale peaks.    Sarita Sahoo, another woman, said the fish have started smelling bad and they have no storage facility in their village. ""If a man comes with Rs 2,000 (which is my one-day sale) note and buy Rs 200 worth of fish, how can I return the remaining Rs 800?"" she asked adding in Phiringia and Baliguda, the ATMs are yet to dispense new Rs 500 notes.    Sarita said in order to get change currencies they had to wait in long queue. If this situation persists they will have to look for other livelihood options. ""It is better to sell vegetable in small quantity rather than bear losses due to rotten fish,"" she said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Demonetisation-fallout-Traders-hit-as-dry-fish-left-to-rot/articleshow/55718962.cms,bhubaneswar
2016-12-01 09:46:00,"On first payday after demonetisation, banks run out of cash within hours and ATMs dry up","MUMBAI: Banks faced the brunt of public frustration again as customers found themselves standing in long lines to withdraw cash after November salaries were credited to accounts.    As banks ran out of notes, people waited at automated teller machines but struck out there too as supplies to cash dispensers were down to a fifth of required levels, according to bankers, who said a lack of new Rs 500 notes was worsening the situation.    “The situation will not change much from our side even if it is salary day because there is not enough cash in bank branches or ATMs,” said an official at a large private sector bank. “The situation will only improve once Rs 500 notes come into circulation and it will take days before that happens.”    On the first payday after the November 8 demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, banks ran out of cash within hours of opening as multiple reports suggested the government was trying to increase the supply of Rs 500 notes. The Reserve Bank of India has been striving to meet increased demand but bankers said rationing of supplies still seemed to be the order of the day.    “RBI is currently supplying cash based on a variety of calculations including how much a bank branch got the previous day,” said another banker. “That will continue. We will continue to ration cash.”    Supplies to ATMs have been falling short, said several people with knowledge of the matter.    “We are only getting around 20% of the daily cash that is required by us in order to get the entire ATM network of the country up and running in a normal manner,” said one insider.    “Although under supervision from the ATM task force more than 1.5 lakh ATMs have already been tweaked for the new series notes, they are running dry due to lack of adequate supply of cash from the Reserve Bank of India.”    Another of the persons cited above said, “In normal times, during the salary season we used to get around Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 crore from the banks to be distributed across ATMs in the country on a daily basis. Now we are getting around Rs 2,000 crore which is awfully inadequate.”    Before the withdrawal of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, ATMs used to be filled with about Rs 50 lakh of currency. That’s dropped to Rs 5 lakh at a time because of the shortfall in supply.    A former RBI official said the central bank had stepped up printing and distribution of currency.    “Payday worries are overdone,” he said. “The scarcity of currency is also because people are hoarding cash that was earlier easily circulated.” Bankers said this was aggravating matters. “Consumption spending has seen a sharp fall and if money gets stuck with the people and does not come back to the banking system, how will banks recirculate the currency?” said one of them.    The weekly withdrawal limit is Rs 24,000 for savings accounts and Rs 50,000 for current accounts. ATM withdrawals are limited to Rs 2,500 at a time from dispensers recalibrated to take new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. Those that haven’t been reprogrammed will dispense Rs 2,000 at a time.    Private sector banks, who’ve had to impose their own withdrawal limits on top of those set by the government, said they were worse off than state-owned counterparts. “What do you expect? We are running our branches on onesixth capacity,” said one private bank executive. “We don’t have enough cash. We need to cater to all customers who come to us.”    Southern India was also feeling the pinch. “We received Rs 40 crore yesterday and Rs 20 crore today,” said the CEO of a small private sector bank based in the south. “We are getting cash in multiples of Rs 2,000, some Rs 100 and if available, Rs 500. All this cash is being distributed among our branches. We are giving priority to the branches that have a lot of salary accounts because of payday. But we cannot predict how long this cash will last.”  UNPREDICTABLE DEMAND  Bankers said the situation is such that it’s nearly impossible to predict demand or meet it.    “We have done an analysis on how much cash will be required based on the number of companies which distribute their salary through us,” said the retail head of a large private sector bank.    “However, there are many things which are not under our control like if people decide to withdraw their full weekly limit on one day or how much RBI gives us. Then there are other normal cash demands from our current account customers which we cannot ignore. We are hoping we can meet the demand.”    Private sector bankers said the state-owned ones that manage currency chests have an advantage when it comes to supply of notes.    Of the total 4,075 RBI-owned currency chests in India, State Bank of India and its associates manage more than half. Other public sector banks manage 1,173 chests while private ones run 160.    “Money disbursed to PSU (public sector unit) banks is more than us because they also need to meet the post office and rural demand,” said one private sector banker. “PSU banks are synonymous with the government machinery. They can’t be seen running out of cash so quickly, unlike us.”    State-owned bank officials rejected this contention.    “Our currency chests don’t mean it only caters to our demand. Currency chest is the property of the RBI,” said one. “We are getting currency as per our requirement.    The RBI links smaller banks to currency chests of one of the banks as per requirement. Some of the banks are linked to our currency chests while remaining are linked with other chests so it depends upon the linkage.”",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/On-first-payday-after-demonetisation-banks-run-out-of-cash-within-hours-and-ATMs-dry-up/articleshow/55718637.cms,
2016-12-01 09:41:00,Demonetisation: Retailers at popular shopping hubs still accepting old currency,"NEW DELHI/BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Three weeks after Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes ceased to be legal tender, small and medium retailers across popular shopping destinations such as Janpath in New Delhi, Crawford Market in Mumbai, New Market in Kolkata and flea markets of Goa are accepting old notes as they attempt to keep their business afloat, which has got badly impacted by the shortage of new notes.    Small retailers and footpath shops that dot Kolkata’s high street and old shopping hubs like New Market, Gariahat and Vardaan Market stopped accepting old notes for 3-4 days after demonetisation thinking new notes would be made available and business would return to normal.    But that has not happened. The lack of supply of new notes coupled with the desire of consumers to hold on to their small kitty of new notes resulted in their daily sales falling by 60-80%, prompting them to accept old notes once again. These are small shops that have refrained from using credit cards and other digital modes of payment.    Elsewhere in the country, a lampshade seller at Janpath, New Delhi said almost everyone in the busy fashion and accessories market was accepting the old notes, albeit clandestinely.    “Don’t say it aloud that you will pay through old notes....say in a low voice, everyone here accepts,” said a salesman in Janpath while accepting a Rs 1,000 note for purchases on Tuesday evening.    The story is no different at Candolim in Goa, Colaba Causeway in Mumbai, and Church Street in Bengaluru.    “November-January is a peak corporate gifting season and the business that we do in December covers up for the slow months of the year,” said the proprietor of a store in Church Street, who did not wish to be identified. “On an average, nine big companies come to us every year with budgets of around Rs 20-25 lakh. This time, none of them have come.”    He said he was forced to accept old notes as he feared for the survival of his business amid declining sales of up to 90%, coupled with high rentals. “If this situation remains the same for the next three months, I might have to shut shop,” he said adding rentals in the area tops Rs 150 per square feet per month plus Rs 5 per square feet per month for maintenance.    The acceptance of old notes is just not confined to small purchases. High-value items such as carpets and shawls too are being purchased with the discontinued high-denomination currency. These notes are also being put to use in the busy wedding season. Many banquet halls in West Delhi are accepting part payments in old currency notes but are charging 15-20% extra on the previously agreed amount, “We are using the old currency to make payments to our suppliers like caterers, florists, decorators, DJ etc. Everyone knows the situation and are co-operating as much as they can,” said the owner of a banquet hall in Peeragarhi in West Delhi. “Eventually everyone will have to deposit some money in their bank accounts.”    Most of the small retailers and other establishments that are accepting these old notes say they would deposit them into their bank accounts and those of their relatives by the December 30 deadline.    Some would pass the money to agents who are ‘managing’ illegal currencies. But these shopkeepers are aware that they can continue to accept the old notes for another month at the most.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Retailers-at-popular-shopping-hubs-still-accepting-old-currency/articleshow/55718623.cms,
2016-12-03 01:05:00,Industries on demonetisation,"Edited / 420 words (Kanna)    Micro units say production has dipped by up to 50%    Times News Network    Coimbatore: Production in medium and small scale industries in the district has fallen anywhere between 30% and 50% after demonetization, say industrial bodies. They say the cash crunch has made it difficult for them to pay labourers, many of whom failed to turn up for work. They have also not been able to purchase raw materials. Fall in business has impacted the bank balances and their ability to pay interest on loans.    Close to 50 industrial associations, including small and medium industries, across the Western region met at CODISSIA trade fair complex on Friday evening to release a set of eight demands they plan to submit to finance minister Arun Jaitley and the Ministry for Micro, Small and Medium industries.    Industrialists say that despite the centre insisting that companies pay their labourers through bank transfers, the labourers are not willing to accept bank payments. ""The workers insist on cash payments and if they don't get salaries in cash, they do not want to work,"" said president of Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association, V Sundaram. ""If we transfer money into their bank accounts, they insist on waiting in long queues to draw money. All this happens during work hours,"" he said.    Micro units say 90% of them make weekly payments to their labourers, and labourers now want to go to the bank on Monday to withdraw money, missing work. Kovai Power Driven Pumps And Spares Manufacturers Association (KOPMA)president, Maniraj, says ""For people like us, none of the banks allow us to withdraw Rs25,000 a week fully. They tell us to return with Rs10,000 and Rs12,000,"" he said. ""If they do give us cash, they give it in Rs2000 notes. Our workers want to be paid in Rs100 notes. We cannot afford to lose them,"" he said.    Maniraj say pumpset orders have fallen by 60%. This has affected the businesses of those who manufacture pumpset accessories. ""We have to continue paying interest on loans. If we don't pay dues for three months, we will be black marked as a non-performing asset,"" said Coimbatore Tirupur district Micro and Cottage Entrepreneur Association president, K Ravikumar.    There are at least 1 lakh small scale units between Coimbatore and Erode, employing another 7 lakh people. Their demands include ensuring banks in Coimbatore have sufficient cash in small denominations to tide over the crisis. They also want the government to either remove or increase withdrawal limits of Rs25,000. They also demand extension of time period for repayment of loans and extension of NPA norms from 90 days to one year.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/Industries-on-demonetisation/articleshow/55760973.cms,coimbatore
2017-01-29 07:49:00,Box office grapples with demonetisation,"It has been nearly a month since India slipped into demonetisation mode. Businesses, across, have been affected without an exception. Even though the box office has just begun to recover, we know it will be a slow ride down that road. Most November releases have fared below expectations, and footfalls, over all, have seen a considerable dip. Naturally, single screens have felt the pinch harder. Fearing low collections, producers are now reassessing the release dates of their films which they'd blocked months in advance.    'Rock On 2', which hit the screens on November 11, was the first big Hindi film to release immediately after the demonetisation drive. Despite a buy-one-get-one-free offer on tickets, the musical registered below par numbers. The animation flick, 'Chaar Sahibzaade: Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur', which released the same day, registered comparatively decent collections. That week's third release, 'Dongri Ka Raja', wasn't even in the running. 'Force 2' and 'Tum Bin 2' came a week later. While the former saw decent numbers during the opening weekend, the latter didn't make the grade.    Fortunately, 'Dear Zindagi' helped the business sense some relief from frightening box-office numbers. The Alia Bhatt-Shah Rukh Khan-starrer has brought in a ray of hope. All eyes are now set on 'Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh' that opens today.    'There's a 50 per cent dip in collections in most territories as compared to what we see usually at this time of the year. A lot of cinemas are running shows on minimum capacity, which adds to their expense. When people can't withdraw even modest sums, how will they spend on movie outings? Luxuries come after necessities, right?' rues producer Mukesh Bhatt, head of the Film and Television Producers Guild of India (FTPGI). He adds, 'What did the government plan for single screens and smaller multiplex chains that can't survive even when the times aren't as bad? An average weekend collection of `40 crore has slipped by 50 per cent. Even Aamir Khan's upcoming release could take a hit, the difference might be felt.'    Clearly, not all movie patrons rush to cinemas after a long day at the bank queues. The demonetisation drive, which initially didn't seem like it would affect Bollywood's basic modalities, seems to be taking a toll. Producers are now watching out for the box-office collections of December's two big-ticket movies, because the performances of these films would pave the way for releases slated from January 2017. Mumbai-based distributor Rajesh Thadani says, 'If Aamir's Christmas release doesn't perform well, most producers will be forced to reassess their dates. Not that they aren't doing it right now. For example, 'Wajah Tum Ho' was pushed ahead. The impact of demonetisation is slowly wearing out, but it will take a while for the business to stabilise and recover.'    Sanjay Ghai, a Delhi-based distributor and cinema chain owner, points out, 'Postponing dates will add to promotional costs and affect the producer's math. Recovery from films will slow down because a transformation like this takes long to settle in. In most centres, across the last month, weekdays have been weaker than weekends.'  Manoj Desai, the owner of single-screen theatres in Mumbai, has another issue at hand. 'We don't get subsidies. While the tickets cost around Rs 100 each, people have been coming to us with Rs 2000 notes. Where will we find so much change to return? Even with low prices, we're finding it difficult to sustain,' he sighs. However, the picture is not entirely bleak. Hollywood film 'Doctor Strange' registered good numbers, building on its young, multiplex-going target audience, familiar with the online ticketing infrastructure.    Indore-based distributor Aditya Chowksey says, 'Some Hindi releases had rank bad content. Even a regional film like 'Ventilator' (which released on November 4) did far better business than the Bollywood fare. 'Doctor Strange' held its own; 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' continued its run, too. Good content has had takers even in bad times. Yes, the figures have seen an overall slump, but that's not entirely due to demonetisation.'  Kamal Gianchandani of a national multiplex chain says that he was surprised to find that his revenue hadn't been impacted as badly as he feared. 'The use of plastic money has doubled up at chains like ours. People don't use cash even at food counters and parking lots. We were lesser affected because our patrons used digital wallets. But to say that a film tanked because of the economic drive alone is a bit much. If that was the case, international and regional films wouldn't have done well, right? It's time to look within and figure out why and where we are losing money,' he sums up.",entertainment,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Box-office-grapples-with-demonetisation/articleshow/55725486.cms,

Discontinuance of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes he said is designed to target illicit cash proceeds from corruption and tax dodging.

2016-12-02 12:34:00,Manufacturing sees slowest growth since July as demonetisation weighs,"NEW DELHI: The first evidence of the impact of demonetisation emerged on Thursday as manufacturing activity eased in November from October's 22-month high with new orders seeing the weakest expansion since July.    The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) slowed to 52.3 in November from October's 54.4. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction. ""PMI data for November showed that the sudden withdrawal of high-value banknotes in India caused problems for manufacturers, as cash shortage hampered growth of new work, buying activity and production,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit.    ""However, whereas some may have anticipated an outright downturn, the sector held its ground and remained in expansion mode. Although many companies which were surveyed commented that further disruption is expected in the near-term, the demonetisation of the rupee is anticipated to ignite growth in the long-run as unregulated companies leave the market,"" De Lima said.    Several economists have cut their GDP growth forecasts to below 7% for India in the current fiscal against the backdrop of the note ban which was announced on November 8. The government expects some disruption in the next two quarters but is confident of a growth rebound after that. Latest data showed the economy grew by 7.3% in the July-September quarter, helping India retain the tag of the fastest growing major economy in the world but demonetisation is expected to cut into growth in the months ahead.    The survey showed that one factor contributing to the downward movement in PMI was a softer expansion in new business inflows. Order books rose at a moderate pace. Panellists reported higher demand from domestic as well as external clients, but indicated that growth was hampered by the money crisis. The upturn in new export orders also lost some momentum in November.    Manufacturing production growth slowed amid reports of cash shortages. Softer increases in output were noted in each of the three monitored sectors, with consumer goods producers recording a sharp slowdown in growth, the survey showed. Although firms continued to step up their quantities of purchases, the rate of expansion eased from October's 14-month high.    Money issue was the main reason listed by respondents for softer growth in input buying. By sector, the weakest performer was consumer goods.

2016-12-02 03:04:00,Poor happy in belief demonetisation hitting rich harder than it hit them,"Nagpur: Despite hardships, the marginalized class seems to find demonetization to be a great leveller. The idea that it has hit the rich hard, has left many in the segment convinced that the policy will ultimately turn their fortunes in long run. If not so, at least bring the upper class down.    TOI did a quick survey, among workers, street vendors, petty businessmen, and small contractors across the city, which revealed that this class supported demonetisation no matter the troubles they faced. The day to day struggle on account of cash crunch was not denied, but a vast majority of those TOI talked to saw light at end of the tunnel. Their arguments may have lacked much sense of economics, even as each one felt that the money now pouring into the banks will finally reach the poor.    A few also complained that they were facing problems in depositing their life long savings in banks. Though earned out of hard labour they preffered to keep it at home. Now as the amount is huge they may not be able to explain the source.    For many demonetisation meant social justice as they hoped that if the rich are made poor by snatching away their wealth, things will get cheaper. A blow to rich also seemed to pacify their pent-up anger against the well-heeled class.    ""Now even the rich will be at par with those like me,"" said Shyam Sundar Gaur who moves around the town in a bicycle selling paper fans for Rs10 each. Gaur's smile said it all. ""The rich always looked down upon us, now they have been robbed of their vanity, I wonder if any of them can do hard work like me now,"" he said.    Sandip Sahoo who runs a food stall near Futala Lake said, his business was down by nearly half. But he believed finally when there are enough new notes in the market there will be money for all, especially the poor.    Javed Raza a fruit vendor at Santra Market, said ""I do not entirely support the BJP. Especially the decision on beef ban has left many miffed. But I would back Narendra Modi on demonetisation. No matter if it has halved my business but, I am happy that black money is being flushed out.""    ""The rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer. The gap will be bridged now. The common man is certainly facing hardships but that will be temporary."" said Ashraf Ali a roadside shoe vendor at Santra Market.    For many it was because of their meagre income that they did not have much to loose. So demonetisation had hardly affected them.    ""With a salary of Rs8,000 a month, I hardly have anything in the bank. I hope that life will become better for the poor after this,"" said Sachin Mahindarkar a security guard at LIC's office at Kingsway.    Jagdish Chaudhary a mechanic said he had saved a substantial amount running into lakhs which could not be deposited in the bank as he did not have the right documents to open an account. Now he is finding it difficult to explain the source.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Poor-happy-in-belief-demonetisation-hitting-rich-harder-than-it-hit-them/articleshow/55735409.cms,nagpur
2016-12-02 04:00:00,Mfg sees slowest growth since July as demonetisation weighs,"New Delhi: The first evidence of the impact of demonetisation emerged on Thursday as manufacturing activity eased in November from October's 22-month high with new orders seeing the weakest expansion since July.    The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) slowed to 52.3 in November from October's 54.4. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction.    ""PMI data for November showed that the sudden withdrawal of high-value banknotes in India caused problems for manufacturers, as cash shortage hampered growth of new work, buying activity and production,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit.    ""However, whereas some may have anticipated an outright downturn, the sector held its ground and remained in expansion mode. Although many companies which were surveyed commented that further disruption is expected in the near-term, the demonetisation of the rupee is anticipated to ignite growth in the long-run as unregulated companies leave the market,"" De Lima said.    Several economists have cut their GDP growth forecasts to below 7% for India in the current fiscal against the backdrop of the note ban which was announced on November 8.    The government expects some disruption in the next two quarters but is confident of a growth rebound after that. Latest data showed the economy grew by 7.3% in the July-September quarter, helping India retain the tag of the fastest growing major economy in the world but demonetisation is expected to cut into growth in the months ahead.    The survey showed that one factor contributing to the downward movement in PMI was a softer expansion in new business inflows. Order books rose at a moderate pace. Panellists reported higher demand from domestic as well as external clients, but indicated that growth was hampered by the money crisis. The upturn in new export orders also lost some momentum in November.    Manufacturing production growth slowed amid reports of cash shortages. Softer increases in output were noted in each of the three monitored sectors, with consumer goods producers recording a sharp slowdown in growth, the survey showed.    Although firms continued to step up their quantities of purchases, the rate of expansion eased from October's 14-month high. Money issue was the main reason listed by respondents for softer growth in input buying. By sector, the weakest performer was consumer goods. Manufacturing employment was broadly unchanged during November as has been observed for around two-and-a-half years .",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Mfg-sees-slowest-growth-since-July-as-demonetisation-weighs/articleshow/55735924.cms,
2016-12-02 12:24:00,Govt firm on not going for vote in Parliament on demonetisation,"NEW DELHI: The government is clear that it is not ready to discuss demonetisation in Lok Sabha under a voting clause as such a motion will involve a likely criticism of the decision and can favour Speaker Sumitra Mahajan's suggestion that a notice submitted by BJD under Rule 193 be taken up for debate.    A government source said the motion under a voting rule sought by opposition parties like Congress and Trinamool would require a ""substantive motion"" that requires a view on demonetisation. ""As most parties, barring a few, do not feel the decision is in itself wrong, such a motion cannot be considered at all,"" said the source.    Instead, the Speaker's view, expressed at a meeting with party leaders on Thursday, was that if there is no agreement between the government and the opposition, a notice submitted by BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab can be taken up. In selecting notices to be taken up, the Speaker can decide to admit a notice under Rule 193 — not necessarily the BJD submission — but the situation in the House will also need to be taken into consideration.    Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar told TOI, ""By stalling a debate on grounds such as which rule to debate under, the opposition is preventing a discussion on demonetisation. If they want to highlight hardships faced by the people, a discussion can only help improve matters when the PM and finance minister Arun Jaitley respond.""    During Thursday's discussions, the Trinamool's insistence on a ""rollback"" of demonetisation put it at odds with other parties like Congress as this demand is not likely to be accommodated by a motion under Rule 193. Trinamool leaders indicated readiness for a discussion but more bargaining on the ""voting"" clause is in the offing, ensuring that the deadlock in Parliament continues.    The government has argued that if most parties agree that action against black money is laudable but implementation could be better, there is no cause for a division. Though Congress and Left parties have not associated with Trinamool's public protests, a convergence on attacking the government has seen them act in unison with the Bengal outfit's pitch for a vote proving difficult to negotiate.    The government on Thursday responded to the opposition demand that PM Narendra Modi be present in the House by ensuring his presence in the afternoon. ""The opposition said PM's presence during his morning question hour is no concession and so sought his presence later even though we did not think there would be a breakthrough,"" said a minister.    Government managers have said the opposition demand in Rajya Sabha that the PM ""apologise"" for his remarks that the real reason for criticism of demonetisation was unhappiness over no one being given notice to prepare was not reasonable. ""There is nothing to suggest that he was referring to the opposition,"" said the source.

2016-12-02 07:38:00,Daring Demonetisation is now an economic worry: VCCIs,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to encourage consumer spending through carefully worded messages to the common man so that economic activity is once again revived in small and medium business.    In a letter addressed to the PM on Thursday, VCCI said, ""The initial euphoria and high praise for the daring demonetisation move is slowly fading into economic worry due to the lack of currency as well as slowdown in trade and commerce. Obviously, the Government of India was ill prepared as well as ill equipped to meet the challenges of demonetisation given the scope and scale of the cash economy in India.""    Furthermore, VCCI said, ""We are now nearly a month into this exercise and still the economy is showing no signs of coming out of its sluggish state. From the fastest growing economy, backed by normal monsoons and pay commission hikes, it has slowed down considerably. Money is like blood! It needs to keep moving around to keep the economy moving. As the nation limps through the demonetisation, we see 'ghost' shops and establishments. The 'velocity' of money is missing. Money passing from hand to hand at speed is required for more people to have the benefit and what it purchased for them. Be it currency or electronic, this velocity is badly missing and the fate of many communities that depended on it are in jeopardy. Consumer spending is held back both due to lack of currency as well as lack of sentiment.""    Expressing the need to encourage consumer spending, VCCI said, ""We need to quickly bring back the lost trust caused by confusion and increase consumer spending through carefully worded messages to the common man so that economic activity is once again revived in our small and medium businesses. Else there will be a colossal loss to national wealth in the coming months.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Daring-Demonetisation-is-now-an-economic-worry-VCCIs/articleshow/55735278.cms,visakhapatnam
2016-12-02 10:03:00,"Demonetisation: How TCS, which counts RBI & other banks as clients, changed back-end systems overnight","BENGALURU: Late on the evening of November 8, 10 executives at Tata Consultancy Services got on a conference call to discuss how to ensure that their banking customers will be able to comply with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement.  TCS, which counts RBI, the State Bank of India and a host of financial institutions as its customers, had to work on a war footing to try and smooth the inevitable bumps that could occur when over 80% of a country’s currency loses its validity almost overnight.    “The first thing we did on the conference call was to make a list of the top-five priorities that had to go into work right away. Then we had to put some work we were doing with the banks on hold, to make everyone focus on changing the back-end systems to put in things like withdrawal limits,” Ravi Viswanathan, president of TCS’ Growth Markets business, told ET.    Viswanathan said that changes like putting in withdrawal limits were done in such a way that they could be modified with minimal additional effort going forward. But new policy changes required additional effort to alter the banking systems.    “Making it configurable has helped because the withdrawal amounts have changed a few times over the past few weeks. But when the marriage withdrawal limit was announced, that required more effort because that change was not configurable,” Viswanathan said.    The company also had to reconfigure the machines carried by banking correspondents, who work in farflung villages unserved by permanent bank branches. The company is also working with some clients on ‘queuebusting’ solutions to ease the long waits to withdraw money for customers. TCS has had to bring in 100 additional employees into its banking projects to institute the changes; it also refocused existing banking employees who were working on less urgent projects. Viswanathan said the company had clocked 1,000 person days of work in just the first 10-15 days since demonetisation was announced. TCS is not alone in needing extra help to manage demonetisation. Bank employees have worked late nights and weekends and, in some cases, retired workers have been brought back to manage the rush of work.    To make it easier for bank heads to understand how much money was flowing into their accounts and how much was leaving, TCS created a mobile app that pulled in the data from the core-banking systems.    “Now they can see on an hourly, daily basis exactly what is happening with the money in their system. We could have done physical reports, but we thought we should make this digital,” Viswanathan said. The digital platform took about a week to create, post demonetisation.    Experts on IT systems at banks say that managing the back end at banks is crucial in the current situation.    “No bank could have been prepared for this. And, unlike foreign banks, banks in India are yet to adopt a high level of automation. Some of the smaller banks do not have very sophisticated online banking systems. Even depositing notes in ATMs is a concern because the machines are old and there are concerns about security,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of IT consultancy Greyhound Research.    TCS, Bengaluru-based rival Infosys and Oracle Financial Services Software run the core-banking systems for a large number of Indian lenders. Viswanathan added that TCS had the bandwidth to handle the changes that would be needed and that future steps would involve boosting the banks’ digital capabilities.    “Most of the banks have already started building their digital systems with mobile wallets and so on. Going forward, the work will be to add functionality and create infrastructure for the higher level of utilisation that will follow,” he added.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-How-TCS-which-counts-RBI-other-banks-as-clients-changed-back-end-systems-overnight/articleshow/55742484.cms,
2016-12-02 07:47:00,Demonetisation is both a bane and boon for transport vehicle owners,"VISAKHAPATNAM: There is a mixed response to demonetisation among owners and drivers of heavy transport vehicles like lorries, trucks, trolleys in the port city.    While owners are finding it difficult to arrange cash for plying the vehicles due to restrictions on currency transactions, drivers are having a hassle free journey on the national and state highways.    M Janakiram Reddy, chairman of Motor Transport JAC for north coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts, said the driver of the vehicles no longer faced harrassment from officials belonging to the Road Transport Authority (RTA), commercial tax, agriculture and marketing, and civil supplies departments.    Ichchapuram check post on the Andhra-Odisha Border on NH-16 in Srikakulam district is the third busiest checkpost in the country as it has no alternative route, Reddy said, adding that the corrupt practices of the officials was also the highest at the check-post.    ""No vehicle can pass the checkpost without paying officials despite having all valid documents,"" Reddy said. This has now drastically reduced due to the demonetisation.    ""Nearly Rs 20,000 is required as toll plaza charges and Rs 10,000 in cash is taken as bribe to let a vehicle pass. But now, due to the toll plaza exemptions and demonetisation of the two high value currencies, vehicle operators have been spared this harassment,"" Janakiram Reddy said, adding that they would appeal to the Union ministry to continue the exemption of the toll plaza charges for the entire month of December. However, as of now, toll is slated to be collected from the midnight of December 2.    ""As a permanent measure, we will also ask the Union ministry to collect toll plaza charges at a single time once a year instead of daily at every toll plaza. It will save time for both the government, service provider and transport operators like us,"" Reddy said.    On the other hand, Rokkam Jagadeesh, who runs trucks to transport goods between industries and Visakhapatnam port, said demonetisation had a negative impact on truck operators like him. Jagadeesh said a driver must keep Rs 20,000 in cash with him in order to meet running expenditures including fuel cost, maintenance cost and food. Due to the restrictions on cash withdrawal limit at banks, the truck operators are facing problems.    He said nearly 5,000 transport vehicles including lorries, trucks, trolleys and oil tanks operate daily from the city to various parts of north and south India on National Highway 16. Due to demonetisation, nearly 2,000 vehicles have been kept aside. This situation will improve after the implementation of cashless transactions at the toll plazas and petrol bunks, he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Demonetisation-is-both-a-bane-and-boon-for-transport-vehicle-owners/articleshow/55735169.cms,visakhapatnam
2016-12-02 10:05:00,Chaos in NMC house over ‘demonetisation deaths’,"NAGPUR: The BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Thursday refused to adopt a proposal moved by leader of opposition Vikas Thakre ""to pray for peace for the people who have died in queues outside banks and ATMs after demonetisation"". Later, Thakre was joined by Nationalist Congress Party and Bahujan Samajwadi Party corporators in shouting slogans and protesting in the well of the house.    It led to chaos in the general body meeting. In the commotion, Datke passed all 15 resolutions, including the one of the Nag River front development and environment status report of 2014-2015.    The meeting commenced with mayor Pravin Datke asking municipal secretary Harish Dubey to begin with the proposal to mourn the death of people and offer condolences to jawans martyred in the militant attacks in Kashmir, and observe a two-minute silence. Though Thakre claimed to have submitted a written proposal to Dubey to also mourn the death of people in queues outside banks and ATMS, the ruling party had ignored it.    Thakre alleged that there have been over 70 deaths related to demonetisation since November 9. Usually, NMC pays tribute to even distant relatives of any corporator, but on Thursday it refused to mourn the deaths of all those people who have died due to demonetisation, he claimed.    The mayor, however, refused to entertain Thakre's demand and clarified that he had received no such proposal. He instead told Thakre that condolences will be offered in the next general body meeting or special meeting if he gives the names of those who had died.    This led to an uproar from opposition corporators, including Congress, BSP and NCP. Amid the chaos, on the request of Leader of Ruling Party Dayashankar Tiwari, the mayor started reading the issues on the agenda one by one. The members of the ruling party gave approval to these issues one by one based on majority, thus passing all proposals.    Later, speaking to media persons, Thakre alleged that the ruling party had no sympathy for those who died due to demonetisation across the country. He also claimed that both ruling party and civic administration did nothing for the city. Before the house proceedings commenced, Thakre said a delegation of Congress corporators had met municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar and sought action taken reports on issues raised by them.    According to Thakre, in the last five years, the Congress party has exposed scams related to Starbus, Orange City Water, cable duct, jetpatcher and shoddy road works by private firms. ""When we raised these issues, the mayor directed the administration in the house to take action. But till date nothing has been done,"" he said.    Thakre said the issue was raised by not only Congress corporators but also ruling party corporators, with demand for action against contractors and NMC engineers. ""The mayor formed a committee and assured to black list such contractors, but nothing was done for it.This shows the casual approach of both ruling party and civic administration,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Chaos-in-NMC-house-over-demonetisation-deaths/articleshow/55735685.cms,nagpur
2017-01-29 07:53:00,"Sujoy Ghosh: If anything goes wrong with 'Kahaani 2', it will be purely my fault. Nothing to do with demonetisation","He has worked for the big screen and also contributed to the digital platform. Director Sujoy Ghosh feels that the digital platform is slowly taking over cinema and is the future. After 'Ahalya', many short films including 'Kriti', 'Ouch' and 'Raakh' released on digital platforms and were also lauded for their crisp and fascinating content.  Sujoy Ghosh: I don’t think Jantar Mantar or Qutub Minar make Delhi. The people of Delhi make DelhiSujoy Ghosh says that he has never had a chance to stay in Delhi and get to know its people.  Asked if he feels the digital platform is slowly taking over cinema, Ghosh told: ""Absolutely, it has to. That is progress and that is the future. I don't know if it will happen in my lifetime or not, but definitely, it is the future.""    ""The way the digital world is spreading and the way you are accessible and you can access, is only matter of time...When I can beam my movies straight to you at your door step, it is a one to one relationship,"" added the director, whose film 'Kahaani 2', a thriller, hit the screens on Friday.    Asked if he has seen an evolution in the thriller genre, he said: ""It is evolving...Any film that is engaging, is a thriller for me. Even when I am watching a hardcore romantic film that is also a thriller for me, as long as I invest in the characters and know more about the film. It is a thriller for me.""    He says right now a 'standard definition' to a thriller is given. ""There in one murder, one investigation...I don't think we need all that. They might help, but there are other ways to represent a thriller.""    This will be the second time Ghosh will be seen working with actress Vidya Balan. Ghosh says the actress is willing to give him ""company in the madness"".    ""The kind of scripts I write are not necessarily very palatable, easy scripts. My scripts are normally very demanding, my style of working is very demanding. So, I think Vidya is the only one who gives me company on these journeys,"" he said.    The director adds that he also finds it comfortable working with her. Is Vidya a director's actress? ""She is a director's actress, but best is not to direct her. That would be my advise to any director, who works with Vidya,"" he said about the actress, who also featured in his 2012 directorial 'Kahaani'. Does he fear that demonetisation may affect the box office collection of 'Kahaani 2'?    ""I saw 'Dear Zindagi' doing really good. I think it's a question of priority if people want to spend...If anything goes wrong with the film, it will be purely my fault. Nothing to do with demonetisation, nothing to do with anything. It will be because we made a bad film,"" Ghosh added.

2016-12-02 12:26:00,Andhra Pradesh Ministers and Officials Cries Foul over Demonetisation,"AMARAVATI: Expressing serious anguish about the impact of demonetisation, finance department officials briefed the state cabinet that the exchequer had already lost Rs.800 core of revenue in the last three weeks. The senior officials present at the cabinet meeting chaired by the chief minister Chandrababu Naidu at Secretariat in Velagapudi on Thursday, said that the suspension of big currency notes have left the revenue paralysed. ""If the situation continues to be the same, there will be no surprise if we lose Rs.1000 crore during the current fiscal only due to the demonetization,"" the officials explained.    However, the chief minister said to have backed the move for the better future of the country. Although, the there would be some short-term pains, the decision would help the country in the longer run, said CM. He asked the officials to explore measures to be taken to compensate the lost revenues. He said that he would take up the matter with the union finance minister Arun Jaitley. The ministers, however, expressed their serious concern about the restrictions being imposed on gold sales and stocks. Ministers requested the chief minister to take the issue to the notice of the prime minister. ""We will face combined ire of the women if the restrictions being imposed on gold ornaments that could be hold by women,"" ministers said. Some of the ministers explained the chief minister that shortage of small currencies has become a big headache for them too. They said that people were criticizing them for not disbursing the welfare pensions in cash. A senior minister said that farmers have become biggest victims of the suspension of big notes. ""We are unable to convince them as Centre has showed step-motherly treatment with the cooperative banks,"" minister explained. Chief minister said that the issue would be subsided within a month as they would be ready to disburse the cash from next month. The cabinet had decided to grant another 3.5 lakh welfare pensions during the next janma bhoomi programme.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/Andhra-Pradesh-Ministers-and-Officials-Cries-Foul-over-Demonetisation/articleshow/55745280.cms,amaravati

2016-12-03 04:00:00,Govt unveils special bonds to soak up demonetised funds,"Mumbai: The government on Friday created provisions to issue special bonds worth up to Rs 6 lakh crore to absorb the temporary surplus with banks created by nationwide deposits of demonetised currency, which crossed Rs 8 lakh crore last weekend.    The RBI will sell the bonds, called Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), to banks on behalf of the government. Although the MSS is an existing programme, the current limit was only Rs 30,000 crore, which has been hiked to Rs 6 lakh crore. Money raised by sale of these bonds cannot be used by the government and does not add to the fiscal deficit.    The first tranche of the MSS bonds on Friday drew Rs 20,000 crore at a cut-off yield of 6.16%. Armed with the new instrument to soak funds, the RBI might relax its rules of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement, under which it has impounded Rs 3.2 lakh crore of bank deposits. On Wednesday, when the RBI announces the monetary policy committee's decision on interest rates, it is also expected to provide a timeline for reducing CRR.    Although over Rs 8 lakh crore have come in as deposits post-demonetisation, the money can't be put to long-term use as most of these are expected to be withdrawn. The surge in deposits has forced banks to invest in liquid money market instruments, causing volatility. To maintain order, it was imperative for the RBI to lock up some of the funds.    The cost of impounding these funds were first borne by the RBI, which borrowed under the reverse repo facility in exchange for bonds. On November 25, the amount parked with the RBI under reverse repo crossed Rs 5.2 lakh crore. Since the central bank was on the verge of running out of government bonds, it passed the cost onto banks by asking them to lock funds up to Rs 3.25 lakh crore in the form of cash reserves with the central bank, which would not earn any interest.    This sudden change of rules created a situation where banks were incurring a loss of about Rs 50 crore every day in terms of the interest payout for the extra cash they were receiving due to demonetisation. Now to compensate banks for these losses, the government and the RBI are issuing MSS bonds.    ""MSS will suffice to drain the excess liquidity from the system if managed properly,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser (economic research department), SBI. ""We maintain that the temporary incremental CRR hike may now be withdrawn. Otherwise, the two together may work as a double whammy in terms of pushing up government securities yield and impending bank lending transmission,"" Ghosh said.    After the sharp rise in deposits since mid-November and the abrupt hike in CRR, expectation of an MSS bond issue rose. Last week, RBI governor Urjit Patel had also said that the unprecedented increase in CRR was a temporary measure until the government increased the limit to issue MSS bonds.    Since MSS was meant to absorb excess liquidity, bonds witnessed selling with the benchmark yield on 10-year gilts rising to 6.27% from its Thursday's close at 6.21%. In Friday's extended trading hour in the government bond market, the yield finally settled at 6.24%.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Govt-unveils-special-bonds-to-soak-up-demonetised-funds/articleshow/55760886.cms,

Women customers helped Sarvesha Devi, a resident of Sardarpur Ke Majra Shahpur Dera, deliver the male child, her fifth, on the premises of the bank.    The bank officials later apprised local police, who then rushed them to the Jhinjhak community health centre (CHC).    A senior bank official told TOI that Sarvesha Devi, who had come to withdraw Rs 5,000 for depositing the instalment of Lohia Awas loan, was standing in the queue since 11 am. ""Her mother-in-law Shashi Devi had brought her to the bank despite her pregnancy ,"" he said.    He added that as soon as Sarvesha went into labour, the locals called the `108' ambulance service run by the state government. But as labour pains became unbearable, the women customers surrounded her and helped her deliver the baby inside the bank,"" he said.    ""The woman gave birth to the child at around 3.45 p.m.while the bank was flooded with customers. Both the woman and the child are admitted to the Jhinjhak CHC. Doc tors said their condition is stable,"" he said.    ""The sad part of the story is that the woman had lost her husband, Jasmernath, about three months ago following prolonged illness.""    ""Bank customers informed me that a woman had gone into labour while standing in queue for cash. As soon as I rushed to the spot, I found that the woman had delivered,"" manager of Punjab National Bank, Jhinjhak branch, S K Chaudhary told TOI.    Rajveer, a local who was at the queue at the time, said that long queues are everyday affair at banks and ATMs in the district since demonetisation.""The scarcity of cash has been brought to the notice of bank officers, but they have paid no heed.

2016-12-03 05:22:00,Demonetisation: Congress seeks relief for co-operative banks,"NEW DELHI: With the Supreme Court taking up the issue of transferring petitions against demonetisation in different high courts to one place, chaos descended on the Chief Justice of India's courtroom on Friday with outstation petitioners and advocates attempting to draw the court's attention to their pleas.    Amid the din in a jampacked courtroom, Congress leaders and senior advocates Kapil Sibal and P Chidambaram made a stinging criticism of the Centre's decision to keep district cooperative banks out of the post-demonetisation exercise of exchanging scrapped high value currency notes for new ones. They said, ""As many as 371 district cooperative banks have been shut since November 9. They used to cater to a large section of farmers and rural population. Farmers have nowhere to go to get their money to buy seeds. The way things were handled by the government, it has hurt the rural economy beyond repair.""    Appearing for Solapur district cooperative bank, senior advocate C U Singh said he supported the demonetisation scheme. ""But the district cooperative banks have a strange problem. The government permitted the cooperative banks to receive old currency notes till November 13. Between November 9 and 13, we collected around Rs 300 crore in scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. These notes collected by cooperative banks are now not accepted by the currency chest of State Bank of India. Please direct SBI to take the cash.""    A bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justice D Y Chandrachud immediately accepted that the court could look into problems faced by farmers and rural folk because of district cooperative banks being kept out. It asked attorney general Mukul Rohatgi why these small banks were not being allowed to cater to the rural population.    Rohatgi said, ""The government has taken a conscious decision not to allow cooperative banks to receive demonetised currency as these do not have the expertise and automation to detect fake Indian currency notes. The Centre's affidavit deals with this issue in detail.""    As advocates and petitioners from other parts of the country, eager to press their point of view, created a din, a smiling CJI said it would be impossible to conduct the proceedings if they did not maintain discipline. The CJI asked Sibal, Chidambaram and additional solicitor general Maninder Singh to meet over the weekend, discuss the issues raised in the petitions pending before the HCs and identify those which could be taken up for hearing on Monday.    The Centre explained why cooperative banks had been kept out of the loop. ""District Central Cooperative Banks... have low level of automation as also low order of professionalism among their staff. Their capability to detect fake notes is also low. These, therefore, have been some of the reasons which prompted the authorities to keep them off from exchanging the specified notes for public or accepting them for deposit to the credit of their customers' accounts.""",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Congress-seeks-relief-for-co-operative-banks/articleshow/55763075.cms,

Meera Katheria, who works as a domestic help in a house near head post office, said, ""My sister-in-law passed away on Wednesday and I asked my employer for my salary as my relatives in Badaun needed money. However, she gave me Rs 5,000 in denominations of scrapped Rs 500 notes. Even after depositing the banned notes at the post office, I could not get money as the cash got over there. I somehow managed to borrow Rs 1,000 from my friends and went to Badaun to participate in the last rites.""  Ravi Yadav, who delivers milk at 70 houses in Civil Lines area, said, ""In November, everyone paid me in the banned currency notes as they said that they do not have time to stand in serpentine queues. Four customers paid me in advance. As I faced severe inconvenience in depositing the money in my bank account last month, I insisted on cash payment in valid currency this time. However, only three customers have paid me so far, while others told me that they are still arranging cash.""  Kanti Katheriya, who works as a cook, said, ""When my employers gave me old currency notes, I refused to accept it. However, they said that they do not have money as they could not manage to withdraw it from banks and will pay me next month. As I needed money to run my house, I accepted scrapped notes.""  However, employers say that they are compelled to delay payments as they have no option. Abha Kapoor, who is a housewife, said, ""My husband works in Moradabad and I have to manage the household on my own. I stood in queues twice outside ATMs but cash exhausted before my turn came. My husband will be home on Sunday, but the banks will be closed. I will be able to withdraw only Rs 2000 from ATM.

2016-12-03 11:51:00,Industry body Credai says housing prices may go up by 20% post demonetisation,"BENGALURU: Realtor's body Credai said real estate prices has a chance to rise by about 20% in the next one year post demonetisation as builders go slow on new launches, introduction of the new regulatory bill and higher input cost.    New launches are expected to dry up rapidly as realtors adopt a wait and watch approach and customers anticipate a further drop in housing prices. The situation will be aggravated as new approvals will be slow and builders will have to be more compliant with the Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA) which comes into effect next year.    ""The idea of a drop in housing prices by about 20-30% is far-fetched. Builders, at least in Bengaluru, are working on wafer thin PAT (profit after tax) margins of 8-10%. There is no scope of further decline,"" Credai chairman Irfan Razack said on Friday.    Razack, who also heads Prestige Estates, added that housing prices have remained depressed in the last few years and have not kept up with inflation. ""The only direction for prices is to head north because there will be a constraint in supply due to fewer launches.""    Developers have gone slow on launches in the last few years as sales remain sluggish, inventory piles up, debt levels reach alarming proportions and consumer sentiment remains low. All these have been a drag on a sector which contributes about 7% to India's GDP and is the second biggest employer after agriculture.    ""The RERA will put a lot of unorganised players out of the market as they will not be able to start any project before they have all requisite certificates with them. Moreover approvals have been slow and input cost, including labour cost, is set to go up,"" said Razack.    He, however, admitted there will be a minor price correction in the immediate aftermath of the government's decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as legal tenders. ""The consumer sentiment has of course turned negative but it may result in a drop in price by about 5%, nothing more.""    Bengaluru, according to Razack, will be one of the least affected cities due to demonetisation as it is a predominantly end-user market, driven by home loans unlike the NCR which is mostly speculative. Driven mainly by a salaried class, the dealing is primarily through banking channels.    Sobha managing director J C Sharma said the move by the government would result in lowering of lending rates thus making housing more affordable to all. ""We require about 4.2 million homes in the next four years and with supply shortage, prices can only go up,"" he said.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Industry-body-Credai-says-housing-prices-may-go-up-by-20-post-demonetisation/articleshow/55767593.cms,
2016-12-03 16:36:00,Bengaluru one of the least affected cities post demonetisation: CREDAI,"BENGALURU: Bengaluru is one of the least affected cities due to the  demonetisation+  move as the market here has been predominantly transparent with cash transactions almost being negligible, Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (CREDAI) said.    ""Bengaluru is one of the least affected cities,the reason being the market here has predominantly been transparent and cash transactions are almost negligible,"" CREDAI chairman Irfan Razack told reporters.    The expectation that real estate prices will come down in Bengaluru market due to demonetisation is mere exaggeration as there is no real basis for this, he said.    Driven largely by the salaried class in the IT and ITES sector, the market here is more end-user/consumer centric, dealing primarily through banking channels, Razack said.    He said the Bengaluru market had seen correction recently and is currently one of the most attractively priced markets in the country.    Razack also said the demonetisation announcement would help small but organised players get a fair and level playing field, giving rise to healthy competition and high quality delivery of projects.    ""This announcement ensures that while bigger players will continue to gain ground, even smaller but organised developers will get a fair and level-playing field, giving rise to healthy competition and high quality delivery of projects.""    All this is expected to make the industry more systematic, robust and reliable, creating an atmosphere that is conducive to FDI, institutional investors and the like, he added.    However, some markets have been impacted temporarily, Razack, who is also Chairman and Managing Director of the Prestige Group, said.    CREDAI Bengaluru and Sobha Limited Vice Chairman and Managing Director J C Sharma said demonetisation is a good step and would not have any negative impact on the real estate industry here, barring this quarter.    The move would also eventually result in interest and lending rates coming down, making housing more affordable to all and expect the market to consolidate further, Sharma said.    Later, CREDAI released a report - ""Emerging Trends in Real Estate Asia Pacific 2017 - report by PwC,which highlights that investors are more focused on yields and returns from an investment rather than just safety.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/Bengaluru-one-of-the-least-affected-cities-post-demonetisation-CREDAI/articleshow/55769745.cms,bengaluru

The advisory states that as micro-ATMs work with minimal power and connect to central banking servers through a GPRS network, their  security features need to be strong+  and updated to check attempts by hackers who stealthily plan to steal private customer and bank data which leads to loss of their hard earned money by way of hacking or electronic stealing.    ""Traditionally, data input into the POS system is in memory in clear text which allows attackers, memory scrapers to be very successful.    ""The way to minimise this risk is by encrypting the card data as soon as possible and keeping it encrypted to the maximum extent throughout its life within the system. Point to Point Encryption (P2PE) could be used to address the issue of encrypting data in memory,"" the advisory, accessed by PTI, said.    It explains that skimming is the theft of classified credit/debit card data.    ""A thief can obtain the victim's credit card number using a small electronic device near the card acceptance slot and store hundreds of victims' credit card numbers,"" it said.    A social engineering attack can be engineered at these facilities, it added, by gaining trust of the owner as the fraudster poses as a member of staff.    ""The fraudster would then ask the customer to check the card for damages. The fraudster would have gained confidence from his prey using various tactics such as offering assistance to the customer who perhaps would have tried to use the ATM without success or perhaps the customer who is not familiar with use of micro ATM machine and requires assistance,"" it said.    A micro ATM enables the un-banked rural population to access banking services in their villages or towns in a convenient manner and it offers facilities of deposit, withdrawal, funds transfer, balance enquiry and issuance of mini-statement.    The agency has asked the banks and micro ATM operators to exercise some counter-measures to thwart such attacks.    ""The micro ATM must not transmit any confidential data unencrypted on the network; it must automatically log out the operator and lock itself after a period of inactivity; keep all the micro ATM software, application, anti-virus regularly updated and educate the customer about basic functionalities and security best practises,"" the advisory by Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) said.    It also suggested customers to render due diligence of securing their PIN and not sharing vital details with strangers.    With regard to POS systems, the place where a retail transaction occurs and the merchant charges payment from the customer via a debit/credit card, the agency has alerted users against the use of skimmer device ""that scans a customer's card and stores the information contained in the magnetic strip"" and hacks into it to defraud.    The advisory specifically talks against the destructive activity of a virus called 'POS malware', a type of malicious software, that is ""used by cyber criminals to target POS terminals with the intent to obtaining credit/debit card information by reading the device memory from the retail checkout point of sale system.""    The CERT-In advisory recommended deployment of strong and effective anti-virus and firewalls and restricting of access to the internet system of the POS terminal.    ""All POS devices owners should change passwords of their POS systems on a regular basis, using unique account names and complex passwords; should ensure that all their Wi-Fi and internet connections are secured; merchants may modulate the signal strength of their Wi-Fi network so that it does not extend too far from the area of use or shop and ensuring that no electronic/magnetic devices are attached with POS systems"" are some of the combat measures suggested by the agency for traders.",business,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Micro-ATMs-Point-of-Sale-asked-to-guard-against-cyber-attacks/articleshow/55788292.cms,

But I believe that the decision to scrap high-value banknotes would push GDP growth up by two per cent,"" he told PTI.

He served as the Prime Minister for 10 years. I fail to understand why has he not been able to check mismanagement in these monumental offices?""

Rubbishing the Opposition's charge that the government did not make proper arrangements for demonetisation, the minister said ""the government set up an SIT on black money, rolled out the Income Declaration Scheme and took several steps which were part of the preparations.

""For the last one week, I met over 30 vendors to sell my product. But they had no money to buy it. The workers were asking for their wages, but I C UR had no money to pay them and manage my daily needs,"" said CR the farmer.Demonetisation has badlyhit the cardamom trading sector in the district. Lack of currency flow was severely affecting the auction and sale of cardamom.Last month, over two days of cardamom auction was stopped in the area and then resumed. The vendors were cool towards the cardamom auction at Puttady and Bodinaikanur in Tamil Nadu.Earlier, most of the traders from Tamil Nadu used to attend the cardamom auc tion in each center. But fol lowing the demonetisation, they were not doing so. Over 60 traders used to attend ev ery cardamom auction at Puttady Spices Park earlier, but now only 25 were attend ing it. In Bodinayakanur, over 120 traders were present in every auction, but now the number has dipped to only 30 to 40. Most of the small NC scale farmers in the ar Y ea like Kumily , Anavi lasam, Anakkara, Vel laramkunnu and Kat IS tappana usually sell their cardamom through small-scale vendors.But curbs on money with drawal from the banks have badly affected the small scale vendors.Now a vendor is getting only Rs 24,000 every week from the bank from their sav ing account and Rs 50,000 from their current account.Abbas, a cardamom ven dor from Kumily , pointed out that with the cardamom price touching Rs 1,200-1,400 per kg, now one can buy only 20-30 kg of cardamom every week.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/Cardamom-farmers-in-Idukki-hit-hard-by-demonetisation/articleshow/55784980.cms,kochi
2016-12-04 14:29:00,Demonetization despair for Tundi artisans,"DHANBAD: Artisans of Tundi block are barely scraping through after demonetization. Most of the artisans in this Maoist hit block make bamboo products for a living and now, these families are neither able to buy raw materials nor sell their finished products in the wholesale market. Denomination of Rs 2,000 currency poses a new challenge for them as it is too big an amount for their petty needs.    Mohan Mohali, a resident of the village, told TOI that he along with his three family members manage to earn Rs 6,000 a month but since note ban, the earning has stopped. ""It is a big blow to our livelihood and none of the local leaders, politicians or government authorities have taken pains to see our condition. Now a days boiled rice is our breakfast, lunch and dinner as there is no loose change to buy pulses or vegetables,"" said Mohali.    Aasandabur village which is a part of Ojhadih Katania panchayat has nearly 45 houses and apart from one person who has passed Class X, the rest are uneducated and only depend on bamboo-weaving business. Chhatabad, the village adjacent to Aasandabur, has 40 minority families earning their living by making wooden rolling pins and cots and is in a similar plight. ""We usually sell our products in the wholesale market or take our product to Bihar and sell door-to-door. Loose currency is required at every step right from bus fare to daily food expenses. As we belong to a Maoist dominated area, the traders refuse to give us raw materials on loan,"" said Salim Kazi, an artisan who makes rolling pins.    Another village of the same panchayat, Rajak Tola, is a hub of broom manufacturers. This village sells brooms across the state and in a few districts of Bihar and West Bengal. Their business has also taken a hit due to the shortage of cash.Tundi block pramukh Kamla Murmu, while speaking to TOI, said that absence of Rs 500 notes is the main hurdle for the artisans. She added that the grievances would be voiced at the zila parishad meet soon. Murmu also said that most of the villagers do not have bank accounts and the usage of plastic money and other alternatives are out of the question as people here are not educated.    DC A Dodde said that immediate steps would be taken to help out the poor. He added a team of bankers and district authorities would be sent on Sunday to take stock of the situation and address the grievances.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/Demonetization-despair-for-Tundi-artisans/articleshow/55788701.cms,ranchi
2016-12-04 14:45:00,Perk up govt spending to limit the impact of demonetisation: Assocham,"MANGALURU: As private consumption would be taking a significant hit on account of cash crunch in the economy at least in the next two quarters, the government should make all efforts to at least partly limit the impact of demonetisation on the GDP by sharply jacking up its own expenditure during the fiscal 2016-17, the ASSOCHAM said.    Measured in terms of expenditure, the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) or popularly known as the ' India consumption story' accounts for close to 60% of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices and 55% at constant prices (base 2011-12).    ""With 86% of the cash out of circulation and replenishment facing difficulties, the PFCE in the third quarter is expected to see a sizeable reduction to the extent of at least 35-40% and slightly lower in the fourth quarter. Surely, when an important component accounting for 60% of the GDP takes a hit to this extent, the overall impact is bound to be significant,"" the ASSOCHAM said.    In terms of numbers, the PFCE, at current prices, was estimated at Rs 21.78 lakh crore in Q2 of 2016-17 with a growth of 12.4% over the similar period last year. At constant prices, it was estimated at Rs 16.26 lakh crore for the July-September quarter of the current fiscal with the growth of 7.6%.    Different ministries which have been earmarked the annual budget, should exceed their expenditure aggressively in case the damage control has to be effected from the demonetisation in the short to medium term. The government expenditure itself accounts for a good part of the GDP to the extent of 14%.    ""As against Rs 5.15 lakh crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal, the government expenditure , at market prices, should be jacked up to Rs 7 lakh crore for each of the third and fourth quarter, even if some fiscal imbalances take place for the sake of growth,"" ASSOCHAM said.    The chamber said focus should be on sectors like roads and highways, ports, railways, telecom infrastructure, irrigation, flood control and rural uplift programmes.

Sitharaman was in the city on Sunday to lay the foundation stone of extension campus of Indian Institute of Gems and Jewellery Mumbai. During a brief chat with reporters she said, ""Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision of demonetising Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes opposition was expecting that countrymen would show resentment against it. However, despite considering that this decision has generated immediate problems for them, they all are praising the decision of demonetisation.""    She said that same reaction of countrymen increased pressure on opposition and they found it difficult to stick with one stand. ""With the commencement of Parliament session from November 16, they kept changing their stand. Initially, they demanded discussion on the issue in both houses. When Modi government agreed for it they started demanding PM's clarification and Modi's presence in house. They also decided to observe Jan Akrosh Divas.

2016-12-04 07:56:00,Demonetisation foils cyber criminals’ plans,"PUNE: The increasing inaccessibility to ATMs and more user vigilance since the government decided to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has ruined the plans of most cyber criminals.    There has been a sudden dip in the number of complaints on digital transaction frauds with the Pune cyber crime cell since demonetisation. This, despite an increase in the usage of credit, debit cards and net-banking payments.    Twenty-nine card and ATM-related complaints were lodged with the police between November 1 and 10. That number has dropped to 21 between November 11 and 21, officials said. Cyber crime experts attribute this drop to the unavailability of ATMs, among other causes.    According to senior inspector Sunil Pawar, the cell receives an average of three such complaints each day.    ""However, from November 11 to 21, we have received around 21 complaints related to online frauds. Demonetisation seems to have made users more vigilant while making online and card transactions,"" said Pawar.    Anshul Abhang, managing director of the city-based Deltaproactive Risk Management Private Limited, said, ""There has been no real surge in cybercrimes related to credit cards, online transactions and ATM frauds in the last 10 days. This is a far cry from the prediction that cybercrimes may increase after demonetisation. The difficulty in accessing ATMs has played a role. Hence exploiting them has been very difficult (for the criminals).""    Cybercrime expert Kirtar Oza elaborated on this, saying ATM frauds require the physical presence of crooks at ATMs, to install skimmers and cameras.    ""They also need to physically remove these devices after a few days, once they steal enough data. After demonetisation, ATMs have become a hotspot, bustling with multitudes of people. Crooks therefore cannot dare to do any illegal activities in such a setting,"" said Oza.    Since demonetisation, Oza said, it has also become difficult for criminals to carry out phone fraud. ""People have been physically present at their banks and moreover, they have become more vigilant towards any communication from banks,"" he said, ""in such a situation, it would be hard to entrap people by faking a call on behalf of the banks.""    Ashay Rege, director, Synclature — a cybersecurity and risk advisory company — thought along similar lines. ""There has been no room for cyber attackers to have physical access to ATMs,"" he said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Demonetisation-foils-cyber-criminals-plans/articleshow/55780057.cms,pune

November, when wedding season is in full swing, means big sales for flower growers such as Kumar. This year, however, they have recorded massive losses since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that high-value currency notes would go. According to sources in the Uttar Pradesh department of horticulture, flower mandis in western UP are reporting over a 50% drop in sales. Customers, who simply do not have cash to spare, are skipping flower decorations. Kumar, however, said official figures are an ""underestimation"" as sales have dropped by almost 80%.    ""We have been receiving distressing reports from flower mandis from all over the region. According to those on the ground, sales have dropped over 50%. One of the worst-hit districts is Saharanpur, which also serves markets in Haryana and Uttarakhand. This is the season when flowers such as Rajanigandha and Jawara are in high demand. This is, after all, the wedding season. There is a severe cash crunch in the market. People are either not buying flowers, buying less flowers or buying on credit. The problem with the last scenario is that flower sellers are not able to pay farmers who come to them,"" a senior horticulture official said on condition of anonymity.    Ashwini Kumar, however, says the situation is so bad that flower growers are not even able to meet their costs. ""I own a greenhouse spread over 1 acre of land in Behat, Saharanpur. The monthly cost of running the greenhouse is around Rs 1.25 lakh. Paying the wages of labourers alone costs me around Rs. 50,000. We used to earn Rs 15,000 on a daily basis by selling flowers in the mandi. Around the wedding season, the earnings can even go as far up as Rs. 25,000 per day. Not only do we cover costs, we also make massive profits from horticulture. Ever since demonetisation, however, the profits have dipped significantly. Now, we only earn about Rs. 3,000 from selling flowers. This comes to around Rs. 90,000 per month.""    He added, ""This is not enough. Even if I have enough money to feed my family and run my household, what do I do about my workers? I have to pay them in cash since not all of them have bank accounts. Those that do have bank accounts say that the money will be of no use to them since the banks in Saharanpur district run out of cash by noon. Besides, I am not earning enough to pay them anyway.

Leader of opposition in assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and his counterpart in council Dhananjay Munde also suggested registering offences under Section 302 (murder) of IPC against the government for the deaths of over hundred citizens standing in serpentine queues to withdraw money.    While announcing the boycott of CM Devendra Fadnavis's customary tea party, the duo demanded allocation of Rs15,000-Rs20,000 crore to provide compensation to demonetisation victims. They will be deciding whether to boycott proceedings in both houses during their combined meeting on Monday morning.    Peasants and Workers Party's (PWP) member Jayant Patil, People's Republican Party's (PRP) Jogendra Kawade, NCP's MLC Prakash Gajbhiye and others accompanied them during the joint press meet.    Accusing the government of waiving loans to the tune of Rs70,000 crore of defaulters like Vijay Mallya with money gathered through demonetisation, they said the government was keen on restructuring nationalized banks, which were in losses due to huge defaults. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi says he had left his home and mother to serve the country. But who invited him? Why was he featured in an advertisement by a private organization?""    Equating Nagpur with Bihar, they declared Nagpur as ""crime capital of the state"" and flayed Fadnavis for his failure to curb crime. ""Despite being CM's home city, it's in the news daily for gruesome murders, that too near his home. He has also failed to curb Naxal movement in Vidarbha. The police are being threatened by BJP's elected representatives. If cops are not safe, where should the common person go?""    They also said the industrial sector growth had slowed during saffron party rule in Maharashtra, which once was a leading state. ""Even declaration of Rs36,000 crore investment by Foxconn turned out to be fake.""    Asserting that economy in rural areas had collapsed completely due to demonetisation, they demanded the government request the centre to waive off farmers loans using the demonetisation funds. ""Right from farmers to workers to shopkeepers, everyone is suffering. Collectively, they have suffered losses of Rs20,000 crore. They've stopped cooperative bank from exchanging old notes, but how are they allowing private companies like Big Bazaar, De Mart and Pay TM to provide money?""    The duo further accused the government of misleading people on granting reservation to Maratha and Dhangar communities.

There is still one month to go and the banks have already received 9 lakh crore. This is all good money and showcases that the black money, which the government is running after, is not present in this form,” general secretary of AIBEA, C H Venkatachalam, said, adding that instead of demonetizing the currency, the government should have focused on improving the anti-corruption laws and improve the taxation policy.    While announcing the nine resolutions that were passed by the Goa Bank Employees Association, Venkatachalam said that the current taxation policies are regressive.    “There is a need for different brackets of taxation for different income group. Why should a poor man and the Ambanis file same percentage of tax?” Venkatachalam asked, while stating that the government’s failure to initiate criminal proceedings against wishful defaulters was hurting the economy.    The association also moved a formal resolution against the privatization and amalgamation of major government banks and warned of protests and agitation against any such move by the government.    “India needs to expand its banking network rather than consolidating it. Any move to amalgamate the nationalized banks will be protested.

Builders buy 4 flats for Rs 119cr in own project at Worli,"MUMBAI: Demonetisation came as a jolt to the real estate industry with experts predicting it could further slow down sales due to the ban on old high value notes. But barely a week after it was announced, a mega residential property deal was struck in Mumbai.    On November 15, the registration office recorded a Rs 119-crore transaction for four luxury apartments in Omkar Realtors and Developer's 1973 project at Worli. What has raised eyebrows is not the price, but the fact that the buyers are none other than the promoters of the realty company themselves.    ""This is a strange case where the builder has bought apartments in his own project,'' said an industry insider.    The sprawling flats have been registered under the names of Babulal Varma, Omkar's co-founder and managing director, and Gaurav Gupta, a partner described as the youngest director in the firm.    Documents made available to this newspaper show the builders purchased flats on the 53rd and 54th floors in Tower B of the project. Each apartment is 5,500 sq ft to 6,800 sq ft in area and comes with four car parking slots. Two flats on the 54th floor are registered in Verma's name; they cost over Rs 28 crore each. Two apartments on the 53rd floor show Gupta as the buyer; he paid Rs 63 crore for them.    Verma told TOI the apartments were bought ""three to four years ago"" but registered last month. ""Several of our company directors have booked flats in this project,"" he said. He said all the payments were by cheque.    The Omkar website describes Varma as a ""people person'' who has ""seamlessly embedded qualities of diligence, integrity and punctuality in all aspects of the business ensuring value for all stakeholders''. Gupta, on the other hand, has ""natural flair for leadership as he takes centrestage by implementing best practices...""    Omkar has emerged as Mumbai's largest slum redeveloper in less than a decade with projects from Worli to Malad.

2016-12-05 05:07:00,"20 days after demonetisation, 3.4% of all notes returned are counterfeit","BENGALURU: One of the main objectives of the government's decision to demonetise the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was to root out fake notes, which are used for terror funding among other crimes.    However, according to documents available with TOI, only 1.39 lakh (3.4% of all notes returned) fake notes with a face value of Rs 9.63 crore had been returned to the banking system by November 27, nearly 20 days after the demonetisation decision kicked in.    This forms an extremely small share of the estimated face value of fake Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in circulation. In the first half of 2016, the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) had pegged the face value of fake notes in circulation at Rs 400 crore — Rs 1,000 notes accounted for 50% of the sum, while the old Rs 500 accounted for at least 25%. According to the ISI's estimates, together, the fake notes of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations had a face value of Rs 300 crore.    This means that the fake notes deposited in the wake of the demonetisation announcement account for just 3.2% of the estimated face value of the counterfeit bills in circulation. Experts say this is an indication that either the majority of the fake notes are with terror groups or black money hoarders, who cannot return these notes. There is a chance more of these will be returned by the December 30 deadline.    A senior IPS officer who has dealt with terror modules said: ""If we are to say that terror groups had most of this money, then it would have made its way to the market, because stocking money isn't of use to them. They are pumped with fake currency with a dual agenda: One, to fund themselves. And two, to destabilize our economy by infiltrating our system with such notes.""",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/20-days-after-demonetisation-34-of-all-notes-returned-are-counterfeit/articleshow/55800888.cms,

Interestingly, it was while crossing UP's Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 10 that this Lithuania-based civil engineer happened to feel its impact. When Seilius reached Agra, he only had some US dollars and demonetized Indian currencies left with him.    Adding to his woes, no one accepted his international credit card. An attempt to exchange dollars with Indian currency didn't work as the exchange centres had only demonetized notes. ""I had covered more than 12,000km on road by the time I reached Agra.

The shift timings changed officers at the parcel booking counter, so we faced a difficult time. What we had was a couple of Rs 2,000 notes which we couldn't use as no one had change for that.

2016-12-05 08:52:00,"Demonetisation will be the end of Modi, says Hindu Mahasabha","AGRA: Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being anti-Hindu, senior members of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha have said that the Centre's demonetisation move would be the beginning of the end of his rule. The saffron organisation alleged that the policy had been introduced just before the start of the Hindu wedding season while BJP members were encouraging Islamic banks in the country.    Questioning the government's currency move, Mahasabha's national general secretary Pooja Shakun Pandey said the purpose of the scheme is yet not known. ""Poor people, those who earn Rs 200-300 every day or those who survive on paltry government pensions, are the ones who are suffering. The move doesn't seem to have made an impact on the rich,"" she said in Aligarh.    ""Besides, it was announced just before the Hindu wedding season. Thousands of families were forced to borrow money from their friends and relatives, some others had to postpone, curtail or even cancel the ceremonies. At the same time, leaders of the so called Hindutva party were busy promoting Islamic banking in the country,"" she said.    Pandey was referring to Sholapur's BJP MLA and Maharashtra cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh who launched the country's first sharia-compliant Islamic banking service in Sholapur in September. At the Lokmangal Cooperative Bank Ltd, controlled by Deshmukh, interest-free deposits will be accepted from both Muslims and non-Muslims and distributed largely to the needy from the minority community at zero rates of interest to ensure their financial inclusion.    Alleging that Modi's ""Hindutva"" mask was now off for all to see, a Mahasabha member said, ""Demonetisation would eventually lead to de-Modi-tisation of the country.""    Mahasabha's members also accused Modi of trying to garner support for ""fake"" surgical strikes. Its UP spokesperson, Ashok Kumar Pandey, said, ""Cross-border terrorism has gone up. Our soldiers are dying in border skirmishes every day. The surgical strikes, if there were any, haven't done the country any good."" Taking on ""aggressive"" Modi supporters, Pandey said, ""They have created a fear psychosis in the country by branding all those opposed to PM's policies or ideas as 'anti-nationals'. That leaves common people who are hugely inconvenienced by the cash crunch with no other choice than hailing the move.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/Demonetisation-will-be-the-end-of-Modi-says-Hindu-Mahasabha/articleshow/55801241.cms,agra
2016-12-05 07:41:00,"Sharad Pawar visits bank, does a U-turn on demonetisation","The NCP president Sharad Pawar unexpectedly on Sunday visited a nationalized bank in Baramati, his home town to know for himself the plight of the customers after demonetization. Besides a marathon meeting with the branch manager, Pawar had a brief interaction with the customers too. Customers brought to his notice that post demonetization life in rural parts has become very difficult, as banks have failed to provide cash. Prima facie, it appears that while intentions of demonetization were good, the RBI and leading financial institutions were unable to tackle the situation.    Pawar pointed out that in rural parts of the country, more than 92 per cent of the transactions are by cash. His views assumes political significance, since he was the first opposition member to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetization plan, saying. At a juncture when the entire opposition led by Congress had opposed the demonetization plan, Pawar's statement stunned and surprised not only the Congress and major opposition parties, but also his own party leaders. For more than a week, state NCP leaders had maintained a complete silence over the decision. When the Congress-led opposition parties decided to launch a nationwide protest against demonetization plan, NCP leadership realized that its decision to support Modi was wrong, particularly in view of the ensuing elections to the BMC.  Need of the hour  More than a year after he took over the reins of the BMC, high profile bureaucrat Ajoy Mehta has realized that all is not well there. Says Mehta, the condition of footpaths is so bad that it was not possible for him to take his father for a walk. He is not the first municipal commissioner to make such observations, but most of his predecessors too had similar experience. One of the reasons for the near collapse of the city is the fact that there is no fear for law - both among the citizens as well as the BMC employees owing to rampant political interference at all levels. Way back in 1996, when senior Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi was the chief minister, the urban development department had issued a circular, saying, senior inspector of police and ward officer will be personally held responsible for illegal and unauthorized constructions and encroachments on the foot path. Mehta will have to make all the additional municipal commissioners, DMCs and ward officers more accountable and visible.  Go by the rules  Farmers' leader and head of the state-run Vasantrao Naik Mission for welfare of farmers, Kishore Tiwari's new order has surprised bureaucrats. Their contention is that Tiwari has exceeded his brief and his order has no legal validity. Ever since Tiwari took over the reins of the mission, he has been visiting rural parts to know the plight of farmers, particularly in drought-affected areas. A week ago, when Tiwari was in Yavatmal, he found that most officials in the public health centre and teachers in the school were absent. Shocked, he asked collector Sachin Pratap Singh to immediately suspend all absent officials without a notice. But high ranking bureaucrats feel that if proper procedure is not followed, the erring officials will approach the court and secure stay on the suspension order, which will be a major embarrassment for the administration.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Pawar-visits-bank-does-a-U-turn-on-demonetisation/articleshow/55797947.cms,mumbai
2016-12-05 08:13:00,Swipe machines increase in North Karnataka after demonetization,"HUBBALLI: Since November 8, when the government announced demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, many traders and shopkeepers in North Karnataka are now showing interest in point-of-sale (PoS) devices or swipe machines.    Banks have also gone aggressive by promoting these devices among traders to avoid the cash crunch prevailing post-demonetization. The number of swipe machine users has increased by over 100% since November 8. And people are also making a beeline to apply for debit and credit cards at various banks — something which was uncommon in North Karnataka till recently.    Deepak Shanvi, a manager with Vijaya Bank, informed that his bank supplied more than 60 swipe machines in Dharwad, Gadag, Ballary and Belagavi after November 10. ""Customers are showing interest in purchasing swipe machines for making easy transaction. We are receiving a good response from the public also as many have applied for debit and credit cards for making cashless transaction,"" he said.    Parshwanath, manager in Canara Bank's regional office, said they have supplied 50 swipe machines after demonetization and received more than 200 applications for the same. ""But we are facing scarcity of swipe machines and we will supply as per consumers demand shortly,"" he assured.    ""We have provided 178 swipe machines from April to October. In November, we have supplied 120 machines in the North Karnataka region,"" said an officer with SBI bank who wished not to be named.    Sudha D S, a government schoolteacher, stated that she never used her debit card before demonetization, but after demonetization, she did it four times. ""Now it's necessary to use debit card because we don't have any other option,"" she said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/Swipe-machines-increase-in-North-Karnataka-after-demonetization/articleshow/55796030.cms,hubballi
2016-12-05 14:00:00,Demonetisation: Mamata Banerjee asks colleagues to raise objections over GST implementation,"KOLKATA: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is on warpath with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation and apparently, she is not missing any chance to attack him. Now, the Goods and Service Tax, due in April 2017, seems to be the latest casualty of demonetisation.    Evidently, the fifth GST council meeting held on 2-3 December remained ""inconclusive"" . This is for the fifth time when the all-powerful council could not reach a consensus on the ""dual control"" issue.    Sources in Trinamool ranks confirmed that Banerjee has instructed her colleagues in Parliament and in the GST council to raise objections over the implementation of the new tax regime saying, the country would not be able to bear two consecutive financial shocks--demonetisation and GST. Political observers feel that Banerjee is emerging as the alternative Opposition to Modi in the national political scenario.    And with that in mind, GST is set to be next battleground for the two. For Banerjee, it's her lieutenant, Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra who seems to be taking the GST war to Delhi.    A day before the GST council meeting, Mitra hinted that meeting the deadline of April, 2017 is a near impossible situation following the demonetisation.    ""The Centre should get their arithmetic correct. The investment in the country is anyway in bad shape. How the country will absorb the shock of such consecutive steps?""asked Mitra Significantly, Banerjee's Trinamool Congress is adamant on getting dual control, only for those , whose turnover is more than Rs 1.5 crore.    Trinamool Congress always thinks for the small and medium enterprises. How they would survive, if there is a dual control? And with these issues being unresolved, here comes the demonetisation. it is double whammy,"" he added. After the fifth GST council meeting, Mitra sounded even more disappointed.    ""This is the fifth time , the council failed to reach a consensus on dual control. It would be discussed again in the sixth meeting scheduled on December 11. Moreover, we are now finding many issues, that were not discussed earlier, "" Mitra told ET.",india,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-Mamata-Banerjee-asks-colleagues-to-raise-objections-over-GST-implementation/articleshow/55809425.cms,

The agency's probe till now, after it registered a criminal complaint under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on November 30, found that huge monies were transferred through RTGS transfers to some shell companies including a case where the Director of such a firm was a ""petty labourer.""    ""It was also found that directors of other shell companies were also persons of no means,"" the ED said in a statement.    The agency identified the two managers as Shobit Sinha and Vineet Gupta, working at Axis bank's Kashmere Gate branch here, and said they were arrested late yesterday under the provisions of PMLA. This is the first time such high ranking bank offciials have been arrested for alleged fraud transactions post the currency scrap.    They will be produced in a court today for further custody, they added.    Axis Bank said it has suspended the officials concerned.    ""The bank is committed to following the highest standards of corporate governance and has zero tolerance towards any deviation on the part of any of its employees from the set model code of conduct. In this particular case, the bank has suspended the erring employee and is cooperating with the investigating agencies,"" it said in a statement.    A gold bar, part of alleged kickbacks payment given to the bankers, has been seized by the agency from Sinha's location in Lucknow, ED said, adding another 2 kg of gold bars have also been seized from one of the jewellers involved in the racket.    The case was first detected by the Delhi Police after it intercepted three people with cash of about Rs 3.7 crore in old notes, in front of the said Axis Bank branch last month, and the ED took cognisance of the police FIR to slap money laundering charges against the accused.    The Income Tax department too had carried out its action in this case and had surveyed the bank branch and later searched the residential premises of the duo.    ED has notified the bank to ""stop operations"" in 11 accounts even as it has zeroed on a number of jewellers, entry operators and others in this case.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Demonetisation-ED-arrests-2-bank-managers-for-laundering/articleshow/55809783.cms,delhi

2016-12-05 15:20:00,Demonetization has helped Wajah Tum Ho get a solo release: Vishal Pandya,"Are you happy to be in Bengaluru?  Sana Khan (SK): I've been to Bengaluru and stayed here for quite a long time to shoot my Kannada film. I love Bengaluru, weather being a big reason. I enjoy coming here because the people are very warm and I can say this as I interacted with many local people during the shoot.    Sharman Joshi (SJ): I have fond memories of this city as I spent 35-odd days in IIM-B for the shoot of 3 idiots. Every day, after pack-up, we would end up playing some sport and hanging out with the students in the evening at their addas.    Gurmeet Choudhary (GC): This is my first time here.    Vishal Pandya (VP): I am happy to be here because I used to think that only Mumbai has bad traffic, but no, other cities suffer too!  Vishal, you have worked with Sharman before in Hate Story 3. What made you cast him again?  VP: Sharman is a fantastic actor and it would be a shame to make a film and not take him just because I don't want to repeat him. It is a treat for a director to work with him. I know that whatever role I give him, I am going to get a super performance.    SJ: Thank you! I was not sure what to expect from him when we started the shoot for Hate Story 3. But looks can be deceptive. You should have seen how this young guy took charge and command of the sets. As an actor, you get to know if a film is being shot well or not. And with Vishal, you know the shots are good. Also, he has a fine eye for acting. So, from an actor's perspective, he helps improve the performance.    I was quietly happy and surprised when Vishal offered me the role of a cop in Wajah Tum Ho because I always wanted to play one. I didn't show my happiness though, lest he take the role away from me. But he knew what he was doing and put his faith in me. So it has been a great association.    VP: I could sense his happiness even though he didn't say anything.  Gurmeet and Sana, with TV comes a set audience, but films are different. What were the challenges?  GC: The two mediums are very different. For TV, you have to work 365 days. Even if you don't like an actor initially, you start to after seeing him continuously for 50 days. In films, you don't get that chance; you have 70-80 scenes, and you have to connect from the first scene. So that much more work needs to go in. But I will always be grateful to the medium because I am doing films because of TV, which is also very big now. But I can't do daily soaps now as films take a lot of time.    SK: With films, it's very easy for people to judge whether you are a hit or flop with just one Friday. You can't go to their houses and show that you can improve. But in TV, you grow as an actor because you are working and improving each day. So, you become confident and camera-friendly. But films are much more exciting and you get to play different characters — characters that you always wanted to be when you were a kid. As a kid, I wanted to become a police officer, customs officer, doctor, air hostess and pilot.    VP: Your options are really good. I wanted to be an auto driver when I was a kid!    SK: Really? I really like people in uniform. There is so much power in a costume. So, I always wanted to do something in which I can don a uniform. This is why I was very happy when I got Wajah Tum Ho because I was playing a lawyer and not just a cute girl who is dating a guy and trying to be his emotional crutch and support his family. It is nice to play a strong girl who is not a bechari in the film. She is a very dominating character with leadership qualities. She listens to everyone, but does her own thing. I am way too excited because it is my first film. There is a lot to prove. There are lot of perceptions of me that I want to change with this film. I hope to do that in a positive way.  How was Sharman in the uniform?  SK: He is hot. I wish cops are as hot as Sharman. Even as a cop, he is very relatable. He has lot of humorous one-liners. All his dialogues are seeti-bajao dialogues.    This film is about cybercrime — a subject that isn't explored much in movies, even though most people have experienced it.    VP: That's what inspired us. I had this subject in mind for the last 6-7 years. I met many producers and actors, but they refused to back it. But when the first trailer came out, I received so many calls saying, 'Vishal, we made a mistake by not doing the film.' It's also a lesson for me on whom to approach whom not to.    Have any of you been subjected to cybercrime?    SK: Yes, my social media pages were hacked.    SJ: Not me, but some of my friends like Rahul Gandhi and Barack Obama have been having issues with it.    GC: The timing of the movie is perfect.  Has demonetization affected the release of the movie?  VP: Yes. It has affected everybody. That's the reason we have moved the release from December 2 to 16. Of course, it is for the betterment of society.    GC: But it is a good decision because now we have a solo release. What else could you want?    VP: Aur koi aata to bhi fark nahi padta. But Hate Story 2 clashed with Salman Khan's Kick, Hate Story 3 clashed with Shah Rukh Khan's Dilwale, so only Aamir was left and now we are almost clashing with him. It's OK. All the Khans are lucky for me.  Sana, is it tough to start from scratch in Bollywood when you have had a full career in the South?  SK: It is not from scratch. I was doing ad films in Mumbai, and from there I was approached for South films, and I ended up working in all four South industries for five years. Then, I was noticed for Bigg Boss, and the journey started again. So it's not about starting from scratch. I will always take up roles that appeal to me as an actor no matter what the language.  You have played Silk. But if there was a biopic now, who would you like to play?  SK: I would like to play Mother Teresa because I really like her. And maybe Sharman will play his friend Rahul Gandhi (laughs).    GC: I would like to play Bhagat Singh.  Sharman, have you modeled your cop role on anyone?  I have met many cops at different points of time in my life and their mannerisms are in my subconscious.

2016-12-06 05:47:00,Demonetization blues: UP government revenue collection dips 50%,"LUCKNOW: Demonetisation has not only affected the common man, it has also adversely hit the state's coffers. According to a report reaching the office of the chief secretary, in November this year, the total tax collection by UP government's various departments fell by nearly 50%. It was on November 8 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced ban on Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes.    Chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar told TOI on Monday that during a review meeting of various departments, it was revealed that the collection fell drastically for all of them barring the transport department. ""The average fall was around 50%,"" Bhatanagar said, adding ""the transport department's revenue went up because it was allowed to accept banned big denomination notes well after November 8.""    Bhatnagar said that the excise department could collect Rs 1,104 crore which is 75% of the target because the sale of countrymade liquor decreased after the demonetisation. According to an information given by principal secretary, stamp and registration, Anil Kumar, to the chief secretary office, since there was a sharp decline in the registration of properties after November 8, only Rs 550 crore could be collected against a target Rs 1,170 crore which is just 47%. Similarly, there was a 47% fall in the Mandi tax while in other departments also, the collection was not more than 50% of the target.    Bhatnagar said that as the people were still smarting under the impact note-ban, it would be difficult for the state to achieve the collection targets in the coming months. ""Since there is no proper penetration of banking network in the rural area, I have directed to popularise e-payment and make swipe machines available,"" Bhatnagar said.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Demonetization-blues-UP-govt-revenue-collection-dips-50/articleshow/55823197.cms,lucknow
2016-12-06 00:35:00,Spurt in violent robberies after demonetisation,"PUNE: Utter desperation for money in these days of cash crunch has led to a series of robberies in the city where the victims were also beaten up by the criminals.    Police officials said they have not seen such cases of violent robberies in the city limits before this period.    This turn of events after a five-day lull in house break-ins and chain snatching cases observed post-November 8 has rattled the Pune police. They have taken remedial measures and launched a massive hunt for the suspects involved in all the cases.    In all, 23 incidents of robbery like snatching gold chains, smartphones, cash and valuables were reported between November 14 and December 4. In at least 10 of the complaints there was also some violence like thrashing and beating up of the victims, threatening them with sharp weapons like a knife after offering them lifts and attacking them with sticks and stones.    The complaints were registered at Swargate, Bibvewadi, Bharati Vidyapeeth, Hinjewadi, Pimpri, Warje Malwadi and Hadapsar police stations. Three complaints were registered by the Hinjewadi police, while, Warje Malwadi police have registered two complaints and other police stations have registered one complaint each.    An analysis of all the cases has revealed that two, three or four robbers moved around in groups on motorbikes and cars and target their victims in isolated places.    ""We suspect the involvement of a particular gang for the violence in a series of robbery cases because they are in desperate need for money,"" joint commissioner of police Sunil Ramanand said on Saturday. ""We have issued instructions to all police stations and the crime branch to collect information of the gang also known as Baluchis to find out whether they have been released on bail in previous chain-snatching cases from the state's jails. We strongly suspect them because they indulge in violence if they are desperate for money,"" he told TOI.    He said there was a spurt in chain-snatching cases in 2015. ""We focussed our attention on habitual and repeated offenders and robbers released on bail from jails. In one of the cases, we have invoked the stringent provisions of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act on a gang of robbers after investigations revealed they were involved in violence and are members of an organized crime syndicate,"" Ramanand said.    They had also arrested a man for grabbing gold chains from 52 women and committing 22 vehicle thefts in Kondhwa and the neighbouring suburbs, he said.    The crime branch of the Pune police had arrested another man for allegedly snatching chains of 18 men and women involving violence in some cases. The series of arrests and detections had reduced robbery cases including chain snatching in 2016, Ramanand added.    He said that if a habitual offender is on the police radar, there are ways and means to control or neutralize his activities like taking preventive action after he is released from jail on bail.    ""If a person is a first-time offender, then there will be plethora of motives which will be ascertained only in the course of investigation,"" Ramanand added.    On the action taken in robbery cases, assistant commissioner of police (crime) Suresh Bhosale said, ""We are conducting raids at the residence of suspects involved in robbery cases in Pune, Thane and Ahmednagar districts. We are also raiding places where suspects involved in chain snatching reside in large numbers like Loni Kalbhor on the outskirts of Pune.""    The crime branch has a list of 150 criminals released on bail from various jails which has been circulated to officers for keeping a tab on their activities because some have indulged in violence while robbing their victims. The preventive action helps us in deterring them from committing new crimes, Bhosale added.

2016-12-06 07:27:00,Demonetisation hits tourism in HP,"SHIMLA: Demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes is going to have a severe impact on the estimated Rs 5,000-crore tourism industry of Himachal Pradesh, especially during winter season. With hotels having a low occupancy of 15% to 20%, those associated with the tourism industry are worried about their business as cash crunch is not allowing the people to visit hill stations of state. Earlier, honeymoon couples used to head for resorts in the state during winter, but they are missing this time.    Himachal Pradesh has around 2,400 registered hotels and guest houses with a bed capacity of around 62,000. It also has 630 restaurants and 500 registered home-stays. After summer season, yearend celebrations of Christmas and New Year, besides snowfall, attract hordes of tourists.    Upper Dharamshala Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association president Ashwani Bamba said hotels usually had an occupancy ranging from 40% to 50% in the areas of McLeodganj, Naddi, Bhagsunag and Dharamkot in December. ""However, after the note ban, occupancy has fallen to 15% to 20%,"" he said.    Bamba said travelling is a luxury and people visited tourist towns only if they had plenty of cash in hand to splurge. ""A majority of tourists spend in cash. The number of those opting for online transactions is very less. Cash crunch has severely affected tourism business. We fear this will continue for the next 3-4 months,"" he added.    Manali Hoteliers' Association president Gajender Thakur said occupancy of hotels in and around Manali had fallen below 20%. ""To attract tourists, we have started giving discounts. Because of this, occupancy has increased to around 30%. Still, only groups of students are coming to avail the discount benefits. Hopefully, occupancy will cross 50% once it snows in Manali and surrounding areas,"" he said.    Tourism Industry Stake Holders Association, Shimla, president M K Seth said tourism industry in Shimla demonetisation had only added to the worries of the struggling tourism industry of Shimla.

He added that the demonetisation scheme of the Centre was in national interest and would check black money while strengthening the economy.    While on demonetisation, even after installing facilities for bill payment, shopkeepers at Lucknow Mahotsava failed to get many customers and there was no hectic buying even on the last day. Speaking to TOI, visitors said they still feared any further other step to demonetise the present currency so they were avoiding to spend money on shopping and were spending only on food via a payment gateway.    The cultural activities related to the Mahotsava ended on Monday but the stalls will remain open till Wednesday.    In hope to meet their high sale targets, shopkeepers at Mahotsava installed swipe card machines for debit and credit card even their smartphones were seen loaded with the application to accept bill online. There are long queues in front of the ATMs on the mela premises. Thousands of people were seen visiting stalls of clothes, carpets, blankets, furniture, household items, kitchenware, eminent jewellery, toys and other products of beautification but instead of shopping, they only asked for the price and moved forward. Youths were also seen doing window shopping and preferred to head for the food junction.    According to district administration officials, out of 300 shopkeepers, 250 were offering facility to swipe card.    ""I sold eight carpets in the Mahotsava last year, but this year I have been able to sell only one so far,"" Farooq from Moradabad, who is offering facility to pay electronically.    Shopkeepers who were short on technical skills were also seen readily accepting bills online but people who were coming to enjoy the Lucknow Mahotsava preferred to save money rather than spend on buying items of their need.    ""I came with a plan to shop for kitchenware but when I reached the ground my purse didn't allow me and I told my husband we should save the money because we had suffered hardships caused by currency shortage,"" said Rakshanda Sahaye who was seen with her family at a food stall.    ""It's good to attend the Lucknow Mahotsava and administration has done a good job of organising the festival on time but I have not recovered from the demonetisation trauma, so I only bought two books and paid the bill via the app,"" said Paritosh Das Gupta.    ""It's a good idea to have installed the payment app but the shop I visited did not have the machine to swipe card and my husband had to stand in queue for payment as we got food worth Rs 850 and we ran short on cash,"" said Rashmi Sehgal, who was seen with her family at a Rajasthani food stall.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Batting-for-demonetisation-Naik-appeals-to-vote-good-govt-to-power/articleshow/55823349.cms,lucknow

Referring to PM's post-demonetisation speeches in Ghazipur and Agra, Mayawati said, ""After PM decided to go ahead with demonetisation, he ridiculed his opponents over how they would hold public rallies and fight elections. I want to tell the PM that there would be no adverse impact of demonetisation on BSP as we consider ourselves as a movement first and political party later.

""You have compelled everyone to become a fakir and 'kangaal' (penniless) by not fulfilling poll promises you made during 2014 Lok Sabha elections,"" Mayawati said, addressing a crowd that was reasonably large given the inclement weather.    ""Modi is feeling threatened and apprehends wipe-out in the Hindi heartland and to divert public attention he has resorted to demonetisation without any preparation,"" said Mayawati and alleged even 25% of the poll promises made by the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha polls were not fulfilled.

Immediately after his return from the United States, chief minister Raman Singh on Tuesday had a meeting with officials to review the situation arising out of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 and the progress of steps being taken to encourage cashless transactions and e-commerce in the state. Bankers, present at the meeting, informed that an amount of Rs 20, 160 crore in junked Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes had been deposited in the banks on November 8.

2016-12-07 06:12:00,"Between drought and Demonetisation: Give crop loans to farmers, RBI to banks","BENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stepped in to help farmers hit by the double whammy of severe drought and demonetization. The central bank asked banks to ensure cash availability for the current rabi crop season, and disburse crop loans to farmers on priority.    ""At a time when there is a cash crunch, we've taken note of the fact that some scheduled banks are selective in loan disbursal and are ignoring farmers,"" said a senior RBI official.    The RBI has particularly upped its ante over the fact that several banks maintaining currency chests are utilizing the available money to woo their own customers and not distributing notes equitably .    In an advisory on December 2, 2016, the RBI said: ""A perception has also emerged that banks with currency chests are according priority towards supplying cash to their own bank branches. These banks with currency chests are, therefore, advised to make visible efforts to dispel the perception of unequal allocation among other banks and their own branches.""    The main focus of the advisory is to nudge banks to help farmers. ""To ensure cash availability for the rabi crop season and adequate allocation of bank notes for rural branches, post offices and DCCBs, banks are advised to involve the district coordinators State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) in distribution of cash from currency chests,"" the notification said.    A reality check, however, reveals a different story: Farmers are not able to withdraw the required amount of money from their accounts, leave alone getting crop loans. Of the targeted Rs 18,000 crop loan for rabi, banks have disbursed over Rs 1,500 crore in October. No significant amount was released as crop loans after November 8, when Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes became obsolete.    ""While the government has failed to help mitigate the effect of drought, demonetization has only added to our misery . Normally , farmers bank on private moneylenders for loans. Due to demonetization, even moneylenders are of no use,"" said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Indian Sugarcane Farmers' Association.    Farmer leaders are now planning a widespread agitation. ""Various organizations, including the Raitha Sangha and Dalit Sangharsha Samithi will meet on December 10. We will chart out an agitation in protest against the indifference of both the Centre and state government,"" said KS Puttannaiah, Melkote MLA and leader of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha.    On its part, the SLBC is trying to prevail upon banks to comply with the RBI's advisory. ""We have convened meetings with banks after the RBI issued the advisory . They are willing to comply and efforts are on to ensure disbursal of crop loans before the end of the season,"" said SM Desai, deputy general manager of SLBC.    The initiative, however, seems to have helped little, with a severe shortage of cash supply . ""In addition to issuing an advisory, RBI should have released adequate cash too.When we placed an indent for Rs 400 crore ahead of pay day on December 1, we got only Rs 40 crore. How can banks comply with the RBI advisory when cash supply is not even 10% of the requirement?"" said a branch manager of State Bank of Mysore with a currency chest in Doddaballapur.    In a bid to mitigate the crisis, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) too has stepped in. ""We are calling upon stakeholders, including fertilizer dealers and seed suppliers, to accept payment by cheque or online. Banks disbursing crop loans may transfer cash directly into the accounts of dealers,"" said YV Rao, deputy general manager of Nabard.

The workers drew their wage twice a month -on 10th and on 25th. ""Our wages have nothing to do with demonetisation.

Interestingly , the jute mill never lost a man day in the last two and a half years.

Earlier, a worker said, incidents of lockout used to be reported from the Hanuman Jute Mill at least once in every five years.    ""It was one of the best jute mills in Bengal with 12,000 workers. Owner Mohan Jalan and his son Mahabir Jalan did their best for workers' welfare. The present owners are more interested in depriving workers to maximize their profits,"" said Ram Chandra Ram who had joined the mill in 1986. MLA Lakshmiratan Shukla said: ""I understand the workers' plight.I will speak to the management and take the issue to the chief minister so that it's resolved.""",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Wages-have-nothing-to-do-with-demonetisation/articleshow/55847402.cms,kolkata
2016-12-07 11:55:00,Modi has pushed country by decades: Shivpal on Demonetization,"BAREILLY: In a scathing attack on the Centre, Samajwadi Party's (SP) state president Shivpal Yadav dubbed the NDA government's demonetisation move as a dangerous step that has pushed the country back by decades. He said the economy will be adversely affected. ""The demonetisation decision was taken in haste on the whims of a few industrialists who are close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The salaried class, labourers and farmers have been hit alike, and the situation will not revive in the coming time though the Centre has assured that things will return to normal in 50 days,"" Shivpal said.    He said that demonetisation would be one of the important poll issue of the SP, considering its after-effects which would not let the situation come back to normal for months.""There are precedents that any country which has scrapped its currency had to suffer in the long run and only common people are suffer. We will prominently take the issue up in our rallies in the run up to the assembly elections.""    Shivpal was speaking on the eve of party's mega rally here on December 7, which will be attended by party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and other top leaders and office bearers of the party. This will be the second such rally of the 18 planned across the state, in a bid to intensify SP's poll campaign.    Reacting to the absence of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in the mega rally, Shivpal said, ""The work responsibilities during the campaign have been decided. All these rallies will be addressed by party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav."" Shivpal, however, refused to comment on his tussle with CM Akhilesh Yadav.    The stage is set for the mega rally at the Government Inter College grounds here. Apart from Mulayam, all the top leaders and cabinet ministers from the region have already arrived in the city.",city,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/Modi-has-pushed-country-by-decades-Shivpal-on-Demonetization/articleshow/55841206.cms,bareilly
2016-12-07 10:50:00,Demonetisation hits RWITC where it hurts the most,"MUMBAI: With demonetisation having severely hampered the smooth functioning of every sphere of life across the country, the sport of horse racing hasn't been spared either. And it certainly couldn't have come at a worse time for Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) which is already struggling to cope with high taxation, falling revenues and decreasing footfall.In fact, demonetisation has hit RWITC where it hurts the most, the betting collections. The Tote, the backbone of racing, has taken a severe hit. According to sources, the collections at Tote have gone down by almost 75 per cent. Even the decision to accept the plastic money has failed to revive it. Bookmakers, who had agreed to operate by just paying 35 per cent of the actual stall fees, are finding it difficult to sustain themselves. One leading bookmaker, on condition of anonymity, has predicted that demonetisation may kill racing soon. A high taxation rate of Rs 30 for every Rs 100 bet has already resulted in reduction in the number of bookmakers' stalls.RWITC has already slashed stakes money by half to owners for the first few days of current Mumbai Season. ""I am meeting the bookmakers of both Mumbai and Pune on Wednesday, along with Champaklal Zaveri, to plead for restoring the fees. Depending on the outcome, a decision will be taken on the stake money. I have spoken to owners' body, that we will have to continue with the interim stakes cut, till the committee meets both the owners' and trainers' committees on December 14 when this will be reviewed,"" Vivek Jain, chairman, RWITC, told TOI on Tuesday.While many connected with racing are predicting doom for the sport in Mumbai, the RWITC, which is currently headed by Jain, easily the best marketing man in Indian racing today, has not given up hope. ""We should never underestimate the positive spin off of a crisis. Some of our best work comes when we are in the midst of bad times. We need time to restore normalcy. The committee has been united in confronting these problems as one, and without any politics,"" Jain said.",sports,toi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/others/Demonetisation-hits-RWITC-where-it-hurts-the-most/articleshow/55848070.cms,

With this, the quantum of India's economy moving through the digital pipes will witness massive growth. Both Snapdeal and FreeCharge are committed to supporting all such initiatives.

Mukesh Butani, Managing Partner, BMR Legal: “An unprecedented, bold move leading charge from the front, the PM in the most secretively planned, seamlessly executed a move to root out unaccounted and counterfeit currency. A combination of national security concerns and wider agenda to filter out unaccounted income guided the Government to make this move. Figures of high denomination currency in circulation in past 5 years compared to growth in the economy pointed towards indicators of unaccounted money in circulation. Timing was perfect - a month after closure of the income disclosure week and a week after Diwali such that the impact of short term disruption in festive period is minimised.”

C.S. Ghosh, CEO and Founder, Bandhan Bank: The decision would cause problems to small traders and common public.

2016-11-09 23:38:00,"Currency demonetisation has precedence in India, elsewhere","India is not the only country to have opted for currency demonetisation. There are similar examples from other countries as well.
On demonetisation of higher denomination banknotes, the RBI said, “Rs.1,000 and Rs.10,000 banknotes, which were then in circulation were demonetised in January 1946. The higher denomination banknotes in Rs.1,000, Rs.5,000 and Rs.10,000 were reintroduced in the year 1954, and these banknotes were again demonetised in January 1978.”
Zimbabwe is another example, which went through hyper-inflation in 2008 following which its currency lost value. In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said the country had “adopted the multiple currency system or dollarisation in 2009 and it is therefore necessary to demonetise the Zimbabwe $ unit to replace it with the multiple currency system.” In Zimbabwe’s case, demonetisation was critical for policy consistency and for enhancing consumer and business confidence, its central bank had said.
In Singapore, though Japanese “Banana” notes had been in circulation during the Japanese occupation, after the Japanese surrendered, the note was demonetised in 1945, the ‘Singapore Mint’ said.
In Fiji, its Reserve Bank said, “demonetisation of the pounds and shillings was necessary as Fiji transitioned to the new decimal currency structure from January 13, 1969.” It added, “Due to limited quantities remaining in circulation, these notes and coins now have collectors’.”
The central bank of the Philippines, decided to demonetise the New Design Series banknotes issued on 12 June 1985, to “align with the practice of other central banks around the world which change the design of their currency that has been in circulation for over 10 years.”",Business,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Currency-demonetisation-has-precedence-in-India-elsewhere/article16274327.ece,NEW DELHI

The incidence of fake Indian currency notes of higher denomination has increased. For ordinary persons, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes, even though no security feature has been copied. The fake notes are used for anti-national and illegal activities. High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money. India remains a cash-based economy hence the circulation of fake Indian currency notes continues to be a menace. In order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money, the scheme has been introduced.

2016-11-09 20:37:00,Plea in SC seeks quashing of demonetisation decision,"A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking a judicial order quashing the government’s decision to “immediately discontinue” the circulation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes and give the poor a reasonable opportunity to organise their lives.
The writ petition filed by Supreme Court advocate Sangam Lal Pandey is likely to be mentioned for an early hearing.
The scrapping of the high-denomination currency was implemented from November 8-9 midnight after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government was constrained to take this measure to fight the black money menace.
Mr. Pandey’s petition terms the announcement a “Tughlaki Farman” — a term fashioned after the medieval Indian ruler Mohammed bin Tughlaq whose decisions to change the capital from Delhi and currency had boomeranged.
The petition sought to “quash this illegal and arbitrary announcement without giving any opportunity to the poor citizens of India.”

Alternative arrangements

It has asked the apex court to direct the government “to provide a stipulated time to citizens for making alternative arrangements for necessary activities, may it be medical, educational, weddings, farming, etc.”
Mr. Pandey, who is a party in person, claimed to have received information that several private hospitals have refused to take payment in cash. This may delay “serious operations,” he said.
He said thousands of weddings scheduled from November 9 to 11 might have to be cancelled.
“A large number of people are suffering,” the petition said.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Plea-in-SC-seeks-quashing-of-demonetisation-decision/article16440978.ece,New Delhi

2016-11-09 22:13:00,"Petty fights, long queues at petrol outlets mark day after demonetisation of notes"," Despite clarification from the Union government on the ways to encash currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denomination, many people appeared confused about the matter on Wednesday and got into petty quarrels with traders. Meanwhile, serpentine queues were seen in front of petrol stations in the districts of north and central Karnataka.
The most affected were the small businessmen, street vendors and the common man, many of whom were still not sure about what to do with the high-denomination notes in hand. Those who had heard about the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes wanted to dispose them of as early as possible.
In buses, for example, there were quarrels after commuters gave Rs. 500 notes to bus conductors for tickets costing below Rs. 100. Left with no option, a few conductors forced passengers to alight at the bus stations. At the weekly sante (bazaar) at Lingarajnagar in Hubballi, vegetable vendors and buyers got into altercations, and elders of the locality had to step in to resolve the arguments.
In cities and towns across north Karnataka, long queues were seen in front fo petrol bunks as both the high-denomination notes were accepted there. However, after obliging initially, many petrol station owners asked vehicle owners to either purchase fuel for Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 or pay in change. 
In Chitradurga, by afternoon petrol bunk owners were giving change only to those buying fuel for more than Rs. 300. Medical stores in hospitals were also full of people purchasing medicines for Rs. 25 or Rs. 50 just to get change.
In Vijayapura, petty shops and eateries witnessed dull business as people chose not to spend notes of lower denomination. And the case was no different in bigger shops that deal only in cash. 
However, many people felt that while they would be inconvenienced for a few days, the move would ultimately help in curbing black money.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Petty-fights-long-queues-at-petrol-outlets-mark-day-after-demonetisation-of-notes/article16274126.ece,HUBBALLI
2016-11-09 00:30:00,Demonetisation triggers panic," Panic was palpable on the streets across the State on Tuesday night following the sudden demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes with scores queueing up at ATM counters across the State and many who had immediate transaction needs or set out for long journeys finding themselves stranded without currency notes of lower denomination in their hands. 
With shopkeepers refusing to accept the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in their hands, many did not know what to do to meet their immediate needs. The shopkeepers themselves appeared confused about what they would do if they were to accept the currency notes though the transactions were legal. 
Those who waited before ATM counters were divided in their views about the measure, many terming it an unavoidable inconvenience in the larger interest of the nation, but a fairly large number viewing the measure uncalled for and the cause of a major worry for them.
State Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac came down heavily on the Central government’s decision, terming it “a mere drama” and a foolish act intended only to hoodwink the people. Black money, he said, is not hoarded in the form of currency and all that the government’s decision would do is to cause serious hardship to the people. Those without credit or debit cards would be really hit and worse would be the case of the State government’s financial transactions over the coming two days. “No economist whom I spoke to could see it as anything but a sham,” Dr. Isaac said.
However, State Planning Board member K.N. Harilal said though the measure would cause hardship to the people in the interim, it would help check spread of black money. “It is a positive move, though the dip in transactions could have short-term implications for the economy over the next two weeks. The public would also have to go through a difficult time in the transition phase. But in the long term it is bound to cleanse the economy,” he said, and added that the measure could also help to check inflationary pressure as cash in circulation comes down. 
Welcoming the government decision, former Planning Board member G. Vijayaraghavan said it was bound to result in increased use of plastic money in the short term. 
“While the lack of availability of lower denomination notes is bound to create problems for the public over the next few days, it has to be seen as a bold assault on black money,” he said. 
Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the demonetisation could also have an impact on the real estate sector as land prices crash. “It would probably be followed by the introduction of currency of higher denomination,” he said.",Kerala,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Demonetisation-triggers-panic/article16232030.ece,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM
2016-11-09 02:50:00,"Demonetisation of Rs. 500, Rs. 1000 notes: Naidu had inkling of the ban?","Did Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had an intuition of abolition of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes or was it a case of Prime Minister Narendra Modi heeding to his request?
Whatever it is, Mr. Naidu was among the first and few politicians who had been consistently demanding demonetisation of these two big currency notes to check black money and cleaning of electoral politics often dominated by distribution of these notes. He had even shot off a letter to Mr. Modi. With Mr. Modi’s big announcement on Tuesday night, Mr. Naidu’s stand appears vindicated.
Expectedly, Mr. Naidu lost no time in welcoming the decision of Mr. Modi. “The initiative will curb black money menace,” he said, while recalling the letter he had written to the Prime Minister on October 12 urging him to withdraw higher denomination of currency.
On October 12, Mr. Naidu was addressing his first press conference from his new office in Interim Government Complex at Velagapudi.
He became bit emotional and said unless these two big notes were banned, flow of black money and buying of votes could not be checked effectively.

S. S. Yuvaraj, vice chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Salem district, said that the people never expected such an announcement and it has shell shocked people belonging to all walks of life.
No doubt, all will face difficulties in the initial days. But everyone has to make some sacrifice in the interest of the nation, Mr. Yuvaraj said.

K. Mariappan, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Salem, said that the move will hit not only the trade and industry, but also the common man.
He said that the government would have done well by giving some time to the people to adjust themselves. The sudden closure of banks and ATMs will create unnecessary anxiety among the citizens. However, if the government has done it for protecting the interest of the country, the trade and industry will support it.
Meanwhile, on hearing the announcement, people swamped the ATMs situated in their respective localities in the late evening hours. They preferred to withdraw Rs. 400 at a time to ensure that they get currency of Rs. 100 denomination only. Soon, many of the ATMs in Salem city and other parts of the district went dry.

In West Delhi's Uttam Nagar, Amar Singh, a tempo cleaner, had no breakfast on Wednesday. ""I have Rs 9,000 in big notes, but just Rs 7 in loose change. I have just had tea, no breakfast. No one is willing to help me,"" he said.
Tara Devi, a labourer's wife in nearby Dabri, said she was illiterate and did not know what to do with her savings of Rs 3,000.
Her neighbour, Mahesh, borrowed Rs 200 from his employer to feed his family. ""I have already spent Rs 120. What will I do when my stock ends,"" he questioned.
Ghanshyam, a labourer in Janakpuri, said he has no identity proof or bank account. He was clueless about what he had to do with his Rs 2,000 life savings.
Shopkeepers said they were losing out on business. Yasin, a tomato seller in Okhla Mandi said no one was willing to offer him Rs 100 notes. ""My tomatoes are perishable items. I will be ruined,"" he said.
In Vikaspuri, H.R. Islam, a banana seller, said he had no customers despite being in business for two hours on Wednesday. ""Customers are visiting me with the only hope of getting change for their big currencies. I am not in a position to hel them,"" he said.
In Okhla wholesale market, a truck meant for supplies to the army mess, was stranded as no one was willing to accept the discarded notes.
At the city's metro stations, chaos reigned in the morning hours as commuters found themselves faced with notices announcing that Rs 500 and 1000 notes wod not be accepted for recharge.
However, the DMRC later came up with an announcement that these notes would be accepted at all metro stations till midnight of November 11.
Several shopkeepers, meanwhile, refused to oblige even their regular customers carrying the banned notes. ""If someone is willing to purchase vegetable worth Rs 450, I will accept their Rs 500 notes,"" said Balram, a vegetable vendor.
At Mother Dairy outlets, meanwhile, shopkeepers were not very obliging with their customers even though government rule requires them to accept the currency notes.
Some of these shopkeepers were willing to accept Rs 500 and 1000 notes only if customers purchased for the worth of the entire currency notes or if they bought quickly-perishable items.",Delhi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Demonetisation-Money-everywhere-but-no-takers/article16243653.ece,New Delhi

Party leader Botcha Satyanarayana said Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking the decision in the interest of curbing unaccounted for money was a welcome step. But, with huge number of 6.3 lakh villages and only 30,000 banks, doubts were being raised about the smooth transition. 
The Centre should take steps to ensure that daily wage earners and people in rural areas who were not exposed to banking transactions were not effected by the process.
Given the fact that rural areas were not fully prepared for banking, steps should be initiated to ensure that the option given by the Centre for exchanging money through banks and post offices progressed smoothly. 
Asked about AP Chief Minster N. Chandrababu Naidu was aware of the decision as was reported in a section of the press, he said such talk would lead to nowhere and the focus should only be on ushering in the best practices.",Hyderabad,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/YSRC-welcomes-decision-on-demonetisation/article16266788.ece,HYDERABAD

2016-11-09 21:58:00,Social media erupts in the hours after demonetisation ,"KOCHI: Social media had only one topic trending in the hours after the Centre announced the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes on Tuesday night as in one sweep, it upstaged the entire debate about the US presidential election. 
Soon after posts alerting to the declaration of demonetisation by the Prime Minister, a no-holds-barred social media spar of trolls between pro-Modi and anti-Modi camp followers erupted. This was interspersed with serious posts for and against the view that the move would check black money. 
But the most entertaining were posts and trolls by people who owed allegiance to neither camp but tried to find the funny side of a new dawn without the ‘big’ notes. One such troll made a mock request to Prime Minister Modi on behalf of Indian expats not to declare Indian passports invalid for travelling to India one fine midnight. 
There were plenty of trolls drawing link between demonetisation and the state of mind of political leaders. A former Chief Minister and his two Cabinet colleagues in the UDF government who are facing corruption charges were the pick of such trolls which said that they were yet to regain consciousness after collapsing on hearing the declaration. 
Another post featured a dialogue from the blockbuster movie Aaram Thampuran delivered by Mohanlal that there would come a time when bundles of notes would not even have the value of paper. 
An aggrieved troller felt the government was beating up the entire population for the crime committed by a few by withdrawing currency notes all of a sudden. As posts emerged from a pro-BJP camp that the new currency notes to be launched were to feature nano GPS, that became the theme of a flurry of trolls. 
One seemingly innocuous post with dollops of sarcasm wondered whether the GPS in currency notes could be leveraged for Wi-Fi connectivity. Another troll wanted to know whether those currency notes would have 13 mega pixel camera and such other features of a smart phone. 
Many posted images of wallets containing a few soiled Rs.10 notes and coins with the caption that it was one of those rare moments when being poor felt being good. 
Malayalees’ penchant for ‘spirited’ trolls came to the fore as there appeared ones which downplayed the information on places where the banned notes would be accepted with a query whether they would be accepted at Bevco outlets. “The most repeated question today is whether cards are accepted at Bevco outlets,” said another troll. 
As the day progressed and Donald Trump triumphed in the US Presidential election, demonetisation trolls gradually got replaced by more serious debates over the election results.

2016-11-09 20:14:00,Demonetisation spells confusion for Kochiites ,"KOCHI: The day’s trail to know the impact of the sudden demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes had just begun. 
Time was 10.48 a.m. on Wednesday. 
Sitting in his nondescript vegetable shop near the entrance to the normally bustling Kaloor market, Jamaal wore a confused look. 
Just a while ago a couple of his trusted clients had paid in Rs.500 notes on shopping. “They were regulars and could not be turned away unlike people who came in the guise of customers looking for change. The real impact will be known only by Thursday when suppliers return after today’s [Thursday] motor strike,” he said. 
At his abattoir a few metres away, Shiraas continued to accept ‘banned’ notes. “We have no black money to hide and therefore can change these notes at the bank. Business is already bad, and we can’t afford to turn our customers away citing the note issue,” he said. 
At Saritha theatre, hardly 4 km away, moviegoers had to check their wallets for Rs.100 or lower denomination notes. “No question of accepting bigger notes as they are no longer legal tender,” Sethunath, theatre manager, put it bluntly. 
There was a minor melee during the previous night’s second show. Alerted to the withdrawal of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, spectators started bombarding the canteen with the notes, Mathew, a ticket counter staff, recalled.
At his roadside kiosk near the theatre, Noufal sat idling away his time. With just three Rs.100 notes in his cash box, he could neither buy fresh stock nor do any business. He had to turn away quite a few customers who had come with banned notes. 
It was 11.22 a.m., and Benjamin looked around his deserted medical shop, which usually teems with customers. With the business having been hit, he had already started accepting cards for as low a purchase as Rs.10, while the minimum purchase through card swipe normally is Rs.200.
Anand, an employee at the Supplyco-run petrol pump near Durbar Hall Ground, expected more trouble as motorists streamed in. The lower denomination notes had literally exhausted, and customers were agitated over the failure of the outlet to tender balance. “We told them they could fill petrol for Rs.500 or Rs.1,000, but for anything less, we insisted that they give change,” he said. 
At just past 12 noon, the “note issue” dominated the chat between staff and passengers at the Ernakulam KSRTC depot. “Some depots had started exhibiting placards declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes were not accepted, though we haven’t done it as yet,” said station master Viswambaran. 
Conductors accepted banned notes as long as they had enough change to return balance and at times issued slips denoting that the balance be collected from depots later. But that was not possible on long routes, said Saji, a conductor. 
At Bevco’s self-serving premium outlet just a stone’s throw away beyond the A.L. Jacob flyover, employees had a leisurely day. With a board kept outside declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes and credit/debit cards were not accepted, sales were reduced to a trickle at the outlet, which usually logs a daily business of over Rs.10 lakh. 
“We mostly deal with notes of higher denomination since we sell premium brands. We are receiving inquiries asking whether such notes can be changed at our outlets,” said Nijesh, an employee.
Shiju had been operating the automatic ticket vending machine at the eastern entry of the south railway station for hours by the time the clock ticked past 12.30 p.m. He held the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in one hand as if they were a testimony to his helplessness. 
“Passengers can either wait till enough change is collected to get the balance on buying tickets, or they can give change,” he said and passengers seem convinced. 
But it was a different story at ticket counters at the main entrance where heated arguments became the order of the day even as some agitated passengers threatened to lay siege to counters.

2016-11-09 23:28:00,Demonetisation: Here's how you should exchange your cash,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement to demonetise Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes currently in use has caused a panic among the public. Here is an explainer from the RBI on what is all about.

Why is this scheme introduced?

The incidence of fake Indian currency notes of higher denomination has increased. For ordinary persons, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes, even though no security feature has been copied. The fake notes are used for anti-national and illegal activities. High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money. India remains a cash-based economy hence the circulation of fake Indian currency notes continues to be a menace. In order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money, the scheme has been introduced.

How much value will I get?

Personal visit to the branch is preferable. In case it is not possible for you to visit the branch you may send your representative with an express mandate i.e. a written authorisation. The representative should produce authority letter and his / her valid identity proof while tendering the notes.

2016-11-09 19:28:00,Demonetisation effect: Business transactions hit in Vijayawada,"The transition from old currency notes of Rs.1000 and Rs.500 denomination to new and more secure Rs.500 and Rs.2000 notes had a tell-tale impact on businesses across Vijayawada, right from the early hours of Wednesday.
People had to withhold household cash transactions and even drop travel plans due to the short supply of Rs.100 and currency notes of smaller value that are to be exchanged for the existing series of Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes.
Cash registers at the railway reservation counters were ringing as usual but only to the extent the public tendered notes of Rs.100 and smaller denomination as the availability of small notes was a conspicuous problem here.
The passengers were, however, unwilling to buy the railway staff’s ‘we-dont-have-change’ answer. Some of them had to run around for petty cash but to no avail.
Similar scenes were witnessed at Pandit Nehru Bus Station and also during the travel in APSTRC buses. Serpentine queues were seen at toll plazas on the National Highways since dawn with the staff not accepting the banned currency. The problem was eased only after the Centre announced lifting of toll tax till November 11.
""The situation was bad at ticket-issuing counters as the staff insisted for Rs.100 and Rs.50 notes. Even at hotels and tea stalls on platforms, the demonetized notes were rejected, putting the passengers to a lot of trouble"", said Ram Naik, a railway commuter from Madhya Pradesh.
At the Gannavaram airport, there was not much problem as there were only a small number of the air passengers who purchased tickets across the counters. On the other side, auto-rickshaw drivers were reluctant to accept the high-value notes from passengers.
""The auto-drivers were initially enquiring about the availability of Rs.100 and Rs.50 notes, otherwise they were not providing their service from the airport. The government should have taken proper measures for the exchange of small notes before taking its decision"", opined a passenger at the airport.
The only places which were thronged by the public in large numbers were petrol bunks, where the phased-out currency notes were accepted. However, the paucity of smaller notes disrupted the business badly.
It was a smooth going in hospitals which were mandated to accept the Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes. Gold sale and purchase was stalled due to cancellation of the big notes and no customers were seen in these showrooms.
Asked whether public can deposit Rs. 1000 and Rs.500 in post offices from Thursday, staff at Gandhinagar Post Office here said they can exchange notes once the Reserve Bank of India distributes new currency to post offices.
Notwithstanding the teething problems posed by the new currency regime, there was, by and large, a consensus that it was a welcome decision by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the rider that more time should have been given for exchanging the ‘demonetised’ notes.",Vijayawada,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/Demonetisation-effect-Business-transactions-hit-in-Vijayawada/article16440972.ece,VIJAYAWADA
2016-11-09 20:50:00,Demonetisation causes cash famine in Malabar ," Business was in low gear across the north Kerala region on Wednesday as merchants and traders tried to make sense of the demonetisation and shoppers and customers struggled hard to cope with the shortage of legal-tender money with them.
People woke up to the reality that most of the cash they had with them were of no use immediately. Towns and cities in the region soon realised that they were in the grip of a financial famine.
Kozhikode, the hub of Malabar’s trade, was under a partial commercial paralysis as the banks were shuttered, ATMs were closed and people had no money to pay for their transactions. S.M. Street in Kozhikode, the largest retail shopping centre in the entire Malabar, reflected the gloom. The area, usually bursting at the seams with shoppers, was not crowded on Wednesday. Businesses reported that sales were down to less than a half as they could not accept Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. There was a heavy decline in the wedding-related purchases which are referred to as ‘marriage shopping.’ As the banks and ATMs were closed, the customers were not able to take out cash to pay for high-volume purchases.
However, larger shops in S.M. Street and the upmarket ones across the city that accept credit and debit cards said there was an increase in business using the cards.
Reports from Kannur, Kasaragod, Vadakara, Kanjangad, Kalpetta and many other towns indicated a marked decline in business. In the eastern upland areas, sale and purchase of agricultural products were heavily hit. A natural-rubber trader at Thiruvambadi in Kozhikode district said that he had withdrawn Rs.2 lakh, all in 500s, from his bank last evening. But, since the cash was of no use on Wednesday morning, he opted not to open his shop.
Land-deal registrations across the region was crippled as the parties could not pay the registration fee and related expenses to the government in cash. For instance, at a sub-registrar office (SRO) in Kozhikode city, none of the nine registrations scheduled did not take place. A document writer told The Hindu that his client had got around Rs.5 lakh ready in 500s and 1,000s on Tuesday itself to be paid as stamp duty and registration fee. However, registration of wills and partition deeds were done as the expenses were small.
Some restaurants in the city had to close in the afternoon as their customers could not pay up in small-denomination notes. Petrol pumps, which were allowed to accept the demonetised notes, however, supplied fuel for Rs.500 or its multiples.",Kozhikode,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/Demonetisation-causes-cash-famine-in-Malabar/article16273654.ece,KOZHIKODE
2016-11-09 20:58:00,"Farmers, street vendors most hit by demonetisation","In markets in the city, street hawkers and eatery owners looked tired of answering the question, ""Do you have change for Rs. 500?""
Business was dull at major markets in the city. Ayaan, a shoe shop seller from Commercial Street, said, ""What about the small street vendors who don't have bank accounts? They will need to open an account, clear income tax forms to get money now, it's just not sensible.""
However although most shopkeepers looked down that business was poor, they felt it was a good move in the long run. At Russell Market, hoteliers saw low business and some refused people who came with Rs. 500 bills.
Farmers hit most
Farmers who have supplied foodgrains and vegetables to wholesale markets, but crippled to take a cheque or bank payments, are the most hit by the currency demonetisation. Most of such farmers have now got credit bills from traders. However, they may have to wait for a long time before their credit bills are settled in cash, as there is a withdrawal limit from banks at Rs. 20,000 a week.
Farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, said that only the large land holders would have bank accounts and such sudden demonetisation and bank withdrawal limits, push the small farmers already suffering from failed crops to the wall. ""We demand that the withdrawal limits be relaxed so that the farmers are paid in earnest,"" he said.
A day's loss too heavy for them
For the vendors who live on the streets, even a one day loss of sales could mean going to sleep on an empty stomach. Sixty five year old Kamalamma selling outside Bangalore Fort was almost in tears as she looked at her wilted greens. ""I have not made one sale the whole day,"" she said. She has no family of her own and doesn't have a bank account. Those selling non-essential items like knick knacks and combs were worst hit, with people unwilling to shell out change for such items. ""No one has change to buy my wigs, they have been made with hair from Tirupati,"" said Vasantha, who sells wigs near the fort.
All dues paid
In a decoration shop in KR Market, four men sit on the floor with bags filled with cash. ""These boys work for my brother who has a hardware shop. Usually when they go to collect dues they get around Rs. 5000 in dues from each customer, today people have paid as much as Rs. 50,000,"" said Ramesh Kumar.
At the generic medicine store in Victoria Hospital, Rs. 500 bills were being accepted for payments more than Rs. 300. Hospitals were accepting demonitised bills as they have been instructed by the government to do so.",Bengaluru,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/Farmers-street-vendors-most-hit-by-demonetisation/article16273696.ece,Bengaluru
2016-11-09 19:47:00,Demonetisation triggers panic," There was unprecedented rush and chaos witnessed at several major petrol bunks in the city from the early hours of Wednesday, following the Central government’s announcement on Tuesday night of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. This triggered a panic reaction among people, who thronged petrol bunks that were one of the few places which the Central government had announced can accept the demonetised currencies. While some of the petrol bunks accepted the currency notes, a few of the smaller ones turned away customers or reportedly remained non-operational. Petrol bunks have been instructed to take these currencies until November 11.
Many felt it was too short a notice for the common man to make arrangements for their daily needs. What added to panic was the announcement that banks will remain closed on Wednesday and ATMs for the next two days. “We were caught unaware. Most of us have to step out early in the morning for work and adding to the problems, there was hardly any petrol left in my vehicle. I had to stand in long queues for more than an hour to fill petrol,” said V. Sandeep, an IT professional.
At places like Siripuram, serpentine queues trickled on to the Andhra University main road in the morning. Many people came together to pool in the bills and filled petrol as none of the petrol bunks were giving change of Rs 100 currency note, which turned into a hot commodity. I. Padmavathi, a resident of Kancharapalem, came with four others to fill petrol at the bunk near IV Town Police Station. “My vehicle tank is small. So we could give a Rs 500 note by sharing petrol among five people,” she added. At some petrol bunks, agitated commuters were seen involved in heated arguments with the staff who refused to accept the currency notes. With the demand for Rs 100 notes suddenly escalating, some petrol bunk salesmen who accepted Rs 500 currency note for filling petrol for Rs 400 were seen returning Rs 90, pocketing the additional Rs 10. 
Meanwhile, many senior citizens were in a state of panic. V. Shanti Latha, a resident of Pandurangapuram, woke up to the news of demonetisation of the currency notes with no lower denomination notes left with her to buy the daily groceries. “My son and daughter-in-law had to go to Hyderabad on a short tour so I was left with no help. I do not know how to operate the internet nor do I have a debit card,” said the 75-year-old. Fortunately, her neighbour came to her help and ordered from an e-commerce grocery store for the next two days supplies. Some others like T. Sujatha (65) were turned away from Apollo Medicals when she gave a note of Rs 1,000 to purchase her diabetes medicines. 
However, the general opinion of the public on PM’s sensational move was positive. “For a nation attempting to battle corruption, two days of financial inconvenience is not much of a collateral,” said P. Surya, PSU employee. ",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Demonetisation-triggers-panic/article16273380.ece,VISAKHAPATNAM

It was a smooth going in hospitals which were mandated to accept the Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes. Gold sale and purchase was stalled due to cancellation of the big notes and no customers were seen in these showrooms.
Asked whether public can deposit Rs. 1000 and Rs.500 in post offices from Thursday, staff at Gandhinagar Post Office here said they can exchange notes once the Reserve Bank of India distributes new currency to post offices.
Notwithstanding the teething problems posed by the new currency regime, there was, by and large, a consensus that it was a welcome decision by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the rider that more time should have been given for exchanging the ‘demonetised’ notes.",Vijayawada,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/Demonetisation-effect-Business-transactions-hit-in-Vijayawada/article16273262.ece,VIJAYAWADA
2016-11-10 14:13:00,‘India’s demonetisation move bold but implementation is key’,"Hailing the Indian government’s decision of demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes, the U.S. experts have said the success of this radical anti-corruption step would depend on its implementation.
“This is a surprising and radical policy to get at the core of one of India’s problem corruption,” Puneet Manchanda, professor of marketing at the Ross School of Business, said.
“The positives are that it signals clear intent and action to minimise corruption. The negatives are that it targets low and mid-level corruption, it is less likely that large-level corruption is heavy on cash,” he said.
Markets such as real estate are likely to be slowed due to the lack of liquidity. Thus, it is hard to predict the short term effect, but it can only help in the medium term, he said.
“In order to make this policy maximally effective, the government should continue to roll out other policies to fuel the fight against corruption,” Manchanda said.
Vikramaditya Khanna, professor at University of Michigan Law School, said “How effective this measure will be in addressing corruption and unaccounted for money will depend in part on whether the most likely methods of evading it are being policed effectively. Time will only tell but it is a bold move to address a problem plaguing India for many years“.
M S Krishnan, associate dean of global initiatives at the Ross School of Business, described this as an excellent move from Indian Government and said, “It will address many challenges they face such as unaccounted black money, corruption and fake currency“.
“Over the last several months, government did offer opportunities for citizens to declare their wealth, so it was in the making. In the long run this will make it much easier and cleaner to do business in India,” Krishnan said.
Reacting to the Indian government’s step, the Obama administration described this as an anti-corruption move.
“It is an anti-corruption measure taken by the Modi government following a series of steps that the government has taken in the past years in an attempt to reduce counterfeit money or black money,” State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner told reporters on Wednesday.

2016-11-10 00:14:00,"U.S. poll result, demonetisation hit stocks"," The Indian stock market fell about 1,700 points during the morning session on Wednesday, mirroring a global trend, before staging a recovery on the back of banking and pharmaceutical stocks
The victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential polls led to a global sell off on concerns of possible trade barriers. The demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in India also acted as a catalyst.
The benchmark Sensex lost 1,688.69 points during the pre-open session to touch a low of 25,902.45. Later in the day, it recovered partially to close at 27,252.53, down 338.61 points or 1.23 per cent. The broader Nifty lost 111.55 points or 1.31 per cent to close at 8,432.
During the early morning massive sell-off in the Indian market was part of global negative sentiment with the Dow Jones futures shedding more than 600 points and the leading Asian indices like Hang Seng and Nikkei losing 494 points and 920 points, respectively.
“The U.S. presidential elections took the markets by surprise,” said Kamlesh Rao, chief executive officer, Kotak Securities. “The markets initially went into some tailspin as there have been previous concerns about possible trade barriers with other nations.” 
“Volumes may see a dip in the near future especially from the retail investors. However, the HNI (high net worth individual) and institutional volumes may not be impacted significantly. The volumes will pick up over medium term to long term,” added Mr. Rao.
The technology sector bore the maximum brunt as Mr. Trump has already mentioned about his reservations on the H1-B visa programme under which Indian software engineers go to the U.S. 
TCS was the worst performer in the Sensex pack, shedding 4.93 per cent to close at Rs.2,171.05. Infosys also lost 2.74 per cent to close at Rs.955.85.
Realty was another sector that lost ground owing to the government’s sudden crackdown on black money.
The BSE Realty index lost 10.23 per cent while sector heavyweights like Indiabulls Real Estate, DLF, HDIL and Oberoi Realty all losing in the range of 10-20 per cent each.
“The banning of large denomination currency may be a bit painful in the shorter term but definitely better for long-term in terms of better tax compliance, control on corruption as well as inflation,” said Motilal Oswal,chairman and managing director, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
A total of 2,157 stocks lost ground on BSE, with only 610 gainers.
Banking stocks, however, managed to buck the trend with State Bank of India gaining 2.83 per cent while Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank moving up over one per cent each.
Despite a weak opening, the rupee ended stronger as compared to the dollar as the central bank intervened in the currency market. The rupee ended the day at 66.44 against the dollar as compared to its previous close of 66.42 per dollar. The rupee opened at 66.79 per dollar and went on to touch 66.93 before recovering.
“State-run banks were selling dollars on behalf of the central bank. The recovery of the stock market also helped the currency,” said a currency dealer.
Bonds also gained as demonetisation of currency is expected to cool inflationary pressures.

2016-11-10 00:05:00,Indian 'jugaad' to beat rupee demonetisation,"When push comes to shove, one turns an innovator. Or how else could one view the creative ingenuity of these people.
Though Centre declared that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 would not be legal tender any more from midnight on Wednesday, it left some time-window. Cashing in on this, Hotel Saravana Bhavan, a chain of hotels head-quartered in Chennai, having 36 branches across the state, has opted to accept Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes from its customer. 
The hotel’s creative in-charge K. Kamalakannan, said: “We are accepting the notes. We will exchange them when the banks open doors,’’ he said.
There is an hitch, however. Tendering change has proved a big challenge for the hotel. 
Couple of its customers hit upon an interesting solution for this predicament. Though they are unknown to each other, they chose to share their bills. One of them paid the combined bill, and the other promised him to do an online recharge of his portion! 
Using credit card to pay your coffee bill! Not an Indian practice. And, certainly unheard of in Chennai. Have coffee at a Sangeetha restaurant in city and settle your bill through credit card. A small amount but a significant giant movement towards cashless society! 
C. Sivasankaran-promoted nascent taxi hailing company UTOO Customer said it would accept Rs.500 notes but won’t tender change. Instead, it said it would give a credit note, which a customer could use for another trip! “To ease your travel, we will accept account payee cheques as mode of payments,’’ it said. 
Even an IOU (I owe you) letter will do, said Mr. Sivasankaran. Tata to an old order, hail the new change!
Well, this bank has decided to reward anybody who embraces change. Indusind Bank said it would offer 2X reward points to its customers who use credit cards to transact. A well-designed change story, a rewarding one at that!

2016-11-10 03:28:00,‘Demonetisation will hit terror financing hard’,"The government has said one of the reasons to demonetise notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 was to curb the circulation of fake currency, but there seems to be no definite account of the amount of such notes in circulation.
As per a study done by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2015, the only concrete work done on the subject, at any given point of time Rs. 400 crore worth fake notes were in circulation in the economy. This is merely 0.025 per cent of the total budget outlay of Rs. 19.7 lakh crore as announced this fiscal.
Different agencies have their own estimates based on the recoveries made by them.
According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2015, various law enforcement agencies seized 1,78,022 pieces of fake Rs 1,000 notes. This means Rs 17 crore fake notes, which were in circulation could be calculated as they could be seized. Similarly, in 2015, as many as 2,99,524 pieces of Rs. 500 fake notes were seized.

Spread of counterfeits

The Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata study, done on behalf of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), said that Rs. 70 crore fake notes were pumped into the economy every year.
Officials in the security establishment were upbeat about the demonetisation scheme as they expect that crimes like terror financing would be severely hit by the move.

Cases registered

 “The fake notes can be detected only when they enter the banking system. If it is in circulation in the open market, then it’s hard to calculate the number. In the past two years, we registered 25 cases of fake notes and 26 persons were convicted in three cases and the remaining cases are still on trial,” said Alok Mittal, Inspector General, NIA.
Another official said that in 90 per cent of the cases, fake currency was pumped in through the land route from Bangladesh. “The fake notes are manufactured in Pakistan and they reach Bangladesh through air and sea route. An organised group then pushes the money into India through the porous border areas,” said the official.

Security features

 On being asked how the yet to be launched Rs. 2,000 notes would be deterrent to the resurgence of the fake currency notes, an official said, “It is difficult to say and we can only assume that Pakistan or the elements involved in it would not be able to compromise the security features. It is true that certain security features of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had been compromised. The supplier of raw currency, the ink and the silver thread is same for India and Pakistan and we have been asking countries like the U.K, the U.S. and Germany, where these are manufactured to stop the sale to Pakistan.”
D.C Pathak, former Intelligence Bureau chief, said, “While removing black money, the process it [demonetisation] will definitely address the problem areas of terror financing and fake currency. There is illegal money behind terrorist funding. The channel through which the adversary sends in militants and arms is also used to send fake currency.”
An official said the demonetisation would impact the terror financing, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorist outfits like Hizb-ul-Mujahideen collect donations in Pakistan and then route the money into the State through hawala operators. “The terror funding module in place right now, will be affected as the terrorist operatives always store money in the form of big currency notes.

While ATMs downed their shutters in tune with the government order, there were huge crowds at all places that witness large scale cash transactions such as toll gates, railway station, central bus station and fuel stations. While petrol bunks accepted ₹ 500 and ₹1,000 notes, though after initial resistance, they could not generate enough change to return. As a result, they insisted on filling up tanks for the entire denomination, which resulted in friction at half a dozen locations.Pilgrims visiting the temple city from far-off places also woke up to the news and had to face hardship. “We welcome the decision, but it should have been planned and announced after careful thought so as to avoid such inconvenience to the pilgrims and the middle class population,” said social activist P.

2016-11-10 00:45:00,Rajnath Singh justifies ‘historic’ demonetisation in Ballia,": Hailing it as a “surgical strike” on black money, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said that through his “historical” decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had dealt a big blow to terrorism.
The home minister claimed that Mr. Modi has “taken away the strength” of terrorists and Pakistan, which he alleged had supplied fake currency notes to foster terrorism in India. “Fake currency was being printed in Pakistan and was then sent to India to destroy its economy. Such were Pakistan’s attempts...In India, fake currency was helping terrorists...it gives big strength to terrorists and Pakistan. By scrapping Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Narendra Modiji has taken away that strength,” Mr. Singh said.
Addressing a ‘Parivartan Rally’ in Ballia on the eastern fringes of U.P., the minister also spoke about the U.S. presidential results, linking president-elect Donald Trump to Mr. Modi. “How did Mr.Trump fight his election? Mr. Trump said that if he became president of the U.S., he would follow and work according to Narendra Modi’s policies. That Trump has won in America, brothers and sisters,” Mr. Singh said, adding that after the Modi government came to power at the Centre, India had increased its global standing and become the fastest growing economy in the world. To introduce Mr. Trump to the eastern U.P. crowd, Mr. Singh had to resort to some familiarising: “On one side was Ms. Clinton and the other, Mr. Trump, the trump card...not the trump card in the game of cards...Mr. Trump.”
At the rally attended by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and ministers, including Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Singh, Om Mathur, and Yogi Adityanath, the party made efforts to justify Mr. Modi’s decision to demonetise currency in the wake of the disruption of normal life and services. 
Mr. Singh said the decision had paved the way for making India a “global economic superpower”, even as he appealed to the people to bear the temporary inconvenience due to the shift in currency as it would push India towards becoming a global economic superpower. 
“I am sure it must be causing inconvenience to some people for some time. But I want to assure you on the basis of what I know of economics, the step may cause inconvenience for a short period to some people but nobody can stop India from becoming the most powerful global economic force...it is such an important step,” Mr. Singh said in a speech in Hindi laced with the regional Bhojpuri. BJP State president Keshav Prasad Maurya termed it “bitter medicine” necessary to remove the “illness” of corruption “from its roots”.
The former U.P. chief minister also raked up the surgical strikes by the army, saying it had sent a strong message nationally and internationally. “We can kill here and even there [across the Line of Control], if needed. We have shown it,” he said. The minister also asked the crowd to raise their hands in the air to laud the army’s efforts, even as he recalled the role of Ballia, one of U.P.’s most backward districts, in the Independence movement. 
He also promised to abolish interviews while recruiting police personnel, saying this would end corruption in the process. Urging voters to elect a BJP government in UP, Mr. Singh said that under his party’s rule, no goon would be allowed to walk free in the State. While the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) has maintained a studied silence on the demonetisation issue so far, the BJP is out to project that it will hamper the BSP’s prospects in the 2017 elections. “Will Mayawati get sleep after it? Will corrupt officials get sleep?” Mr. Maurya asked.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Rajnath-Singh-justifies-%E2%80%98historic%E2%80%99-demonetisation-in-Ballia/article16274838.ece,LUCKNOW
2016-11-10 00:00:00,Demonetisation: Lack of information leads to chaos,"As expected, the sudden announcement on demonetisation caused initial hiccups and a chaotic situation prevailed in the city on Wednesday.
While ATMs downed their shutters in tune with the government order, there were huge crowds at all places that witness large scale cash transactions such as toll gates, railway station, central bus station and fuel stations. While petrol bunks accepted Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, though after initial resistance, they could not generate enough change to return. As a result, they insisted on filling up tanks for the entire denomination, which resulted in friction at half a dozen locations.Pilgrims visiting the temple city from far-off places also woke up to the news and had to face hardship. “We welcome the decision, but it should have been planned and announced after careful thought so as to avoid such inconvenience to the pilgrims and the middle class population,” said social activist P. Naveenkumar Reddy, who staged a demonstration at the Rajiv Gandhi Circle by displaying the demonetised notes.
Meanwhile, SP R.Jayalakshmi held a meeting with bankers and offered to arrange security in the branches going to witness heavy queues. BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanprakash Reddy welcomed the decision as ‘historic.’",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-Lack-of-information-leads-to-chaos/article16441577.ece,TIRUPATI
2016-11-10 00:00:00,"Petty fights, long queues at petrol outlets mark day after demonetisation of notes","Despite clarification from the Union government on the ways to encash currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denomination, many people appeared confused about the matter on Wednesday and got into petty quarrels with traders. Meanwhile, serpentine queues were seen in front of petrol stations in the districts of north and central Karnataka.
The most affected were the small businessmen, street vendors and the common man, many of whom were still not sure about what to do with the high-denomination notes in hand. Those who had heard about the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes wanted to dispose them of as early as possible.
In buses, for example, there were quarrels after commuters gave Rs. 500 notes to bus conductors for tickets costing below Rs. 100. Left with no option, a few conductors forced passengers to alight at the bus stations. At the weekly sante (bazaar) at Lingarajnagar in Hubballi, vegetable vendors and buyers got into altercations, and elders of the locality had to step in to resolve the arguments.

Seeking change

In cities and towns across north Karnataka, long queues were seen in front fo petrol bunks as both the high-denomination notes were accepted there. However, after obliging initially, many petrol station owners asked vehicle owners to either purchase fuel for Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 or pay in change.
In Chitradurga, by afternoon petrol bunk owners were giving change only to those buying fuel for more than Rs. 300. Medical stores in hospitals were also full of people purchasing medicines for Rs. 25 or Rs. 50 just to get change.
However, many people felt that while they would be inconvenienced for a few days, the move would ultimately help in curbing black money.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Petty-fights-long-queues-at-petrol-outlets-mark-day-after-demonetisation-of-notes/article16441380.ece,HUBBALLI
2016-11-10 00:00:00,Trade hit in Kollam post-demonetisation,"With the demonetisation of the higher denomination currency notes coming into effect from Tuesday night, most trading activities in the district was badly hit on Wednesday.
Though people had cash with them, a bankruptcy situation prevailed because there was not much cash with people in the lower denomination notes.
In spite of the ban, the withdrawn higher denomination notes continued to be accepted at the auction halls of fishing harbours in Kollam on Tuesday morning. Fishermen said fish being a highly perishable commodity they had no other go but to accept the higher denomination currency notes in the hope of getting them exchanged at banks.
Most jewellery shops in the district remained closed. The gold rate for the day that is declared by 9.45 a.m. on all working days was declared only after 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday.
At shops that remained open business was dull. Due to shortage of cash in the legally accepted denominations with jewellers, purchase of old jewellery was almost nil, traders said.
In the morning as rumours got sparked off that liquor outlets would accept the withdrawn currency notes on Tuesday, it led to outlets getting virtually mobbed before these could open.
But after opening, the expectations of the crowd got belied as notices were prominently put up that read that the withdrawn denomination currency notes would not be accepted.
Business at Bevco outlets was dull on Tuesday.

'Pay only full amount'

While it was notified that fuel pumps would accept the withdrawn higher denominations, the pump operators insisted that customers purchase fuel for the entire amount, if cash was given in the Rs.500 or Rs.1,000 denominations. Their excuse was that they don’t have change in the lower denominations. This led to a chaos-like situation and by afternoon most pump operators kept their outlets closed for the rest of the day.
At supermarkets, cash business dipped but there was upswing of trade through credit and debit cards. Some of the supermarkets insisted that customers giving notes in the Rs.500 or Rs.1,000 denomination should mandatorily purchase for Rs.470 or Rs.930 respectively. Shops dealing in building materials and other items did most of their trade by accepting account payee cheques..",Kerala,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Trade-hit-in-Kollam-post-demonetisation/article16441671.ece,KOLLAM
2016-11-10 00:00:00,"Post-demonetisation, arecanut prices slump","The price of arecanut at Shivamogga Agriculture Produces Marketing Committee (APMC) Market has slumped by around 10 per cent following the announcement by the Union government to demonetise Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency .
The price of ‘hosa rashi’ variety of arecanut, that was traded at Rs. 29,250 on Tuesday, declined to Rs. 26,400 on Wednesday.
There was a decline by around 10 per cent in the price of ‘hale rashi,’ ‘gorabalu,’ ‘bette’ and ‘saraku’ varieties also.
D.M. Shankarappa, president of the Shivamogga District Chamber of Commerce and Industries and an arecanut merchant, told The Hindu that as an outfall of the announcement to demonetise the currency, there was confusion regarding payments at multiple levels, including the firms engaged in making products from arecanut and the owners of local mandis.
“Many small and marginal farmers insist payment in liquid cash ... but the banks were closed today. Even the flow of produce to the market was less on Wednesday.
A sense of uncertainty gripped the market and the quantum of trading was not on expected level,” he said.
Mr. Shankarappa said that the slump in price was a temporary phenomenon. Another four to five days is required for the recovery of the prices, he added.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Post-demonetisation-arecanut-prices-slump/article16441337.ece,Shivamogga

For most part of Wednesday, there was sparse traffic on the city roads suggesting that there was less or no business conducted at every level. The usually bustling Abids, Banjara Hills, Madhapur, Begumpet, Secunderabad and old city wore a dull look with many shops either partially shut or displaying posters which read that the banned currency would not be accepted.
Since many ATMs and Banks were closed, many uninformed persons landed at post offices to exchange out-of-use notes. Since the post offices were ordered to suspend transactions of all kinds for a day, those who had come to convert the demonetised notes to lower and legal denominations were also disappointed.
“Many of our customers stood outside office as they wanted to buy stamps or covers by handing over Rs 500 or Rs 1000. More than 100 people have visited the office since morning with enquiries. We have been explaining to them that we are not authorised to accept the banned notes,” said a clerk at Jubilee Hills post office.
Chaotic scenes were witnessed outside many petrol bunks across the city. If long queues of vehicles disrupted traffic outside fuel stations, then customers arguing with operators to accept the cash made further delayed the service. Most of the petrol bunk operators accepted fuel of only Rs 500 or Rs 1000 and refused to give out change citing shortage.
At supermarkets and grocery stores, the credit and debit card machines came to the rescue as consumers extensively used their plastic money to make purchases. 
Grocers running without computerised billing accepted Rs. 500 notes but refused to part with change. ""Purchases can only be made for the entire amount being paid. We do not have change,"" said one grocer near Kandiguda in Sainikpuri.

People found it difficult to travel in buses and other modes of transport as they could not carry currency notes of small denominations to pay for the facility. Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were not accepted at petrol pumps, shops, hotels, and toll gates. 
Scores of vehicles were stranded at toll plazas on National Highway-44 as users could not pay toll charges using the invalidated currency.
Roadside eateries, vegetable and fruit vendors, hawkers, pushcart owners, tea sellers and even cinema theatres did not accept bigger notes. Consequently, markets appeared sluggish and financial transactions were badly affected. People seemed to be in utter confusion over the fate of the notes that were in their possession.
Homemakers, who approached post offices to exchange their currency, were left disappointed.

The Rs. 500 note was paid to him by his employer towards wages at Jainoor mandal headquarters in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district.
“I am lucky to get Rs. 450. Others are getting only Rs. 400,” he said, revealing the undesirable economic dynamics which were set in motion on Wednesday in the rural areas of Adilabad and other districts.
“The Transco revenue wing is not accepting the Rs. 500 bill. So many of us have been turned away for not being able to produce Rs. 100 or lower denomination for paying our electricity bill,” said Thumre Manik Rao of Bhuktapur locality in Adilabad town.

The Centre’s move to control black money has also stirred a hornet’s nest as those who had stashed away huge sums are trying to find ways to legalise the currency. “Usually, the currency hoarders will be on the lookout for small income tax returnees so that at least some quantum of black money can be converted into white through their accounts,” said a CA, who did not want to be identified.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Demonetisation-sets-undesirable-dynamics-into-motion/article16441463.ece,ADILABAD

A few businesses in three of city’s largest markets including Abids, Secunderbad and Begumpet-Panjagutta that worked through the night are believed to have catered to sudden surge in footfalls and met a demand many times average daily sales. It was also learnt that the deadline of midnight when the notes lost their monetary worth, was circumvented by tinkering with billing.
“The market witnessed sales many times what is seen on Dhanteras or Akshaya Tritya. It was a mad rush and many shops remained opened through the night at the request of customers,” informed a trader who did not wish to be identified.
Another trader hinted that the software used in billing systems can be tinkered to reflect a desired time or date. However at big-brand stores in Panjugutta, traders simply did not bother with bills. Customers were free to buy gold without considering jewellery design and pay using demonetised currency. 
“We did receive reports of some jewellers working past midnight but most of the market in Hyderabad had closed after the announcement was made.

Time was 10.48 a.m. on Wednesday.
Sitting in his nondescript vegetable shop near the entrance to the normally bustling Kaloor market, Jamaal wore a confused look.
Just a while ago a couple of his trusted clients had paid in Rs.500 notes on shopping. “They were regulars and could not be turned away unlike people who came in the guise of customers looking for change. The real impact will be known only by Thursday when suppliers return after today’s [Thursday] motor strike,” he said.
At his abattoir a few metres away, Shiraas continued to accept ‘banned’ notes. “We have no black money to hide and therefore can change these notes at the bank. Business is already bad, and we can’t afford to turn our customers away citing the note issue,” he said.
At Saritha theatre, moviegoers had to check their wallets for Rs.100 or lower denomination notes. “No question of accepting bigger notes as they are no longer legal tender,” Sethunath, theatre manager, put it bluntly.
There was a minor melee during the previous night’s second show. Alerted to the withdrawal of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, spectators started crowding the eatery with notes, Mathew, a ticket counter staff, recalled. At his roadside kiosk near the theatre, Noufal sat idling away his time. With just three Rs.100 notes in his cash box, he could neither buy fresh stock nor do any business. He had to turn away quite a few customers who had come with banned notes.
It was 11.22 a.m., and Benjamin looked around his deserted medical shop, which usually teems with customers. With the business having been hit, he had already started accepting cards for as low a purchase as Rs.10.
Anand, an employee at the Supplyco-run petrol pump near Durbar Hall Ground, expected more trouble as motorists streamed in. The lower denomination notes had literally exhausted, and customers were agitated over the failure of the outlet to tender balance. “We told them they could fill petrol for Rs.500 or Rs.1,000, but for anything less, we insisted that they give change,” he said. At just past 12 noon, the “note issue” dominated the chat between staff and passengers at the Ernakulam KSRTC depot. “Some depots had started exhibiting placards declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes were not accepted, though we haven’t done it as yet,” said station master Viswambaran.
At Bevco’s self-serving premium outlet just a stone’s throw away beyond the A.L. Jacob flyover, employees had a leisurely day. With a board kept outside declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes and credit/debit cards were not accepted, sales were reduced to a trickle at the outlet, which usually logs a daily business of over Rs.10 lakh.
Shiju had been operating the automatic ticket vending machine at the eastern entry of the south railway station for hours by the time the clock ticked past 12.30 p.m. He held Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in one hand as if they were a testimony to his helplessness. “Passengers can either wait till enough change is collected to get the balance on buying tickets, or they can give change,” he said and passengers seem convinced.",Kochi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/Demonetisation-spells-confusion-for-Kochiites/article16441262.ece,KOCHI
2016-11-10 00:00:00,Demonetisation trolls dominate social media,"Social media had only one topic trending in the hours after the Centre announced the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes on Tuesday night as in one sweep, it upstaged the entire debate about the US presidential election.
Soon after posts alerting to the declaration of demonetisation by the Prime Minister, a no-holds-barred social media spar of trolls between pro-Modi and anti-Modi camp followers erupted. This was interspersed with serious posts for and against the view that the move would check black money.
But the most entertaining were posts and trolls by people who owed allegiance to neither camp but tried to find the funny side of a new dawn without the ‘big’ notes. One such troll made a mock request to Prime Minister Modi on behalf of Indian expats not to declare Indian passports invalid for travelling to India one fine midnight. There were plenty of trolls drawing link between demonetisation and the state of mind of political leaders. A former Chief Minister and his two Cabinet colleagues in the UDF government who are facing corruption charges were the pick of such trolls which said that they were yet to regain consciousness after collapsing on hearing the declaration.
Another post featured a dialogue from the blockbuster movie Aaram Thampuran delivered by Mohanlal that there would come a time when bundles of notes would not even have the value of paper. An aggrieved troller felt the government was beating up the entire population for the crime committed by a few by withdrawing currency notes all of a sudden. As posts emerged from a pro-BJP camp that the new currency notes to be launched were to feature nano GPS, that became the theme of a flurry of trolls.
One seemingly innocuous post with dollops of sarcasm wondered whether the GPS in currency notes could be leveraged for Wi-Fi connectivity. Another troll wanted to know whether those currency notes would have 13 mega pixel camera and such other features of a smart phone.
Many posted images of wallets containing a few soiled Rs.10 notes and coins with the caption that it was one of those rare moments when being poor felt being good. Malayalees’ penchant for ‘spirited’ trolls came to the fore as there appeared ones which downplayed the information on places where the banned notes would be accepted with a query whether they would be accepted at Bevco outlets. “The most repeated question today is whether cards are accepted at Bevco outlets,” said another troll.",Kochi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/Demonetisation-trolls-dominate-social-media/article16441276.ece,KOCHI
2016-11-10 00:00:00,Pravasis stunned by demonetisation move,"“Stunned.” This is how many Kerala Pravasis described their initial reactions to the news of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement on Tuesday night.
“As soon as the PM’s speech on the TV was over,” Jeby Thomas, a white-collar employee in a company in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, told The Hindu on the phone, “I called my wife in Pathanamthitta to put her in the crisis management mode.”
This was typical of the response of a large number of Kerala Pravasis in the Gulf countries. Mr. Jeby pointed out that his family always kept around Rs.50,000 liquid cash at home to meet emergency situations. “I told my wife how to dispose of the notes in the next few days.”
In the Gulf Cooperation Council countries — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Qatar and Bharain — Indian banks and money exchanges had stopped accepting the demonetised Indian notes on Tuesday night itself, sources said. In Oman, public sector banks like SBT and private money exchanges implemented the demonetisation immediately after Mr. Modi’s announcement.
K.V. Shamsudeen, who has been working in the UAE for four decades and who is a volunteer financial adviser to the Kerala Pravasis, said most of the Keralite community in the UAE was startled by the demonetisation.
He pointed out that Keralites usually kept a fair amount of Indian rupees with them so that they could use it while travelling to India. Now these “emergency funds” might turn out to be of no value. Mr. Shamsudeen pointed out that one UAE Malayali had on Wednesday sought his advice on how to cash the Rs.6 lakh he had kept with him.

2016-11-10 00:00:00,Demonetisation causes cash famine in Malabar,"Business was in low gear across the north Kerala region on Wednesday as merchants and traders tried to make sense of the demonetisation and shoppers and customers struggled hard to cope with the shortage of legal-tender money with them.
People woke up to the reality that most of the cash they had with them were of no use immediately. Towns and cities in the region soon realised that they were in the grip of a financial famine.

‘Marriage shopping’ hit

Kozhikode, the hub of Malabar’s trade, was under a partial commercial paralysis as the banks were shuttered, ATMs were closed and people had no money to pay for their transactions. S.M. Street in Kozhikode, the largest retail shopping centre in the entire Malabar, reflected the gloom. The area, usually bursting at the seams with shoppers, was not crowded on Wednesday. Businesses reported that sales were down to less than a half as they could not accept Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. There was a heavy decline in the wedding-related purchases which are referred to as ‘marriage shopping.’ As the banks and ATMs were closed, the customers were not able to take out cash to pay for high-volume purchases.
However, larger shops in S.M. Street and the upmarket ones across the city that accept credit and debit cards said there was an increase in business using the cards.
Reports from Kannur, Kasaragod, Vadakara, Kanjangad, Kalpetta and many other towns indicated a marked decline in business. In the eastern upland areas, sale and purchase of agricultural products were heavily hit.
A natural-rubber trader at Thiruvambadi in Kozhikode district said that he had withdrawn Rs.2 lakh, all in 500s, from his bank last evening. But, since the cash was of no use on Wednesday morning, he opted not to open his shop.

Land deals

Land-deal registrations across the region was crippled as the parties could not pay the registration fee and related expenses to the government in cash. For instance, at a sub-registrar office (SRO) in Kozhikode city, none of the nine registrations scheduled did not take place. A document writer told The Hindu that his client had got around Rs.5 lakh ready in 500s and 1,000s on Tuesday itself to be paid as stamp duty and registration fee. However, registration of wills and partition deeds were done as the expenses were small.
Some restaurants in the city had to close in the afternoon as their customers could not pay up in small-denomination notes.

2016-11-10 00:21:00,"Demonetisation of rupee notes: Banks to remain open on Saturday, Sunday","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has directed banks to limit cash exchange for banned notes to Rs.4,000 from Wednesday until November 24, and told lenders to remain open on Saturday and Sunday.
The cash exchange limit will be increased after November 24, according to the central bank.
While banks will open Thursday, automated teller machines (ATM) will start functioning from Friday.
According to bankers, RBI has already sent all the banks Rs. 2,000 denomination currency notes in large boxes on Wednesday and asked lenders to ration its distribution.
The Rs.2000 currency notes will not be available in the automated teller machines (ATM) immediately as the machines need to be recalibrated, a move which may take at least two weeks, bankers said.
As of now, only 100 and 50 denomination notes will be available.
“RBI has instructed us to ensure everything goes smoothly so that the customer do not panic,” said the chief executive of a public sector bank. “They have asked us to open all the branches on Thursday.”
While there will be limit on how much a customer can exchange, but there will no limit for depositing money in bank accounts. Any deposit of more than Rs.50,000 requires a PAN card.
The RBI has also asked banks to remain open on Saturday (November 12) – which is a second Saturday of the month and Sunday (November 13). Bank branches remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays.

2016-11-10 00:20:00,Indian 'jugaad' to beat rupee demonetisation,"When push comes to shove, one turns an innovator. Or how else could one view the creative ingenuity of these people.
Though Centre declared that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 would not be legal tender any more from midnight on Wednesday, it left some time-window. Cashing in on this, Hotel Saravana Bhavan, a chain of hotels head-quartered in Chennai, having 36 branches across the state, has opted to accept Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes from its customer.
The hotel’s creative in-charge K. Kamalakannan, said: “We are accepting the notes. We will exchange them when the banks open doors,’’ he said.
There is an hitch, however. Tendering change has proved a big challenge for the hotel.
Couple of its customers hit upon an interesting solution for this predicament. Though they are unknown to each other, they chose to share their bills. One of them paid the combined bill, and the other promised him to do an online recharge of his portion!
Using credit card to pay your coffee bill! Not an Indian practice. And, certainly unheard of in Chennai. Have coffee at a Sangeetha restaurant in city and settle your bill through credit card. A small amount but a significant giant movement towards cashless society!
C. Sivasankaran-promoted nascent taxi hailing company UTOO Customer said it would accept Rs.500 notes but won’t tender change. Instead, it said it would give a credit note, which a customer could use for another trip! “To ease your travel, we will accept account payee cheques as mode of payments,’’ it said.
Even an IOU (I owe you) letter will do, said Mr. Sivasankaran. Tata to an old order, hail the new change!
Well, this bank has decided to reward anybody who embraces change. Indusind Bank said it would offer 2X reward points to its customers who use credit cards to transact. A well-designed change story, a rewarding one at that!

2016-11-10 00:18:00,"Currency demonetisation has precedence in India, elsewhere","India is not the only country to have opted for currency demonetisation. There are similar examples from other countries as well.
On demonetisation of higher denomination banknotes, the RBI said, “Rs.1,000 and Rs.10,000 banknotes, which were then in circulation were demonetised in January 1946. The higher denomination banknotes in Rs.1,000, Rs.5,000 and Rs.10,000 were reintroduced in the year 1954, and these banknotes were again demonetised in January 1978.”
Zimbabwe is another example, which went through hyper-inflation in 2008 following which its currency lost value. In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said the country had “adopted the multiple currency system or dollarisation in 2009 and it is therefore necessary to demonetise the Zimbabwe $ unit to replace it with the multiple currency system.” In Zimbabwe’s case, demonetisation was critical for policy consistency and for enhancing consumer and business confidence, its central bank had said.
In Singapore, though Japanese “Banana” notes had been in circulation during the Japanese occupation, after the Japanese surrendered, the note was demonetised in 1945, the ‘Singapore Mint’ said.
In Fiji, its Reserve Bank said, “demonetisation of the pounds and shillings was necessary as Fiji transitioned to the new decimal currency structure from January 13, 1969.” It added, “Due to limited quantities remaining in circulation, these notes and coins now have collectors’.”
The central bank of the Philippines, decided to demonetise the New Design Series banknotes issued on 12 June 1985, to “align with the practice of other central banks around the world which change the design of their currency that has been in circulation for over 10 years.”",Economy,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Currency-demonetisation-has-precedence-in-India-elsewhere/article16441006.ece,NEW DELHI
2016-11-10 00:24:00,"U.S. poll result, demonetisation hit stocks","The Indian stock market fell about 1,700 points during the morning session on Wednesday, mirroring a global trend, before staging a recovery on the back of banking and pharmaceutical stocks. Stock markets around the world saw sharp declines from fear of trade barriers that could arise if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump keeps his campaign promises. Indian indices too fell in sync, catalysed by the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, before recovering by the end of Wednesday.
The victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential polls led to a global sell off on concerns of possible trade barriers. The demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in India also acted as a catalyst.
The benchmark Sensex lost 1,688.69 points during the pre-open session to touch a low of 25,902.45. Later in the day, it recovered partially to close at 27,252.53, down 338.61 points or 1.23 per cent. The broader Nifty lost 111.55 points or 1.31 per cent to close at 8,432.

Massive sell-off

During the early morning massive sell-off in the Indian market was part of global negative sentiment with the Dow Jones futures shedding more than 600 points and the leading Asian indices like Hang Seng and Nikkei losing 494 points and 920 points, respectively.
“The U.S. presidential elections took the markets by surprise,” said Kamlesh Rao, chief executive officer, Kotak Securities. “The markets initially went into some tailspin as there have been previous concerns about possible trade barriers with other nations.”
“Volumes may see a dip in the near future especially from the retail investors. However, the HNI (high net worth individual) and institutional volumes may not be impacted significantly. The volumes will pick up over medium term to long term,” added Mr. Rao.
The technology sector bore the maximum brunt as Mr. Trump has already mentioned about his reservations on the H1-B visa programme under which Indian software engineers go to the U.S.
TCS was the worst performer in the Sensex pack, shedding 4.93 per cent to close at Rs.2,171.05. Infosys also lost 2.74 per cent to close at Rs.955.85.
Realty was another sector that lost ground owing to the government’s sudden crackdown on black money.
The BSE Realty index lost 10.23 per cent while sector heavyweights like Indiabulls Real Estate, DLF, HDIL and Oberoi Realty all losing in the range of 10-20 per cent each.
“The banning of large denomination currency may be a bit painful in the shorter term but definitely better for long-term in terms of better tax compliance, control on corruption as well as inflation,” said Motilal Oswal,chairman and managing director, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
A total of 2,157 stocks lost ground on BSE, with only 610 gainers.
Banking stocks, however, managed to buck the trend with State Bank of India gaining 2.83 per cent while Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank moving up over one per cent each.

Rupee recovers

Despite a weak opening, the rupee ended stronger as compared to the dollar as the central bank intervened in the currency market. The rupee ended the day at 66.44 against the dollar as compared to its previous close of 66.42 per dollar. The rupee opened at 66.79 per dollar and went on to touch 66.93 before recovering.
“State-run banks were selling dollars on behalf of the central bank. The recovery of the stock market also helped the currency,” said a currency dealer.
Bonds also gained as demonetisation of currency is expected to cool inflationary pressures.

2016-11-10 00:00:00,Demonetisation leaves the common man cash-starved,"Across Kerala, like elsewhere in the country, the impact of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes on the daily lives of people has been frustrating, annoying, and confusing, depending on which good or service they sought.
At the Central railway station in the capital, there were many who arrived with Rs.1,000 notes to purchase platform tickets for Rs.5.
“It came as an iruttadi (bolt from the blue) for me as I need to make a series of small and medium purchases for the wedding of my sister’s daughter next week,” a harried man, who cursed himself for withdrawing Rs.4 lakh in cash, all in 500s and 1000s, from a bank three days ago, told The Hindu in Kozhikode on Wednesday.

Many rebuffed by shops

“I came to know about the demonetisation only this morning as I had missed the TV news last night.” He still made it to S.M. Street here with a bundle of Rs.500 notes hoping to make some purchases, but was rebuffed by the shops.
Welcoming the demonetisation step taken by the Centre, former UN financial expert and corporate finance consultant T.S. Anantharaman said in Thrissur that the move would help to check the flow of hawala money.

Beneficial in the long run

“Most of the NRIs, especially in the lower strata of society, depend on hawala transactions. They mainly use the currency notes of denominations 500 and 100 for their transactions. Though the move will cause some issues in the initial stage, it will benefit in the long run,” he said.
But, in the interim, confusion reigns. “There are customers who have withdrawn large sums for marriage functions scheduled for November 10, 11, and 12. They have contacted us for guidelines, but we are clueless,” said Padmakumar, a bank employee and leader of the Bank Employees’ Federation of India in Alappuzha.

In for turmoil

“There is no intimation yet as to when we would get the new currency notes,” he said, hinting at the disorder awaiting the bank branches. “Trading is virtually at a standstill,” says Sabil Raj, Alappuzha district general secretary of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithy.
“The decision will cause some inconvenience for the farmers for a short but critical harvesting period, it is a welcome move,” says Prasanth Rajesh, Wayanad Coffee Growers’ Association president.
Shaji Mullookkaran, an engineer engaged in providing support service for power inverters installed at banking institutions across Palakkad district, said it was his affinity for plastic money that helped him adhere to schedules on Wednesday.
“It was a big relief on Tuesday night when a leading grocery shop in Palakkad with credit card facility sent its customers SMS saying that it would function till midnight. I went there at 11.30 p.m. to buy vegetables and other essentials. Decided not to become part of the long queue at ATMs on Tuesday night as I can fill fuel in my car using credit and debit cards. During lunch time, I opted to be in Ottappalam so that I can swipe my card at the restaurant there.

2016-11-11 23:05:00,IIP rebounds but demonetisation a dampener,"Industrial output grew 0.7 per cent in September compared with the same period a year ago, snapping a two-month contraction, government data showed.
The Index of Industrial Production contracted 0.7 per cent in August, and shrank 2.5 per cent in July. The move back into growth territory was driven mainly by consumer goods, with consumer durables especially seeing a strong turnaround.
A healthy contribution by consumer durables is likely to be short-lived, with experts saying that the government’s demonetisation move will dampen consumption in the remaining two quarters of the year.
“Growth has come in at 0.7 per cent for the month, which is much lower than our expectation of 3.1 per cent which was based on the better performance of infra industries and retail sales in October which should have been backed up by higher production,” Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Care Ratings said. “The recent demonetization will push back consumption in Q3 and a recovery can be seen with a lag in Q4 at best.”
“Under these circumstances we expect IIP growth for the year to be between 1-2 per cent as against 3-4 per cent posted earlier,” Mr. Sabnavis added.
The consumer durables category in the IIP grew a robust 14 per cent in September, up from the 2.2 per cent seen in August. This pushed the growth of the overall consumer goods category up to 6 per cent in September from the 0.7 per cent in August.
The capital goods category extended its run of poor performance with 11 consecutive months of contraction. The category contracted 21.6 per cent in September compared with 22 per cent in August.
The manufacturing sector recovered marginally, growing 0.9 per cent following two consecutive months of contraction. The electricity sector grew 2.4 per cent in September, much faster than the 0.1 per cent growth rate seen in August.
“In terms of industries, twelve out of the 22 industry groups in the manufacturing sector have shown positive growth during the month of September 2016 as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year,” according to a government statement.",Business,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/IIP-rebounds-but-demonetisation-a-dampener/article16325338.ece,NEW DELHI 
2016-11-10 21:30:00,Demonetisation: BJP flays State govt. stance,"BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, on Thursday, asked the Kerala government to make it clear if it stood with the poor or with hoarders of unaccounted money and fake currency racketeers. 
Condemning the State government’s criticism of demonetisation which, according to him, was a ‘transformative action’, Mr. Madhav said the government led by the CPI(M) opposed it for political expediency. 
“I have read in one [news]paper that Pinarayi Vijayan, when he was in the Opposition, accused [then] Chief Minister Oommen Chandy of corruption in the Vizhinjam project to the tune of Rs.6,000 crore. What’s that Rs.6,000 crore money? Is it not black money? Papers in this State have also reported that huge amounts of black money are stashed away in cooperative banks and Income Tax Department sources have given figures like Rs.30,000 crore. Doesn’t this bother the Finance Minister here? It’s that money, the illicit money that needs to be brought out (sic),” he said. 
Mr. Madhav also claimed that the Modi government had been able to bring out Rs.1,25,000 crore stashed away in tax havens abroad. He reiterated that the ban on higher denomination currency would unearth black money stored in hard cash, but was evasive about the measures taken to unearth the major part that would have already been funnelled into the system. 
As a measure to prevent currency counterfeiting, the government had introduced tighter security measures in the new currency bill of Rs.2,000, he claimed, maintaining that “it cannot be easily faked”. 
Asked about the futility of issuing higher denominations if the government’s intent was to check hoarding of black money, he said this was warranted as most legal transactions even now took place in cash. “And, we are moving towards a less-cash economy, not a cashless economy,” he announced, saying there would be more digital and plastic money transactions.

2016-11-11 12:36:00,The Dummies’ Guide to Demonetisation,"What do I do with my Rs. 500/- and Rs. 1000/- notes now that they’ve ceased to be legal tender? Are they worthless now?

No, these notes still have value. You can stop taking photos of them as wrappers of peanuts to circulate on Whatsapp. There are two things you can do with the notes you have on hand – deposit them in your bank account or exchange them for notes of other denomination. There is no limit for the old notes to be deposited in your bank account, and the money will get credited in your account immediately.
Also, you can get these high denomination notes exchanged for notes of other denomination at any bank or post office where you don't have an account, provided you produce any identity card issued by the government. There is, however, a limit for getting old notes exchanged. It is Rs. 4,000. And now that the ATMs are open, you can withdraw a maximum of Rs. 2,000.
But Rs. 4,000/- is simply not enough for me!
If you’re in need of more money even after getting Rs. 4,000 in exchange, you can withdraw from your account the existing balance, or load the defunct notes into the account and make withdrawals in denominations of Rs. 100, Rs. 50, Rs. 20 and Rs. 10. The limit for a withdrawal a day is Rs. 10,000. It is capped at Rs. 20,000 a week. As the daily limit varies between banks, it is better to ask your banker and act accordingly.
How much time do I have to exchange my money?
You have till December 30 to exchange the high denomination currency, or deposit them in your bank accounts. If you are in possession of these notes after December 30, you have till March 31 to file a declaration with the RBI to get them exchanged. After that, they’re as good as paper.
I’m not sure I want to deposit my money – apparently, there’s a penalty of 200% on deposits!
No, there’s not. There’s no limit or penalty on the amount of money you deposit in your account right now.　
But the Revenue Secretary said so! Our deposits are going to be tracked!
Brevity may be the soul of wit, but unfortunately, not of The Income Tax Act, 1961. The Revenue Secretary has said (rather, tweeted) four very important statements, which are to be analysed before arriving at any conclusions. The first statement is as follows.
1. ""We would be getting reports of all cash deposited during 10th Nov to 30th Dec.2016 above threshold of Rs.2.5 lac in each A/C.""
Now, the first tweet talks about a Rs. 2.5 Lakh threshold. This is not an arbitrary number. It is the maximum exemption limit for income tax for individuals. Basically, you are not liable to pay the tax if your annual earnings are below Rs. 2.5 Lakhs. So if you’re a non-earning member who has saved money, you can deposit your savings of up to Rs.2.5 lakhs without wondering if you’ll be pulled up by the tax authorities for having money in your account, out of the blue. If you’re a senior citizen over the age of 60, the limit goes up to Rs. 3 Lakhs, and if you’re a super senior citizen over the age of 80, 5 Lakhs.
Next, he talks about ‘getting reports’. The fact is that the government and Revenue Department had been keeping track of high value cash deposits for a few years now. If you have seen your tax credit statement, the 26 AS, there is a section called ""Annual Information Return"", where banks are mandatorily required to furnish information about high value transactions that are linked with your PAN. So keeping track of your cash deposits (especially high value deposits) is not something novel that the government is going to do now that the demonetisation has been announced.
But what about the tweets where he talks about income tax action and 200% penalty?
This is what his other three tweets said:
2. ""Income Tax department would do matching of this with income returns filled by the depositors. And suitable action may follow.""
3. ""If cash amount of above Rs10 lac is deposited in a bank a/c not matching with declared income, same will be treated as tax evasion""
4. ""In such case,tax amount plus a penalty of 200% of the tax payable would be levied as per Section 270(A) of the income tax Act""
We are in November 2016, which forms part of the Financial Year 2016-17. You are required to file your Income Tax Returns for this financial year by 31st July 2017 (the regular due date) to declare your income, or you can take time up to March 2019 to file it under the belated provisions (although you lose the benefit of being able to revise your return).
First, keep in mind that the income tax authorities have access to your 26AS, where there are details of both the income earned (on which tax has been deducted at source), as well as high value transactions that were reported in the AIR.
If you report or declare your ‘large’ deposit of cash in your account along with the income you have normally earned during the year, and pay tax on both your income as well as the deposit, then you will see no further consequences.
If, on the other hand, if you don’t declare the deposit, there is a chance that your return of income will be picked up for scrutiny by the Income Tax authorities, wherein they will question the source of your deposit, and ask for an explanation.
If you are able to substantiate a legitimate source, and the authorities are satisfied with your explanation, then you don’t face a penalty.
If, however, the case is such that you have intentionally suppressed facts, recorded false entries in books, or that you aren’t able to substantiate evidence, then the authority will pass an order stating that you have misreported your income for the year, and you will be liable to pay a penalty of 200% tax on misreported income. Note that it isn’t 200% of the income itself, but on the tax component.
Also note that in order for penalty to rise, three conditions have to be fulfilled. First, you should have omitted the deposit from the declaration of income in your income tax return. Second, your return should have been pulled up for scrutiny. Third, upon given the chance to explain the source of said omitted deposit, you are unable to substantiate evidence to prove its legitimacy. Unless all three are fulfilled, penalty does not arise.
Ok, help me understand with an example - If I have one crore of cash to deposit, what is the penalty I should pay?
If you deposit the one crore in your bank account, show it in your income tax return for the FY 2016-17, and pay tax on your income at the maximum marginal rate (assuming that you are not claiming it as business income, where you are given the benefit of claiming expenditure), you are NOT liable for any penalty, because it is not misreported income. The tax authorities will see that you have declared it and paid tax on it, thus making the deposit a legitimate credit.
If, on the other hand, you deposit this one crore in your bank account, omit it from your declaration of income (and therefore not pay any tax on it), and your return gets picked up for scrutiny, you will be given an opportunity by the authorities to explain the source. If you are unable to substantiate and prove that the cash you deposited is a fruit of money that you’ve earned legally and paid tax on, it will be considered misreported income, and you’ll be required to pay 200% tax on this misreported income as penalty.
So…
If they’re legitimately earned cash deposits whose source you can explain – no penalty.
If you intend on showing it in your income tax return, including it in your income earned during the year, and pay tax on it – no penalty
If it’s a deposit that you’ve not declared/omitted from your return, not paid tax on, and aren’t able to prove as legitimate if and when your return of income is picked up for scrutiny – penalty.
Any other advice?
Try your best to exchange and withdraw minimally, ensuring that people from lower income groups who survive entirely on cash aren’t sent back on account of lack of funds. Use mobile wallet services, debit and credit cards instead.
Wherever possible, give underprivileged people you know, change for their Rs. 500/- and Rs. 1000/- notes when they ask for it during these few weeks. You could also guide them on how they can get their money exchanged, or exchange it on their behalf.
The most important piece of advice I can give you, is this – If you have a considerable amount of cash to be deposited, or know someone who does, or are generally looking for comprehensive information and customized advice relating to the demonetization scheme, hire a Chartered Accountant to help you with the process, instead of looking to twitter and social media to clear your doubts. Seriously.

Sex workers who charge below Rs. 500 are facing tough time as they have hardly got any customers in last two days.
Prospective customers first inquire whether the sex workers will accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. “If we say no we will lose the customer. We have to accept the notes and Durbar and Usha bank had assured us that our money will not go in waste,” said Rekha a sex worker.
In the last two days, sex workers in and around Sonagachi have deposited more than Rs. 55 lakh in Usha Multipurpose Cooperative Bank, which was formed and is run by former sex workers in 2001 for women in the same trade.
“Due to the huge rush of customers in Sonagachi, the sex workers in last two days have deposited more than Rs 50 lakh in their bank accounts in Usha Bank. Generally sex workers prefer to keep money in their homes but after demonetization, there is a rush among sex workers to deposit money in the bank,” Shantanu, a senior official of Usha Bank said.
In normal circumstances Usha Bank does business of around Rs 5 lakh per day. ",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-creates-brisk-business-for-sex-workers/article16315616.ece,Kolkata

2016-11-11 22:41:00,Demonetisation: Residents continue to grapple with after-effects," The city continued to grapple with the after-effects of the decision by the Centre to demonetise Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes, on Friday. 
Many faced difficulties in withdrawing cash from their bank accounts and from ATM kiosks. 
People had to wait in long queues at the branches of nationalised and private banks to avail new notes after surrendering their demonetised notes and to withdraw cash from their accounts. 
The delay in commencement of the functioning of ATMs added to the woes.
Migrant labours working for various construction projects were the worst affected by the demonetisation. 
Subrata Modak and five others from West Bengal, working as masons for a project of construction of a multi-storied building, were standing in a queue before a nationalised bank at Mahaveer Circle. Mr. Modak said that the refusal to accept Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes at hotels and grocery shops on Wednesday and Thursday created many problems for them. 
Some grocery shop owners refused to tender change and demanded that they make purchases for the full amount. 
Mr. Modak and his friends had availed leave from work on Friday and were waiting in queue to get the new notes in exchange of demonetised notes with them.
Yogishwarappa, a resident of Danihalli near here, had been to the city to attend a wedding.
 A friend from his village, who is suffering from an auto-immune disease, requested him to bring home medicines. 
Mr. Yogishwarappa said he had planned to purchase the medicines by withdrawing cash using his debit card. 
He expressed displeasure against the delay in opening of ATM kiosks and said that the government should have intimated the people on the actual time of commencement of the service of cash withdrawal at ATM kiosks to avoid inconvenience.
At many banks, there was delay in honouring cheques for withdrawal of money from accounts owing to deficit of cash. 
Some ATM kiosks in downtown areas, including B.H. Road, Nehru Road and Park Extension commenced functioning at 4 p.m., but ran out of cash within a hour.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Demonetisation-Residents-continue-to-grapple-with-after-effects/article16324627.ece,Shivamogga
2016-11-11 15:23:00,Demonetisation will greatly benefit economy: Amit Shah,"BJP national president Amit Shah on Friday dared the opposition to make a political issue of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8. In a historic decision of this sort “some pain was inevitable” but the government would protect the interest of the honest tax payers, farmers, housewives, and the poor, Mr. Shah said.
 
 
His remarks came in the background of a notice moved by the Trinamool Congress in the Rajya Sabha questioning the government’s move and statements terming the move as an attempt at imposing an “economic emergency” by BSP chief Mayawati.
 
“I want the opposition to try and make this a political issue. The people are with the government on this unprecedented move to fight black money, corruption and terror funding. It is an economic emergency for Mayawatiji perhaps,” he said, when asked whether the move would be a poll plank in the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand.
 
“In this country there are elections every year and this decision has not been taken keeping politics in mind,” he added.
 
Poser to parties
 
“I do want to ask the Congress, the Samajwadi Party, the BSP, the Aam Aadmi Party and the Trinamool Congress as to why they are upset? They should answer whether they are in support of black money? Or hawala traders, drug peddlers, or terror funders? Because those are the only people this move hurts,” Mr. Shah said.
 
He appealed to the people to be patient for the long term betterment of the economy. He admitted that the BJP’s core voter base of small traders have been in touch with the party leaders.
 
‘No prior knowledge’
 
He emphatically denied that the BJP or anyone in its organisation had prior knowledge of the move. “Except the government ministers and officials and those constitutionally obligated to be informed, no one knew about the move,” he said.
 
“We are aware that there is some discomfort to the people over this, but when such tough decisions are taken, this happens. Except that lasting discomfort will be for those who have black money, the discomfort to the honest tax payer will be of a few days,” he said.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-will-greatly-benefit-economy-Amit-Shah/article16312789.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-11 03:17:00,Entry operators cashing in on demonetisation,"Taking advantage of the widespread panic triggered by the government’s decision to scrap Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denominations, gangs of entry operators have become active, offering exchange of old to newly printed notes at rates ranging from 5 to 40 per cent.
Several operators are directly approaching people queued up at banks to help them exchange as many Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes as required by arranging people with valid identification cards. One person is currently allowed to get converted cash of Rs.4,000 per day.
While small-time operators are charging 5 per cent for exchanging notes, the rate goes up to 40 per cent for larger amounts, running into lakhs.
In case of huge cash, the operators have been offering exchange after a period of about three months, the time they would take to push the old notes into the banking system through a large network of entry agents working in different banks in various States. It would also require surreptitious transportation of cash by carriers.
“If our banking operations are foolproof, such modus operandi being employed to somehow convert the unaccounted cash into new currency notes will not succeed. However, if these elements manage to either hoodwink the banking system or connive with insiders, their job gets done. At the branch level, it would be important to ensure that cash handlers verify the original and valid identification documents of depositors and keep a proper record of the same,” said a PSU bank official.
The official said there was also a possibility of the same set of identification documents being used at various banks for the purpose, which should be prevented.
“The very essence of the entire exercise is to exchange only that much cash which gets back into the banking system. Therefore, proper verification of identities of depositors and follow-up action is a must. Bank account holders should deposit large sums of cash directly in their accounts instead of going for exchange of notes,” said the official.
While entry operators are busy making money out of the demonetised currency, a significant amount is also being used to purchase “black” gold and precious gems.

2016-11-11 19:47:00,Karnataka’s film industry dismayed by demonetisation,": The demonetisation of existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, and the introduction of Rs. 2,000 currency notes have seriously affected the Kannada film industry, especially the exhibition sector. Two films that were expected to release today have been postponed. Producers attributed the decision to the paucity of currency of smaller denominations with the audience.
Exhibitors, especially owners of single screens, are planning to stop screening films if the situation does not improve by tomorrow. K.V. Chandrashekar, owner of three single screens, told The Hindu that the impact of demonetisation doubled with the circulation of new Rs. 2,000 notes. “Most people are bringing Rs. 2,000 notes but we are not in a position to return Rs.1,920 to them as the ticket rate is only Rs. 80. So they are returning disappointed. Viewership has also reduced significantly. What is the best we can do under the circumstances, except stop screening?” he asked.
It’s a similar situation in most single screens across the state, especially in Bengaluru, said Mr. Thomas D’ Souza, proprietor of single screens in the outskirts of the city.
Multiplexes have also been affected although their situation is not as difficult as that of the small screens. A senior executive from PVR Cinemas said on condition of anonymity, “It has impacted us to a certain extent, but not much.”
The demonetisation has affected the prospects of films that are ready for release, or on the sets, to a certain extent, admits Sa. Ra. Govindu, president of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce. “Production has also been affected as workers who are from ‘cash and carry’ tradition are yet to adjust to the ‘cheque culture’,” said noted producer N. Kumar.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Karnataka%E2%80%99s-film-industry-dismayed-by-demonetisation/article16319986.ece,BENGALURU

The banks, which were closed on Wednesday, reopened at 10 a.m. to long queues that had begun forming from about an hour earlier. In some branches of State Bank of Mysore, the gate had to be manned by security guards are people started to barge into the already crowded premises. People were let in only after some of those already inside came out.
Many had a difficult time exchanging the old notes and those who were in need of large amounts of cash for payments bore the brunt. Customers were left disappointed as no bank was able to provide the new Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000 notes as they had not arrived yet.
Only Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 rupee notes were given. Some customers even opted for Rs. 10 and Rs. 20 notes.

Rs. 2,000 notes from today

District lead bank manager K.N. Shivalingaiah, who visited various branches to check the scene, told The Hindu that Rs. 2,000 notes have now reached the currency chest and will be distributed from Friday. “However, new Rs. 500 notes are yet to reach us...it may take a couple of days,” he said.
Appealing to the public to not panic and rush to the banks in hordes, Mr. Shivalingaiah said banks will remain open on Saturday and Sunday and people can dispose off the old notes till December 30.

Senior citizens complain

Many senior citizens, who were seen standing in long queues on Thursday, complained of lack of separate arrangements for them at the banks.
“Banks have become either insensitive or ignorant to consider having a special queue for older people. How can we stand in long queues for hours and exchange cash?” asked a senior citizen at a bank on Rama Vilas Road.
The rush in branches of SBI and SBM in particular was heavy.
However, Mr. Shivalingaiah said the rush will subside over the next week, especially once the ATMs become operational again. All the banks have been asked to configure the ATMs and this is likely to be done by Friday, he said.
He also said all the banks have sufficient quantity of lower denomination notes, mainly Rs. 100 and Rs. 50, for exchange.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/As-banks-reopen-in-Mysuru-people-rush-to-exchange-demonetised-notes/article16442437.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-11 19:02:00,Demonetisation cripplestreasury functioning ," As demonetisation cripples the functioning of treasuries across the State, the government is reportedly groping in the dark to find out options for resuming financial transactions at the earliest.
Finance Department sources told The Hindu here on Friday that treasuries were forced to make pension and other payments from their imprest fund provided by banks to meet their urgent needs.
Payments of bills for all civil works executed by government agencies, Plan projects of local bodies and such others have been suspended due to funds crunch. Treasury personnel are a confused lot as they have not been authorised to collect currency that is not legal tender. 
Though Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had written separate letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley seeking urgent intervention to the impasse in treasuries, it had not elicited any response, sources said.
Local bodies as well as Revenue Department offices that collect property and land tax are finding the going tough for want of specific directions. But the Finance Department has directed Revenue and other government departments to collect taxes, be it Rs.1,000 or Rs.500 denominations. 
Urban and rural local bodies are unwilling to accept Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. This has taken a heavy toll on their own fund, that is mainly derived from property and other taxes, sources said. 
Treasury being the fulcrum of the financial transactions of the government and other allied agencies, unless the Centre responds to the request for intervention and offer a solution, the crisis will worsen in the coming days. The Centre should essentially clarify whether the treasuries could accept the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes and also continue transactions as usual, or it would further worsen the crisis, sources said.
Draw of Kerala Lottery would remain suspended for the next two days too. The daily collection from the sale of lottery tickets has dipped from Rs.28 crore to Rs.8 crore. The government would have to review the situation before resuming the draw. 
An 80 per cent dip has been reported in the daily collection of the agents attached to the Kerala State Financial Enterprises.

2016-11-11 00:57:00,Demonetisation raises fears of cash distribution in Thiruparankundram,": The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has triggered apprehensions of possible distribution of more cash (of the withdrawn currency) among voters in Thiruparankundram Assembly constituency, where by-election is due on November 19. 
A section of politicians, especially those belonging to smaller parties, fear that candidates of bigger parties might seek to dispose of the demonetised currency to a section of voters. BJP candidate R. Srinivasan claimed that some candidates of larger parties have already started distributing money to voters in certain areas. “If the illegitimate money, which they possess, cannot be exchanged by party men, they will definitely try to distribute more money to voters in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations in a bid to secure victory,” he said.
D. Siva Muthukumar, Madurai urban district unit secretary of DMDK, claimed that certain corrupt candidates could be exploiting the poor by distributing more cash and asking them to exchange it for legal tender in banks. “The poor, who are already used to waiting in long queues like in ration shops, will now have to queue up before banks,” he claimed.
M. Thiagarajan, a resident of Thiruparankundram town, claimed that candidates of two parties had already distributed money once in his neighbourhood. “With the ban on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currencies, there is a strong rumour now that there will be another round of distribution,” he said.
Mr. Srinivasan demanded that the volume of currency exchanges and deposits in banks located in the constituency should be monitored by election officials. He added that the bank accounts of those in Thiruparankundram should also be monitored, as majority of the people, even from rural areas, have bank accounts now to receive MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) wages and other subsidies. “Monitoring of the volume of transactions now and post-election is likely to show sudden spike,” he said.
L. Mahadevan, candidate of Naam Tamilar Katchi, demanded deployment of additional monitoring teams in the constituency to control cash distribution.
Acknowledging the risk of the demonetised currency being distributed, Madurai Collector and District Election Officer K. Veera Raghava Rao said that the poll surveillance teams already on the field have been asked to maintain strict vigil. “Central armed forces have also joined now. We are monitoring the situation continuously. If needed, additional teams will be deployed in consultation with observers, ” he said.
Speaking to The Hindu, General Observer for Thiruparankundram constituency U.V. Jose said that the issue was discussed in detail with all senior election officials and police officers in the district. “So far, we have not received any direct complaints. We have the cushion to deploy additional teams for surveillance if the situation warrants,” he said.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-raises-fears-of-cash-distribution-in-Thiruparankundram/article16292961.ece,MADURAI

A cross section of people, who patiently waited in the banks, expressed satisfaction at the arrangements made.
People came to the banks with identity card and its photo copy even before the bank branches opened for the day’s business in both the urban and rural areas alike.
Expecting huge crowd, all the branches opened two or more special counters especially for the exchange of higher denomination currency. Special arrangement at the entrance to explain to people the formalities to be adopted at the entrance was in place in all the branches, which made the job of the anxious customers easy.
Many people were disappointed as a majority of the bank branches did not disburse the new Rs. 2,000 notes. Only a few bank branches gave the new currency. However, people expressed satisfaction that the banks disbursed Rs. 100, Rs. 50 and Rs. 10 denomination notes up to Rs. 4,000.
When contacted, senior officials of various bank branches said that they did not get adequate Rs. 2,000 currency.
Due to the crowd, some bank branches in the city ran short of the money by noon itself.
The customers were assured of new currency or lower denomination notes on Friday.
The bank staff posted at the front office, the security personnel and the police men gave adequate information to the customers about the special counters, the denominations available, forms to be filled, documents to be attached to them, which was well appreciated.
The other regular activities such as depositing and withdrawal of money went on as usual, according to the bank authorities.
The two head post offices in Salem city and in Suramangalam and also the other post offices opened special counters for the benefit of its customers. About 10 special counters were opened at the head post offices, including counters exclusively for women. Midway through the Salem HPO ran short of money.
The waiting people were issued tokens and the money disbursement was resumed after adequate money was received from the banks.
K. Swaminathan, president of the Salem District Bank Employees Association affiliated to the AIBEA, expressed satisfaction at the arrangements and commended the bank staff for performing an exemplary job under trying circumstances.
Adequate police personnel were posted near all the banks to regulate the crowd. The senior officials visited the branches at regular intervals to monitor the situation.

2016-11-11 19:34:00,Demonetisation hits NRIs,"HYDERABAD: Demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes has not only taken the Indian citizens by surprise but also has created some issues for the Non Resident Indians living overseas. 
The ripple effect of cancellation of high value notes has been felt across the borders with huge population of Indian diaspora living in countries like the US, Canada, the UK and Dubai, among others as they suddenly found themselves holding worthless Indian currency.
“Many are irked by the fact that there is no clarity yet on how they can exchange these invalid notes and where,” said Malini who got a call from her friend Anuradha living in Canada.
Some of them plan to send the cash with their relatives or friends travelling to India to be exchanged before the deadline or to be deposited in banks here. But not many are comfortable with the idea either, Ms.Malini said. 
Many NRIs who are in similar situation made attempts to exchange the cash but there are no takers as yet for want of clarity or instructions from Indian government to their embassies and High Commissions. This according to NRI sources in Toronto, became quite an issue that found coverage in the local newspapers too. 
No travel plans
Syamala, a US citizen, who keeps few thousands of Indian currency mostly in high value notes, to spend during her trips to India, has no clue how she can exchange the invalid notes in her possession now. “I don’t plan to travel to India at least for next eight months nor I can exchange them with foreign currency now,” she rues.
The NRIs and Indians with US,UK citizenship have been calling their friends and families back home on how they could exchange the cash stuck with them as most of them do not have plans to travel to India in the near future. 
William, who works for a UK based MNC, travels to India on work for the company’s Indian subsidiary. He called his colleagues here to ask how he could exchange the USD 400 worth Indian currency in his possession.
Sandilya, an architect who works in Dubai, said he had a few Rs.500 notes which he tried to exchange with a currency exchange firm in Dubai. But they refused to accept the cancelled Indian currency in the absence of instructions either from Indian government or the currency exchange’s head office.
“Many of us have no idea what to do with the few Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes we have now. There is no communication for NRIs either from the Indian government or banks so far,” he said.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Demonetisation-hits-NRIs/article16325205.ece,
2016-11-11 02:38:00,"SP, BSP object to demonetisation, says it’s akin to Emergency","Heavily criticising the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s sudden step to demonetise currency notes, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Thursday equated it with the imposition of an “emergency” in the country. The parties, the BJP’s main opponents in Uttar Pradesh, said the decision was taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeping in mind the upcoming State elections.
If BSP chief Mayawati described it as an “undeclared financial emergency” implemented by Mr. Modi to divert people’s attention from his government's failures, SP boss Mulayam Singh Yadav demanded a rollback of the decision for a few days, at least a week, to allow common people to make adjustments.
Mr. Mulayam and Ms. Mayawati said the Centre’s move had led to chaos and confusion, and adversely affected access to services and normal life for the poor, farmers, labourers, small traders and women.

BJP exudes confidence

The BJP has, however, in its public rallies and statements, popularised the demonetisation as a “surgical strike” against black money, and off-the-record, its leaders exude confidence that its political opponents would be worst affected due to the prevalence of unaccounted cash in campaigning in the State.
They claimed Ms. Mayawati’s call for an emergency meeting of office-bearers on Thursday and Mr. Mulayam’s demand for a rollback for a certain period were hints that the parties were rattled. Ms. Mayawati’s opponents and rebels have often accused her of auctioning party tickets. Many SP leaders, including controversial minister and Mulayam-confidant Gayatri Prasad Prajapati, are also accused of amassing disproportionate wealth.
Without naming anybody, BJP vice-president Dinesh Sharma took a dig at the SP and BSP for their opposition to the demonetisation. “Some parties are saying they should get more time so that they can convert black money into white. Some political parties are depressed,” Mr. Sharma said.

‘Sadistic pleasure’

While lashing out strongly at Mr. Modi, Ms. Mayawati said the sudden decision to demonetise currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 seemed less in public and national interest and more of a “sadistic pleasure”. If the Modi government was honest about fighting black money, why did it wait for more than two-and-a-half years after coming to power, she wondered. Ms. Mayawati said the common refrain was that the BJP had taken the step after it had “done bandobast” (taken measures) to financially strengthen it by stashing funds abroad through its collusion with capitalists, whom it favoured. The BJP has stacked enough funds abroad to serve it for a hundred years, she said. “Now that they are done with it, they are remembering black money,” she said.
While reiterating that his party supported the fight against black money and was “against its use in elections”, Mr. Mulayam Singh said chaos had been unleashed in the name of bringing back black money. He said the sudden scrapping of notes had caused a lack of trust in business, social tension, and an adverse impact on women.

‘Blind following’

“Common people should get a chance. Later, nobody should be given a chance. After that we are with you in this fight against black money,” Mr. Mulayam Singh told reporters. The SP chief said, “it seems Modi wants to mortgage the nation in the hands of some capitalist families,” even as he said his party would protest against the decision. Referring to the death of an invalid woman due to shock in Kushinagar as she was stranded with Rs. 500 notes, Mr. Mulayam demanded that the cut-off deposit for women be increased to Rs. 5 lakh.
The BSP chief also attacked BJP chief Amit Shah for lauding Mr. Modi’s step as a “surgical strike,” saying it was an instance of “blind following”. If the government had raided the homes of the top 500 or 1,000 capitalists and recovered black money, it could be termed as a surgical strike, she said.

‘Poor inconvenienced’

Ms. Mayawati also wondered how the demonetisation would help curb black money when more than half of the country’s 125 crore people were poor small traders and labourers. “Do they have black money that they are being subjected to inconvenience?” she asked. “How can we expect a government to end corruption when it helped corruption accused Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi escape abroad?”",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/SP-BSP-object-to-demonetisation-says-it%E2%80%99s-akin-to-Emergency/article16442080.ece,LUCKNOW

What’s that Rs.6,000 crore money? Is it not black money? Papers in this State have also reported that huge amounts of black money are stashed away in cooperative banks and Income Tax Department sources have given figures like Rs.30,000 crore. Doesn’t this bother the Finance Minister here? It’s that money, the illicit money that needs to be brought out (sic),” he said.

“In the name of tackling corruption, a scam is being carried out at a large scale. Some evidence has to come to light and TV channels are showing it, it is not something new that I’m saying,” Mr. Kejriwal told reporters in a press briefing on Saturday.
“On November 8, when Prime Minister Modi announced that Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes are not legal tenders any more, they had already informed all their friends and BJP people, who actually have all the black money,” Mr. Kejriwal alleged.
He further alleged that those who large amounts of black money had got enough to time to take care of it, before the decision to scrap the notes was officially made.
“In last three months, money has been deposited in all banks at a large scale, running into thousand of crores of Rupees. This arouses suspicion,” he alleged. “When the deposits in quarters before that were in the negative or there was no growth, how did suddenly such high deposits where made between July and September quarter? Whose money is this and how did such large scale deposits happen?” he said.
“It is the common man who is suffering due to this as those who have black money, have already done the setting. New notes are being home delivered to them for a commission,” he alleged. “There are huge queues outside banks, are there any big industrialists or black marketers in the queue? No. Shopkeepers, rickshaw pullers, auto rickshaw driver, farmers and labourers are in the queue. Do they have all the black money?” he said.
Mr. Kejriwal alleged that demonetisation has led to a system of commissions and provided a fillip to black money instead. “Gold rate have gone up and black money has gone up instead of decreasing,” he alleged.
“If the government had completely scrapped Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes, we would have supported you,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal said that by introducing Rs. 2,000 notes, black money problem would not be taken care of.
“People are unhappy and poor people have to pay commission to convert their hard earned savings,” he said. “There is going to be a 200 per cent penalty on deposits above Rs. 2.5 lakh. You will take penalty from poor people who have saved Rs.. 5 to Rs. 6 lakhs over 10 years for their daughter’s wedding? God will not spare you,” he said.
Mr. Kejriwal also alleged that the real black money is in Swiss bank accounts, which Mr. Narendra Modi had promised to bring back before becoming Prime Minister but have not done anything on this issue since then. He said that he has those account numbers and if the government wants to take action against black money, they should arrest these account holders immediately.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Kejriwal-alleges-huge-scam-behind-demonetisation/article16373822.ece,New Delhi

“Savings that were kept in different forms particularly in the form of currency notes, they will now move into bank deposits. So we will see some surge in bank deposits,” Mr. Panagariya added.

Mr. Modak said that the refusal to accept Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes at hotels and grocery shops on Wednesday and Thursday created many problems for them.
Some grocery shop owners refused to tender change and demanded that they make purchases for the full amount.
Mr. Modak and his friends had availed leave from work on Friday and were waiting in queue to get the new notes in exchange of demonetised notes with them.
Yogishwarappa, a resident of Danihalli near here, had been to the city to attend a wedding.
A friend from his village, who is suffering from an auto-immune disease, requested him to bring home medicines.
Mr. Yogishwarappa said he had planned to purchase the medicines by withdrawing cash using his debit card.
He expressed displeasure against the delay in opening of ATM kiosks and said that the government should have intimated the people on the actual time of commencement of the service of cash withdrawal at ATM kiosks to avoid inconvenience.
At many banks, there was delay in honouring cheques for withdrawal of money from accounts owing to deficit of cash.
Some ATM kiosks in downtown areas, including B.H. Road, Nehru Road and Park Extension commenced functioning at 4 p.m., but ran out of cash within a hour.

He said about 100 crore people of country are now on the roads but the Government is indifferent with regard to the 648 bigwigs who have hoarded lakhs of crores of black money in Swiss banks. He demanded that the Centre reconsider its decision of the ceiling of Rs.2.5 lakh for deposits into bank accounts.
He also wondered at the silence of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao on demonetisation and there was no clarity on CM’s talks with the Governor. He also questioned Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya’s explanation that there was no discussion between Governor and Telangana CM. “Why is the Union Minister bothered about those talks,” he asked.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Shabbir-slams-demonetisation/article16375641.ece,
2016-11-12 20:32:00,Venkaiah Naidu justifies demonetisation move,"HYDERABAD: Union Minister for Urban Development M.Venkaiah Naidu justified the demonetisation move by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the mantra to galvanise the economy, reduce inflation, moderate real estate prices, increase the GDP and attract investments.
The decision has multifarious advantages, and has been hailed by the IMF and Goldman Sachs as a great measure, he claimed, and assured that it will bring funds for the welfare schemes for the poor.
Refuting the criticism that the Prime Minister had done nothing to bring back the black money stashed away in overseas banks, Mr.Naidu, at a talk organised by the city BJP here on Saturday, said a special investigative team has been constituted to look into the overseas black money issue, and the ‘Undisclosed foreign income and assets (imposition of tax) Act’ has been brought in.
Collaboration with other nations for automatic exchange of information with regard to Panama accounts, tax information agreement signed with the USA, and agreements with tax havens such as Switzerland, Cyprus and Mauritius to avoid double taxation were aimed at curbing the black money parked abroad, Mr.Naidu said.
This move has also put paid to the “conspiracy by Pakistan” to circulate counterfeit currency and promote terrorism. Smugglers, drug traffickers, child traffickers, and terrorists who have been trying to destabilise India by running parallel economy will be the sufferers now, Mr.Naidu claimed.
“Though some people are visiting ATMs for photo-ops, I have received positive feedback from people who are willing to take the trouble for the country’s sake,” he said taking an indirect dig at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

2016-11-12 22:42:00,Demonetisation woes: Long wait breeds frustration among commoners,"HYDERABAD: Four days of trying time scurrying for cash and standing in long queues before the banks and ATM machines has been enough to swing the people’s mood from that of hope and admiration for the decision to demonetise Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes to that of distrust and cynicism.
Those standing in the serpentine queues before the banks and ATM machines for hours to exchange or deposit their invalid notes in the bank or draw cash gave vent to their frustration that the government should have been more thoughtful about the disruption it would cause to lives of common people. 
“Why are the commoners and middle class getting harassed when they wanted to draw or exchange their own money,” asked a working woman who could finally draw cash after repeated attempts on Saturday in Narayanaguda.
Ashok, a driver who has to perform his son’s marriage in a few days, is a worried man because of the cash crunch and the banks would not give more than Rs.4,000 in exchange and the ATMs more than Rs.2,000, if he is lucky to get his turn before the cash runs out.
Rajyalakshmi, a senior citizen with indifferent health, was fortunate as a public sector bank in the Jubilee Hills was thoughtful enough to give priority to senior citizens. But her worry is about the repeat trips she has to make to the bank as Rs.4,000 will not last long as she has to pay her domestic bills and purchase medicines. 
Interestingly, some public sector banks got deposits into the Jan Dhan accounts of the poor in the last four days. The word is that those with unaccounted money are parking their money in these accounts by giving a nominal commission to the account holder. A bank officer admitted they received deposits into couple of such accounts. “We accepted the deposit by following the norms of Know Your Customer. If a third party came, we accept the deposit by taking an authorisation from the account holder,” he said.
Meanwhile, despite the banks working long hours and even on Saturday, there is no let up as yet for the people’s woes due to short supply of currency notes. A bank manager in Khajaguda said that they had to load the ATM with Rs.100 notes three or four times. The cash had to be arranged and loaded while people in the queue had to wait. “We disbursed Rs.13 lakh on Friday,” he said. However, in some private bank ATMs, the rush has eased to some extent.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Demonetisation-woes-Long-wait-breeds-frustration-among-commoners/article16375616.ece,

In Goa, politicians have parked their black money in large-scale real estate investments in recent weeks and months. With advance information of the move, the politicians have transferred the black money burden onto the unsuspecting property owners who sold their land holdings, said AAP convenor in Goa, Valmiki Naik, and demanded a thorough investigation into all recent land deals registered in the last two months in Goa.
“Ordinary people are facing the hardships while the real culprits, the black money hoarders and influential quarters linked to the political powers have managed to stash their cash”, charged Goa AAP convenor Valmiki Naik here on Saturday.
Reitertaing AAP’s consistent support of any move against corruption and black money in the country, AAP spokesperson Ashley de Rosario said , “ But the manner in which the Modi government has implemented the demonitization scheme, it reeks of a scam and has only ended up burdening the common folks with the financial chaos witnessed across the country.”
The AAP leaders said that their national Convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has revealed that deposits of thousands of crores of rupees in the last three months have shown a sharp rise raising questions and suspicion about the Modi government's intentions.
Deposits suddenly spiked in the last three months, which raises more questions and suspicion about the Centre’s move, they quoted Kejriwal as saying.
The AAP leaders lamented that the honest and hardworking citizen has become the victim facing unbearable difficulties with the financial system in disarray.
“Access to your own hard-earned money has become burdensome,” said Mr. Naik and lamented that while the common man is queuing up at banks and ATMs, the crony-capitalists are unaffected by the chaos in the country’s financial system.",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Demonetization-a-massive-scam-AAP/article16443750.ece,PANAJI

The show, which was to be held at the All India Fine Arts & Crafts Society, “had to be postponed as the participants — be it exhibitors, dealers buyers or enthusiasts— have no small currency for travel and accommodation”, said organiser Mukesh Verma, a numismatist and dealer himself. The seven-day exhibition will now be held in April 2017. Visitors at the show can buy, sell or exchange old coins, notes and stamps.

The ripple effect of cancellation of high value notes has been felt across the borders with huge population of Indian diaspora living in countries like the US, Canada, the UK and Dubai, among others as they suddenly found themselves holding worthless Indian currency.
“Many are irked by the fact that there is no clarity yet on how they can exchange these invalid notes and where,” said Malini who got a call from her friend Anuradha living in Canada.
Some of them plan to send the cash with their relatives or friends travelling to India to be exchanged before the deadline or to be deposited in banks here. But not many are comfortable with the idea either, Ms.Malini said.
Many NRIs who are in similar situation made attempts to exchange the cash but there are no takers as yet for want of clarity or instructions from Indian government to their embassies and High Commissions. This according to NRI sources in Toronto, became quite an issue that found coverage in the local newspapers too.

No travel plans

Syamala, a US citizen, who keeps few thousands of Indian currency mostly in high value notes, to spend during her trips to India, has no clue how she can exchange the invalid notes in her possession now. “I don’t plan to travel to India at least for next eight months nor I can exchange them with foreign currency now,” she rues.
The NRIs and Indians with US,UK citizenship have been calling their friends and families back home on how they could exchange the cash stuck with them as most of them do not have plans to travel to India in the near future.
William, who works for a UK based MNC, travels to India on work for the company’s Indian subsidiary. He called his colleagues here to ask how he could exchange the USD 400 worth Indian currency in his possession.
Sandilya, an architect who works in Dubai, said he had a few Rs.500 notes which he tried to exchange with a currency exchange firm in Dubai. But they refused to accept the cancelled Indian currency in the absence of instructions either from Indian government or the currency exchange’s head office.

2016-11-12 00:00:00,Demonetisation cripples treasury functioning,"As demonetisation cripples the functioning of treasuries across the State, the government is reportedly groping in the dark to find out options for resuming financial transactions at the earliest.
Finance Department sources told The Hindu here on Friday that treasuries were forced to make pension and other payments from their imprest fund provided by banks to meet their urgent needs.

Payments of bills

Payments of bills for all civil works executed by government agencies, Plan projects of local bodies and such others have been suspended due to funds crunch. Treasury personnel are a confused lot as they have not been authorised to collect currency that is not legal tender.
Though Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had written separate letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley seeking urgent intervention to the impasse in treasuries, it had not elicited any response, sources said.
Local bodies as well as Revenue Department offices that collect property and land tax are finding the going tough for want of specific directions. But the Finance Department has directed Revenue and other government departments to collect taxes, be it Rs.1,000 or Rs.500 denominations.
Urban and rural local bodies are unwilling to accept Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. This has taken a heavy toll on their own fund, that is mainly derived from property and other taxes, sources said.
Treasury being the fulcrum of the financial transactions of the government and other allied agencies, unless the Centre responds to the request for intervention and offer a solution, the crisis will worsen in the coming days. The Centre should essentially clarify whether the treasuries could accept the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes and also continue transactions as usual, or it would further worsen the crisis, sources said.

Lottery draws suspended

Draw of Kerala Lottery would remain suspended for the next two days too. The daily collection from the sale of lottery tickets has dipped from Rs.28 crore to Rs.8 crore. The government would have to review the situation before resuming the draw.
An 80 per cent dip has been reported in the daily collection of the agents attached to the Kerala State Financial Enterprises. This is likely to diminish further, sources said.

2016-11-13 20:53:00,RTC suffers huge loss due to demonetisation ,"VIJAYAWADA: The ban on big notes by the Centre has impacted the APSRTC which suffered a loss of more than Rs. 5 crore in the last few days.
The RTC earns about Rs. 10 crore per day (The income depends on muhurtams and festivals). But it had to cancel some services due to poor Occupancy Ratio (OR), the authorities said, leading to a loss of about Rs.1 crore a day. 
Many passengers are postponing or cancelling their journeys due to lack of change as the conductors are insisting on exact fare and are not accepting the old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 notes.
The APSRTC, which has the largest fleet in the country, transports 65 lakh passengers over 45 lakh km by operating 12,000 buses every day. It employs 61,000 workers and runs services to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Telangana.
“The average OR in APSRTC is 68 per cent. But the ratio has dropped to 62 per cent and below in the last five days. On November 10, the OR was 60 per cent and on the next day it was 62 per cent and there was a drop in reservations and current bookings in many services on November 11 and 12,” said RTC Executive Director (Operations) G. Jaya Rao.
The officials said they expected good revenue during the Karteeka Masam and the muhurtams. 
“The Corporation is operating about 650 buses to Hyderabad and about 500 buses to Tirupati from various destinations. But the OR has come down in many routes. We have not booked any Karteeka Masam packages too and the city services were badly hit,” said Corporation Chief Traffic Manager (CTM) Srinivas Brahmananda Reddy.
“Due to poor OR, advance and current reservations, we are forced to cancel buses in some routes. We are making efforts to increase the OR by maintaining small notes in the ticket issuing counters and with the conductors,” Mr. Jaya Rao told The Hindu.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/RTC-suffers-huge-loss-due-to-demonetisation/article16378886.ece,
2016-11-13 21:56:00,Demonetisation: Rajnath dials CMs on law and order ," Home Minister Rajnath Singh has dialled Chief Ministers of at least 10 States to monitor law and order issues being reported in the wake of the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 to discontinue the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.
On November 10, two days after the announcement was made, the first number that Mr. Singh dialled was that of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Only a day ago, the staunch critic of Mr. Modi had spoken in support of the demonetisation move.
“The call was made by the Home Minister to extend all possible help from the Centre. Bihar Chief Minister was the first one he spoke to and after that he dialled several other Chief Ministers also,” said an official at Mr. Singh’s office. 
The CMs who were dialled mostly comprised the BJP-ruled States of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana, Assam and Goa. The other States were Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar.
The official confirmed that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was not on the dialled list, nor was Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
Ms. Banerjee has criticised the Centre’s move and asked it to withdraw the “hasty decision” and “first put a proper action plan in place.” Mr. Kejriwal has called the ban on Rs. 500 and 1,000 notes as the “biggest scam in recent times.” 
On Sunday, Mr. Singh held a meeting with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and officials of the security establishment to analyse the security complications arising out of the cash crunch.
“The main thrust of the meeting was to look for measures to reduce queues outside banks and ATMs. Another important points discussed were ways to stop rumour mongering and mischievous news that were only adding to the confusion,” said the official.
The Parliament session begins this week and Mr. Singh who also heads the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs is to meet several political leaders. ",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Rajnath-dials-CMs-on-law-and-order/article16379095.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-13 18:57:00,Political parties must welcome demonetisation: Amit Shah," Lashing out at political parties including the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), BJP president Amit Shah said in Dehradun on Sunday that the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would have been appreciated by the political parties had they not hoarded money through corrupt means.
Speaking during BJP’s “Parivartan Yatra” in Dehradun, on Sunday, Mr Shah said, “There is hue and cry within the SP, the BSP, the Congress, and [Arvind] Kejriwal’s party [after demonetisation]. If Modiji took a step to curb black money, why is it hurting you [the political parties] so much?”
Calling Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s “solidarity” with the common man over demonetisation a “façade”, Mr Shah said, “Modiji took a historic and brave decision of demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Should [all] political parties not appreciate the decision against black money, terrorism, hawala operators…? But, they won’t appreciate it because the money that these parties and their politicians earned through corrupt practices is now valueless.”
Stating that the BJP was fully aware with the problems the common man was facing due to demonetisation, Mr Shah said the issue was temporary and the problem was not only limited to the common man, it involved all the BJP workers too.
Calling the hoarding of money a “disease”, Mr Shah said, “People are standing in queues for hours and we understand their problems but if an individual catches a disease, the doctor has to operate the individual after which the individual has to be under bandages for few days. But, once the bandages are off the individual leads a healthy life.""",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Political-parties-must-welcome-demonetisation-Amit-Shah/article16378579.ece,Dehradun

While the ATMs of the SBH, Indian Bank, Axis Bank and the Corporation Bank remained closed, people stood in long queues before the ATMs of other banks to withdraw cash of Rs. 2,000.
Several ATMs were open, but ran out of cash, and the card-holders returned dejected.
Customers who made withdrawal at Kotak Mahindra Bank branches were given Rs. 2,000 note each, as the bank had no currency of other denominations. Those exchanging Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes got two Rs. 2,000 notes.
The scene was different in Andhra Bank branches, where people exchanging the banned notes for Rs. 4,000 were given two bundles of Rs. 20 notes, as the bank ran out of Rs. 100 notes. However, account holders withdrawing cash from the ICICI Bank were given three notes of Rs. 2,000 and 40 notes of Rs. 100.

2016-11-13 17:51:00,Demonetisation will spur economic growth: CII," The decision by the government to demonetise high denomination notes is likely to have a far-reaching impact, striking a blow at the heart of the illegal economy, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). 
This is an economic master stroke by the Prime Minister and must be allowed time to play out, a press note quoting Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, said. “After a short period of some pain when the economy adjusts to the sudden withdrawal of cash, the CII expects a much stronger economy. the transition to a greater usage of fintech for payments will trigger a rise in spending, leading to higher economic growth”.
Mr. Banerjee said lower cash use would have a dampening impact on inflation and this would be a further positive for India’s macro fundamentals, he observed.
Pointing out that the Reserve Bank of India would now have more room to cut interest rates as inflation comes down, Mr. Banerjee said demonetisation would have a positive impact on banks as deposit mobilisation goes up, resulting in increased liquidity. 
“This is also a great opportunity to transition to a “plastic economy,” where there is a prevalence of debit and credit cards for transactions” the press note said. The CII said the demonetisation would curb illegal activities like corruption, racketeering, human trafficking and gambling. 
“For industry, this is a welcome move with very positive implications. It will strike at the heart of the parallel economy, which provides unfair competition to organised industry,” it added.",Kerala,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Demonetisation-will-spur-economic-growth-CII/article16378420.ece,Thiruvananthapuram

Talking to reporters on his way to New Delhi, Mr. Vijayan said payment of utility bills such as electricity and water charges, college fees and fees levied by local bodies for various services could be paid up to November 30 without fine. The tax levied by the Motor Vehicles Department for commercial vehicles, taxis and autorickshaws would be accepted up to November 30.
However, there would be no extension of the date for payment of VAT and excise duty.
Coming down heavily on the Centre, Mr. Vijayan said “it is now clear that the demonetisation move was not aimed at checking black money as it is made out to be. It emerges that black money holders were given time to secure their assets. Recent deposits made by the BJP have also come under a cloud.”
He said the Prime Minister was on tour as the country was going through a chaotic phase. Patients were finding it difficult to buy medicines and avail themselves of treatment at hospitals; ration shops were being looted and people were driven to suicide after finding their hard earned money blocked.
The Centre, he said, had failed to make alternative arragement and to ensure sufficient stocks of currency to replace the denominations that had ceased to become legal tender. He urged the government to permit transactions in Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes up to December 30, the time allowed for exchange of notes.

2016-11-13 00:06:00,Demonetisation slows down economic activity," The demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denominations and the consequent currency shortage have slowed down the economic activity in the State, leaving the population resentful because they could not get sufficient cash in the lower denominations needed for daily expenses.
Banks across the State opened special cash counters to meet the currency rush, but short supply of currency notes, particularly Rs.100 notes, neutralised their efforts. Cash dispensing through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) was limited.
Some banks could operate ATMs attached to their respective branches. But smaller banks preferred to shut down their ATM booths. The currency note shortage tested the tempers of customers, leading to altercation in several bank branches.
The banks did not come out with any official explanations, taking cover behind the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which too did not give any indication about when a solution would come by.
Various sectors have started feeling the pinch of the currency shortage. Problems related to weekly wage payment across sectors, including plantation and construction, have added to the apprehension of the workforce. The retail sector too is grappling with the crisis. Short supply of smaller denominations affected the low income group, particularly in the rural areas, who are not accustomed to online transactions. 
Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy came out strongly against the Central government’s failure to address the issue.

Soundarraj, district secretary, Kanniyakumari District Cooperative Employees’ Association, affiliated to the CITU, here on Sunday.
Mr. Soundarraj told The Hindu that the normal functioning of the PACCS throughout the country was affected, as they could not disburse maturity amounts on fixed deposits and recurring deposits to its members, and the members were not able even to redeem their pledged jewels in time.
Self-Help Group (SHG) members and Joint Liability Groups (JLGs), having account with the PACCS, were not able to transact any business. This affected recovery of loans, and the farmers were not able to avail themselves of crop loans and buy fertilizers, he said.
The shortage of Rs. 100 notes and those below the denomination rendered the people unable to buy essential commodities from ration shops, he added.
As the PACCS were not authorised to accept demonetised currencies, normal life of the rural people, especially the farmers and the downtrodden, was seriously affected, Mr. Soundarraj said.
S. Suresh Kumar, president, Tirunandikkarai Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Society, said ever since the announcement of the invalidation of high value currencies, the day-to-day activities of the PACCS had come to a standstill.
When contacted, a top official of Cooperative Department said only District Cooperative Banks (DCBs) and Urban Cooperative Banks were authorised to receive old currencies from the customers. They were not able to transact any other normal business. To avoid malpractice in registering old notes with back date, the officials had collected closing cash balance as on November 8 from all the DCBs and the UCBs, the official added.
The farmers, however, could avail themselves of crop loans from the PACCS. The farmers’ applications should be sent to the DCBs or the UCBs for cash credit facility.

In a statement, he said even the government had not come out with any plan to make the exchange of currency easier for the people. “Even though the Centre’s move was aimed at eradicating black money, it has actually hit the ordinary people hard. On the one hand banks have very limited notes of Rs. 2,000 and on the other people are not able to utilise the money for lack of smaller denominations,” he said. 
“Goods transport has borne the brunt and small traders have lost their business. People are standing in queue in front of banks and ATMs for hours together while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is travelling in bullet train in Japan,” he said. 
Mr. Stalin said that since fish was a perishable commodity, fishermen , who were not able to sell their catch, had called for an indefinite strike. “Finance Minister O.

Speaking during BJP’s “Parivartan Yatra” in Dehradun, on Sunday, Mr Shah said, “There is hue and cry within the SP, the BSP, the Congress, and [Arvind] Kejriwal’s party [after demonetisation]. If Modiji took a step to curb black money, why is it hurting you [the political parties] so much?”
Calling Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s “solidarity” with the common man over demonetisation a “façade”, Mr Shah said, “Modiji took a historic and brave decision of demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Should [all] political parties not appreciate the decision against black money, terrorism, hawala operators…? But, they won’t appreciate it because the money that these parties and their politicians earned through corrupt practices is now valueless.”
Stating that the BJP was fully aware with the problems the common man was facing due to demonetisation, Mr Shah said the issue was temporary and the problem was not only limited to the common man, it involved all the BJP workers too.
Calling the hoarding of money a “disease”, Mr Shah said, “People are standing in queues for hours and we understand their problems but if an individual catches a disease, the doctor has to operate the individual after which the individual has to be under bandages for few days. But, once the bandages are off the individual leads a healthy life.""",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Political-parties-must-welcome-demonetisation-Amit-Shah/article16444458.ece,Dehradun

2016-11-13 00:00:00,Demonetisation will deter terror funding in India: Minister,"Stating that the decision taken by the Union government to demonetise the currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 was in the interest of the security of the nation, Union Minister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh on Saturday said the step would deter the funding of terrorism in the country.
“It (demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1,000) is going to be a major deterrence as far as the funding of terrorism is concerned. This was one of the main considerations to have arrived on this decision,” Mr Singh told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.
He said what was remarkable about the decision was that it was in the larger interest of the nation, in the interest of the security of the nation as well, “as the interest of the reinforcing economic capability of the nation.”
“I think what is more gratifying is that the common man of the country has welcomed it,” he said.
On the allegations leveled by the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Mr Singh said that the statements which lack any evidence don’t deserve a response.
“I don’t think it deserves any response, we live in an evidence based era and I don’t think I need to respond to any unsubstantiated statements,” he said.

“Move welcomed”

“The 130 crore people of this country have wholeheartedly welcomed it. I was traveling in Uttar Pradesh yesterday, day before in Delhi and today in Jammu and have seen long queues outside the banks of an average common man and inspite of going through all the inconvenience ... there was not a single one who did not say that they did not welcome it,” he said. He said the decision was being hailed as it has come out with sincerity, honesty and courage of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi for standing in a queue at an ATM in Delhi, the Union Minister sought to know who used to go to the ATM on behalf of the Congress Vice President before the decision was taken.
“I usually avoid making personal comments but what amused me was that I wish somebody had asked him had he ever been to an ATM before or was it just after this, decision happened. Who was going to ATM on his behalf on earlier occasions?,” he questioned. - PTI",Delhi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Demonetisation-will-deter-terror-funding-in-India-Minister/article16444076.ece,JAMMU

2016-11-13 15:44:00,Demonetisation cripples fishing industry in Bengal,"
By about 4 a.m. all shops – about 170 – were open on both sides of an unkempt asphalt road. The shops that were selling fish at a wholesale rate were chock-a-block by 5 a.m.. But many of them were not engaging with the trading.
They were small rural fish farmers and sellers, big purchasers from Kolkata. They assembled in Malancha, a gigantic wholesale fish market, about 100 kilometres south of Kolkata, in Sunderbans area, to buy or sell fish like any other day. But the market is 40% to 50% “dry”, they said.
“We assembled early morning, out of habit,” said Gorachand Mondal, a small fish farmer from nearby Chaita village.
Malancha is perhaps the largest wholesale fish market in south Bengal, in North 24 Paraganas district, auctioning about 15 thousand kilogram of fish every day. There are at least a dozen such wholesale markets in south Bengal. And, all are distressed over the demonetisation drive.
The owner of one of the biggest wholesale depot in Malancha – Sonali Fish Centre – belongs to Azibor Rahman. Mr Rahman is in the trade for nearly 50 years but has never witnessed such depression.
“We generate business in lakhs but the banks told us to deposit less than Rs. 2.5 lakh. Moreover, the buyers are tendering Rs. 1,000 notes, which is difficult for us to accept. How are banks benefitting if we are not depositing?” Mr Rahman said. 
With an withdrawal limit of Rs. 10,000 a day, Mr. Rahman refused to pay change to his son, Amjad Ali Molla, a trainee trader. He literally cried before his dad tendered few Rs. 100 notes.
The situation is grim for small farmers. 
“I earn about Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 daily and spend about Rs. 200 to run the household expenses. We deal in Rs. 100 notes and not in Rs. 1000 notes which have disappeared,” Gorachand Mondal said. In his village, the families are incapable of supporting each other.
“All ran out of change…in next two days we will be on road, begging.” 
He shared another alarming information.
""Many of the farmers here are illiterate and keep the cash at home. It’s legal money but they are scared to go to bank traditionally. They are now short-changed by the local agents who are charging 20 per cent for providing ‘change’,"" said Mr. Mondal.
While Mr. Mondal is at the bottom rung of the trade, Mr. Rahman, a wholesaler, auctions the stock to buyers – traders from cities – charging sellers a tiny fee.
They both have now started gasping for lower denomination notes as the big purchasers, like Abdul Rashid Molla, also a supplier to big cities, are staying off the market. 
Instead of entering the Malancha market, 60-year-old Molla is sitting in a tea stall; chewing tobacco and glancing through newspaper. 
“They are all like brothers and there is no point in fighting for Rs. 100 notes,” he said. The absence of men like Mr. Molla, who supplies to Kolkata’s retail outlets, is putting a strain on the market.

2016-11-13 21:42:00,Demonetisation hits Snehasparsam ," The scarcity of bank notes caused by demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes has had an adverse effect on the fund collection for the Snehasparsam Project of Kozhikode District Panchayat’s Kidney Patients Welfare Society, held on Sunday. 
Though the organisers had announced willingness to accept the nullified notes, most people were not willing to give up the notes of lower denominations, said Snehasparsam project coordinator Sreeraj N.
“We had started campaigning months ago and had conducted door-to-door canvassing many times. But the demonetisation was an unexpected hurdle that we could not overcome since it came at the last moment,” he said. 
The fund collection was held in all the 70 panchayats in the district and the municipalities other than Ramanattukara and Vadakara on Sunday. Though there was a provision to deposit online into the Snehasparsam account, the outcome was low since online banking is not very popular in the rural areas. “Many people did not have money with them as they were either jobless or had not received payment from their employers due to scarcity of currency,” Mr. Sreeraj said. On the other hand, there were people who had set aside the sum for Snehasparsam much before the demonetisation came into effect.
“The neighbourhood groups that had contributed up to Rs.27,000 last year had only collected up to Rs.7,000 this time,” he said.
The organisers are expecting the financial crisis to be toned down by November 27 when the fund collection is to take place in Kozhikode Corporation, Vadagara and Ramanattukara municipalities. An executive meeting of the society to be held on Monday will discuss whether the collection in rural areas has to be extended, Mr. Sreeraj added.",Kozhikode,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/Demonetisation-hits-Snehasparsam/article16379061.ece,Kozhikode
2016-11-13 18:59:00,"Madurai Bench, first in the country to decide on demonetisation","Madurai: The nation is yet to recover from jitters sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise address to the people on Tuesday announcing demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, but the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has already created history by being the first in the country to hear, deliberate and dismiss a case against the Centre’s move that has earned both bouquets and brickbats.
However, what made the Madurai Bench reject the case was a decision of the Supreme Court taken on August 9, 1996 by a four-judge Bench of Justices M.K. Mukherjee, Kuldip Singh, M.M. Punchhi, and N.P. Singh upholding the Constitutional validity of the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 enacted during the Prime Ministership of Morarji Desai to demonetise Rs. 1,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10,000 currencies.
Section 2 (d) of the Act defined the term ‘high denomination bank notes’ to mean the three currency notes and Section 3 declared that on expiry of January 16, 1978 all high-denomination notes shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, ceased to be legal tender in payment or on account at any place. Section 4 of the Act prohibited transfer and receipt of the currencies from the specified date.
Assailing the Act, the petitioners before the Supreme Court had contended that it violated their fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 19 (1) (f) and 31 of the Constitution. While the first Article recognised the right to acquire any property by lawful means, hold it and dispose of it freely, limited only by reasonable restrictions, the second Article provided that the State could acquire private property for a public purpose only on payment of compensation to the owner.
Since Section 26 of the RBI Act cast a duty upon the bank to honour the obligation of accepting currencies issued by it as legal tender, it was contended that the Demonetisation Act extinguished the debts due from the RBI to the holders of high denomination notes and that such extinguishment of debts amounted to compulsory acquisition of property without payment of compensation which was mandatory under Article 31(2) of the Constitution.
Rejecting the arguments, the apex court said the contention based on Article 19(1)(f ) was “wholly misconceived for after compulsory acquisition of their property by the impugned Act, the petitioners right thereto stood extinguished and consequently the question of reasonable restriction to the exercise or enjoyment of a right, which became non est, could not arise”. 
On the issue of compensating the holders of demonetised bank notes, the court said: “Equally untenable is the petitioners’ contention that they were deprived of their right to get compensation for such acquisition as Sections 7 and 8 of the Demonetisation Act lay down an elaborate procedure to apply for and obtain an equal value of the high denomination bank notes in the manner prescribed thereunder.”
Taking a cue from that judgement, the Madurai Bench held: “Now Article 19(1)(f) is no more in force. Therefore, as of now, right to own property is no more a fundamental right. Similarly, Article 31 also stands supplemented by certain other provisions introduced. When the Honourable Supreme Court had declared that demonetisation of currency notes did not violate Article 19(1)(f), it is difficult for us to hold that it offends any other fundamental right.”
A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran also went on to state that the present petitioner who had challenged the recent decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had not made out any case, even prima facie, to show that the Finance Ministry’s notification under challenge was either illegal, irrational or it suffered from procedural impropriety or proportionality for the court to exercise judicial review.
On the issue of hardship caused to the common man due to the sudden move, the judges said: “Of course, it is true that it has caused some inconvenience. As expressed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, in his address to the nation, it is not as though the Government was not aware of these possible inconvenience or hardship to the common man and the poor people of this country. 
“His Excellency, the President of India, who himself is a great scholar, economist and who had held the portfolio of finance for a considerable time, has issued a Press Note wherein His Excellency has welcomed the said action taken by the Central Government, which, according to him, will help to unearth unaccounted money as well as counterfeit currency.
“As it has been expressed by His Excellency the President of India and the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, we, the people of this country, should be hopeful that this measure would speed up the growth of the economy.... and it would free the country from corruption, black money, terrorism and other evils,” the judges concluded.",Madurai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Madurai-Bench-first-in-the-country-to-decide-on-demonetisation/article16378584.ece,

On the one hand banks have very limited notes of Rs. 2,000 and on the other people are not able to utilise the money for lack of smaller denominations,” he said.
“Goods transport has borne the brunt and small traders have lost their business. People are standing in queue in front of banks and ATMs for hours together while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is travelling in bullet train in Japan,” he said.
Mr. Stalin said that since fish was a perishable commodity, fishermen , who were not able to sell their catch, had called for an indefinite strike. “Finance Minister O. Panneerselvan has not yet announced any measures to make it easier for people and fishermen,” he said.",Chennai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Demonetisation-has-caused-enormous-hardship-Stalin/article16444276.ece,CHENNAI
2016-11-13 00:00:00,Demonetisation slows down economic activity,"The demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denominations and the consequent currency shortage have slowed down the economic activity in the State, leaving the population resentful because they could not get sufficient cash in the lower denominations needed for daily expenses.
Banks across the State opened special cash counters to meet the currency rush, but short supply of currency notes, particularly Rs.100 notes, neutralised their efforts. Cash dispensing through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) was limited.
Some banks could operate ATMs attached to their respective branches. But smaller banks preferred to shut down their ATM booths. The currency note shortage tested the tempers of customers, leading to altercation in several bank branches.

No explanation

The banks did not come out with any official explanations, taking cover behind the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which too did not give any indication about when a solution would come by.
Various sectors have started feeling the pinch of the currency shortage. Problems related to weekly wage payment across sectors, including plantation and construction, have added to the apprehension of the workforce. The retail sector too is grappling with the crisis. Short supply of smaller denominations affected the low income group, particularly in the rural areas, who are not accustomed to online transactions.
Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy came out strongly against the Central government’s failure to address the issue.",Thiruvananthapuram,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/Demonetisation-slows-down-economic-activity/article16444398.ece,Thiruvananthapuram
2016-11-13 00:00:00,“Inappropriate implementation of demonetisation hurting people”,"Though the union government’s decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,500 currency notes was predominantly welcomed initially, the inappropriate implementation of the scheme had defeated the benefits and stifled business transactions, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said.
Stating that the government’s objective should be to unearth black money and not put the public in distress, the chamber has said that the initial excitement was now turning into frustration. In a press statement issued on Saturday, the chamber has pointed out the main cause of concern was the non-availability of Rs. 100 and the new Rs. 500 denomination notes in banks.
“Most of the ATMs are yet to become fully functional. When people exchange currencies, only Rs. 2,000 notes are given, which does not help meet daily needs as they will not get change anywhere,” said S. Rethinavelu, senior president of the chamber.
The chamber also said in the statement that wholesale traders were facing trouble since their clients, mainly retail businesses, were paying the daily collections in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, which cannot be accepted now as they were no longer legal tender.
The chamber has demanded that the traders be allowed a window till December 15 to collect their business outstandings in old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations. It also made a demand that deposits made by individuals up to Rs. 5 lakh should not be scrutinised.

2016-11-13 19:42:00,"Demonetisation a masterstroke by Prime Minister, says CII","VISAKHAPATNAM: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Sunday hailed the Centre’s decision on demonetisation and said it would strike a blow at the heart of illegal economy.
Describing the decision as a masterstroke by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it said, while it was not possible to have a firm estimate of unaccounted for wealth, it was widely put at around a fifth of India’s GDP, or around $450 billion.
“While some of this may be stored in cash, some may be in assets such as real estate and jewellery. This negatively affects the business environment, especially for those who comply with the law of land and follow ethical practices,” the CII said in a release.
After a short period of pain, the CII expects a much stronger economy. 
“India’s cash dependence is extremely high with a currency-GDP ratio of around 12 per cent compared to 4-5 per cent in other developing countries. High level of cash usage tends to slow down the flow of money through the economy,” the release stated.
“As we transition to a greater usage of financial technology (fintech) for payments, spending will go up, leading to additional economic growth. This is an economic masterstroke by the Prime Minister and must be allowed time to play out,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said in the release.
“The RBI will now have more room to cut interest rates as inflation subsides. Already, the bond market has reacted to the news with reduction in the bond yields,” Mr. Banerjee observed.
For the industry, he said the decision was historic and hoped that it would ensure fair play for entrepreneurs, ending the role of a parallel economy.",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Demonetisation-a-masterstroke-by-Prime-Minister-says-CII/article16378680.ece,

Some smart business entrepreneurs in Visakhapatnam and neighbouring regions seem to have understood the true essence of this and are making the best of the present currency crunch by coming out with clever marketing strategies to keep the cash registers ringing even as several trade and commercial establishments struggle to tide over the crisis generated by the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. 
Hub For Youth Go Karting Arena at Mangamaripeta is offering a special package of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 to encourage people to enjoy an evening there and spend the demonetised notes. “We are offering a special package of four games for Rs 500, which is otherwise charged at Rs 800. Similarly, people can play games worth Rs 1,600 by just paying the demonetised currency of Rs 1,000. We plan to keep this offer on till the end of December,” said Pramod Kumar of Hub for Youth Go Karting Arena. Interestingly, the Go Karting arena has seen their business go up by 40 per cent on Saturday as several people turned up at the entertainment zone to chill out in the weekend and part with the demonetised currencies. 
“We normally see a daily business of Rs 45,000 on an average. Today, we made Rs 80,000 and are expecting a good turnout on Sunday as well,” Kumar added.
A similar strategy worked out well for Plot 17 restaurant that didn’t waste time in bringing out a smart marketing tactics to attract customers. Shortly after the news of demonetisation was out, the restaurant came out with an offer wherein customers could give their Rs 500 notes and enjoy meal worth Rs 600. “We normally get customers who spend Rs 200 or Rs 300 on an average on a single bill.

2016-11-13 00:00:00,"‘Demonetisation will paralyse terror funding, raise tax collections’","Demonetisation will have multiple effects transforming from cash to banking economy, paralyse terror funding and circulation of counterfeit notes and widen the tax base, according to Income-Tax Chief Commissioner Shyama Prasad Choudhury.
In an exclusive interview to The Hindu here on Saturday on the fallout of the withdrawal of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes as legal tender by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Choudhury, who heads operations in AP, said increased use of debit and credit cards and digital wallets would raise the number of bank account holders and help fill the coffers of the government.
“The more important aspect is putting a full-stop to funding the terror networks and huge amount of fake notes being circulated by the terrorists and anti-national forces into the market. The bold move will certainly help the economy manifold,” he said.
Mr. Choudhury said their intention was not to conduct raids as it was an ultimate option. “The government’s focus is to increase tax compliance rate and make all transactions transparent. The fallout of demonetisation will be safeguarding the interest of the nation and facilitate extra revenue collections.”
He expressed satisfaction over the response to the Income Disclosure Scheme (IDS)-2016 in which a disclosure of Rs.13,000 crore was made in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana out of Rs.65,000 crore disclosed pan India. The tax on the disclosed amount as notified earlier would be collected by September, 2017.
The Chief Commissioner said besides educating the public on tax compliance, they would also continue keeping a tab on unaccounted assets and transactions by taking videos of lavish spending at marriages and other social functions. He said search and seizure operations were being undertaken based on inputs received by the department through various sources including social media.
He said as far as the Income Tax Region in Visakhapatnam was concerned, the collections as on November 10 was Rs .1900 crore compared to Rs.1471 crore last year.

Refunds

On complaints regarding delay in refunds, he said following a series of measures, they had streamlined the payment. A refund of Rs.355.40 crore was paid so far as against Rs.222.8 crore during the corresponding period in the region.

Leaders of TMC, RJD, JD (U), CPI, CPI (M), JMM and YSR Congress met the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad in his room in Parliament House and discussed the strategy on how to unitedly take on the government in view of the hardships faced by the common man after the demonetisation of high-valued notes.
The meeting saw archrivals TMC and CPI(M) coming together on a common platform against the government.
Among those who were present included Sharad Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O’Brien of D. Raja, Prem Chand Gupta, Sushil Kumar and M Rajamohan Reddy.
Besides Mr. Azad, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and the party’s deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma were present.
Opposition SP, BSP and AAP that have strongly criticised the government on the demonetisation issue gave the meeting a miss, besides DMK, AIADMK and NCP.
A senior Congress leader said some of the opposition leaders could not attend the meet as they were not in town, but maintained that they were part of a united opposition.

Mr. Radadia and other BJP leaders who are also connected with the state's cooperative sector are set to meet the BJP president Amit Shah in Bharuch where Mrs Shah is scheduled to attend an event. 
""First of all, we have to understand that agricultural economy is cash-based. From buying seeds to pesticides and selling produce, the transactions are done in cash,"" Mr. Radadia, who is also chairman of Rajkot District Central Cooperative Bank, told The Hindu. 
According to him, the RBI has barred all district central cooperative banks, which are connected with millions of farmers from exchanging old notes with new notes and also disbursing new currency notes. 
""In my bank, there are one million farmers holding accounts and they cannot do any transactions in the bank because of the RBI's directive. This has to go otherwise millions of farmers will have no where to go for transacting their banking activities."" 
Another BJP leader Dilip Sanghani, also a former MP and Agriculture Minister of Gujarat, also raised their voice. 
""If the farmers are not allowed cash transactions, entire rural and agriculture based economy will take a severe hit,"" Mr Sanghani said. 
In Gujarat, there are total 207 APMCs and all have been shut since the demonetisation was announced by the Prime Minister on October 8th. 
""At least for next two weeks, most of the APMCs will remain shut for trading because traders have no money to make payments while farmers are not used to taking cheque as they demand cash in payments,"" said Congress legislator and chariman of Jamnagar APMC Raghavji Patel.

After the meeting, Congress deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said, “There is broad consensus that the demonetisation issue should be raised in Parliament.”
However, with many leaders not available, the opposition parties will meet again on Tuesday afternoon to finalise their plans. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party are busy campaigning for the Uttar Pradesh elections and the DMK, AIADMK, NCP and AAP were unrepresented on Monday.
Janata Dal(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who was present at the meeting, told The Hindu, “We are hoping to build the sort of opposition unity that we had on the Land Acquisition Act.” The cohesion then had forced the Modi government to replace its draft Bill with one that satisfied the Opposition.
On Monday, apart from Mr Yadav, others present at the meeting included the CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury, the TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O'Brien, the CPI’s D. Raja, the RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, the JMM’s Sushil Kumar and the YSR Congress’s M. Rajamohan Reddy. The Congress was represented by Mr. Sharma and leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge. The leaders also met Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad in Parliament House.
The focus of their discussion was on steps to unitedly confront the government on the demonetisation move that had had caused great hardships to the common man. Other subjects discussed included the stalemate between the government and the judiciary that had resulted in many vacancies not being filled as well as the grave situation that farmers across the country were facing.

He said that the CPI (M) had already given notices in Parliament to suspend all business to discuss this issue. It was meaningful to meet even the President of India only after demanding the government's explanation in Parliament as soon as it met, he added. 
Declaring that he had told Ms. Banerjee that the CPI (M) had been opposing the decision from day one, Mr. Yechury told reporters that the government should allow the usage of the old currency for all public utilities and white transactions till December 31 or a few days before that, as the Kerala government had announced. 
He said the demonetisation decision would hit the poor the most. “Yesterday the PM asked people to give him 50 days. But people are dying as they can't pay for treatment. Allow people to use the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes at least in public utilities and for white transactions. The Kerala government has permitted it till December 21,” he said. “Why can't the country and other state governments wanting to protest do this?” 
Questioning the government's commitment to bringing back black money, he said: “Corruption will double with Rs. 2000 notes. Act against the corrupt. What did the government do after the Narada and Saradha scams, when people were caught on tape accepting cash?” 
He wondered how the BJP unit in Bengal could withdraw Rs. 3-crore just before the announcement. 
“Ban donations from corporates to political parties. Party spending in polls has no ceiling till now; only candidate spending has,” he said. 
Noting that counterfeits of the Rs. 2000 note were already available in the market, Mr. Yechury refused to accept the argument that counterfeit currency necessitated the demonetisation. “ISI Kolkata says that out of the demonetised currency, just 0.028 per cent is counterfeit currency.” He added that terror funding, too, was done through electronic transfers and not through bagfulls of cash. 
“In 2014, the Prime Minister said 90-percent of the black money was lying in foreign banks. The government has 600 names from Swiss banks. They aren't making these public,” Mr. Yechury said. “While there are huge bank NPAs because of large corporates, the government decided to forgo Rs. 1.12-lack crores last year. While there has been a 26-percent increase in farmers' suicides since Mr. Modi became PM, there is no relief to them.”

2016-11-14 15:54:00,Demonetisation: Subramanian Swamy blames FinMin for ‘lack of preparedness’," BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday criticised the Finance Ministry alleging “lack of preparedness” in dealing with the demonetisation of two high-value currencies and said the Ministry not being in loop of decision-making is “no excuse”.
“I am appalled by the lack of preparation... We have been in power for nearly two-and-a-half years. The Finance Ministry should have prepared for this from the very first day. It is easy to argue that the Ministry was not in the loop, but that is no excuse for not having a contingency plan,” Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post daily quoted Mr. Swamy as saying.
Mr. Swamy is currently in Hong Kong and will deliver a talk on anti-corruption efforts in India at the Foreign Correspondents Club on November 15, 2016.
The Harvard-educated economist further said, “Ad-hoc roadside kiosks should have been set up for all and special kiosks organised for senior citizens. All these should have been planned as part of a contingency plan.”
The Rajya Sabha member, who had consistently attacked former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and had also taken potshots at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, said, “The previous government gave the contract for currency paper to the same London-based company that supplies currency paper to Pakistan, helping Pakistan counterfeit Indian notes and finance militancy in India at zero cost.”
Asked why the government is yet to book anybody with foreign accounts, he replied, “That question has to be directed at the Finance Ministry, not me. I have no clue why nothing has been done.”
On Sunday, Mr. Jaitley had regretted hardships caused due to withdrawal of high denomination notes, but advised the public to be patient as the move will have larger benefits for the economy in the long term.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Subramanian-Swamy-blames-FinMin-for-%E2%80%98lack-of-preparedness%E2%80%99/article16389187.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-14 14:02:00,"Demonetisation has equalised the rich and the poor, claims Modi","As he stressed that the poor strongly backed his decision to demonetise high denomination currency, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday questioned the moral authority of his political opponents, especially the Congress, in criticising his step as anti-poor and anti-common man.
He invoked the Emergency days under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, accusing the Congress of enforcing it to only “save Ms. Gandhi’s seat.” In contrast, Mr. Modi asserted, his decision to scrap notes of high denomination was taken in the “interest and happiness of the poor,” the good of the country and the farmer.
''The Congress is worried about people. They enforced Emergency and turned this nation into a jail for 19 months. They restrained newspapers and arrested people who spoke up. Did you do this to fight corruption and the welfare of people? You did it only to save the throne of your PM, Indira Gandhi,” Mr. Modi said.
Addressing a parivartan rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur a day after his speech in Goa, Mr. Modi reiterated his appeal to people to lend him time, 50 days, and patience to complete the “big task,” a “mahayagna of honesty,” of unearthing black money. A door-to-door operation against black money would have taken years, he observed and stressed that he was left with only “one solution”— scrapping notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000.
As he tried to justify his decision as ‘pro-poor,’ he said the demonetisation had equalised the rich and the poor. His government stood “for the poor, the villages and the farmers.” “India has no shortage of wealth but where is this wealth stored that is a problem. There is little where it is supposed to be, and it is horded at places where it should not be.”
Mr. Modi, addressing his first rally in the poll-bound State after the mega overhaul, acknowledged that the common citizen faced hardship due to it. He said he could “experience the suffering” of the “average honest citizen” and was staying up all night, using his “mind and power” to reduce the hardship and would continue to do so.

'Bear the distress for larger good'

Urging people to bear the distress for a few days, he equated the situation as similar to a family’s tolerance of the lingering odour of wall paint for the larger good of decorating the house for a marriage. There is some discomfort in everything you do, only the “intention behind it must be well-meaning,” he said to assuage the anxiety of common people whose lives have been sent for a toss due to the crisis in supply of legal tender. Mr. Modi then referred to his own background as a tea-seller to further push the ‘pro-poor card.’ “My decision is a little kadak (strong) like my chai. When I was a child, the poor would especially ask me to make kadak chai (strong tea). The poor is fond of kadak chai. I have a habit since childhood of making kadak chai. The kadak tea suits the poor but warps the expression of the rich,” the Prime Minister said to loud cheers.
Even as observers debate the impact of the decision on Uttar Prades polls, a few months away, Mr. Modi credited the role of the State in his fight against corruption by helping his party win a full majority at the Centre in 2014. “It is the power of your vote that the poor is sleeping peacefully and the rich is running around the bazaar to buy sleeping pills.”
While targeting his opponents for criticising the demonetisation, Mr. Modi wondered why they were so worried by it. Meanwhile, on the ground, the BJP has been propagating that the BSP and the SP will be worst hit by a fund crunch due to the scrapping of notes.
Mr. Modi took a veiled dig at BSP chief Mayawati, who has condemned the demonetisation as an “undeclared financial emergency,” raking up the “garland of notes” she received in the past on her birthday.

Modi's poser to Congress

In a departure from his teary-eyed address in Goa, an aggressive PM mocked the Congress for asking under which law he had scrapped the notes, while reminding them of their decision to do away with the 25 paise.
“What law did you apply then? Who did you ask? It’s another matter you cannot think beyond the 25 paise. You did something of your stature, we did something of ours,” Mr. Modi said.
As he raised the pitch, the PM dared “all leaders misleading the people in the name of honesty” to show guts and publicly declare “if notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000, corruption, black money and dishonesty should continue?”
Further reaching out the sensibility of the poor, Mr. Modi claimed he apprehended a threat to himself, as he his act had hurt the interests of the powerful. “I know what I will have to face because those whose coffers are full are powerful. They can buy governments and even bring them down. They can destroy fates of the best of us. But tell me, shall I be frightened of such people, and leave the path of honesty?""
Amid reports of fake currency notes found floating in the Ganga at various locations in the State, Mr. Modi attacked those hoarding money, saying, “You sinners! Your sins will not be washed away by immersing notes in the Ganga.”
While accusing Pakistan of supplying fake currency to support Naxalism and terrorism in India, he asked, “Should we allow the enemies to make their move? I ask the leaders, in the fight against terrorism and Naxalism, should we not terminate fake currency?”
Mr. Modi recalled the promise he made to the people during the Lok Sabha elections that he would fight corruption, saying his step was only an attempt to fulfill it. “Should I not do what you asked me to do, end corruption? Am I not doing your work if I scrap notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000? When the villagers are ready to face such hardships, it shows there is no place for the dishonest in India.”
Mr. Modi also accused his opponents of instigating household women through “rumours that he had taken away all their savings for their daughter’s marriages."" He assured them they would not be bothered by the IT department. “My mothers and sisters, till your brother [Modi], is alive, you must be assured that no government officer will be put an eye on your hard-saved money.”",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-has-equalised-the-rich-and-the-poor-claims-Modi/article16447877.ece,LUCKNOW
2016-11-14 13:58:00,Demonetisation: Modi says the poor are with him,"As he stressed that the poor strongly backed his decision to demonetise currency notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday questioned the moral authority of his political opponents, especially the Congress, in criticising his step as anti-poor and anti-common man. 
He invoked the Emergency days under former PM Indira Gandhi, accusing the Congress of enforcing it to only “save Ms. Gandhi’s seat.”  In contrast, Mr. Modi asserted, his decision to scrap notes of high demonetisation was taken in the “interest and happiness of the poor,” the good of the country and the farmer.
 ''The Congress is worried about people. They enforced Emergency and turned this nation into a jail for 19 months. They restrained newspapers and arrested people who spoke up. Did you do this to fight corruption and the welfare of people?  You did it only to save the throne of your PM, Indira Gandhi,” Mr. Modi said.
Addressing a parivartan rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur a day after his emotional speech in Goa, the PM reiterated his appeal to people to lend him time, 50 days, and patience to complete the “big task,” a “mahayagna of honesty,” of unearthing black money. He hinted that a door-to-door operation against black money would have taken years and stressed he was left with only “one solution,"" — scrapping notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000.
As he tried to justify his decision as ‘pro-poor,’ and gather public support, he said the demonetisation had equalised the rich and the poor. His government stood for the “for the poor, the villages and the farmers.” “India has no shortage of wealth but where is this wealth stored that is a problem. There is little where it is supposed to be, and it is hoarded at places where it should not be.”
The PM, addressing his first rally in poll-bound UP after the mega overhaul, acknowledged the common citizen faced hardship due to the sudden scrapping of high denomination notes. He said he could “experience the suffering” of the “average honest citizen” and was staying up all night, using his “mind and power” to reduce the hardship and would continue to do so.  
He promised he would not allow the “money of the poor to be looted.”  
Urging people to bear the distress for a few days, he equated the situation as similar to a family’s tolerance of the pungent smell of wall paint for the larger good of decorating the house for a marriage.  There is discomfort in whatever you do, only the “intention behind it must be well-meaning,” he said, to assuage the anxiety of common people whose lives have been sent for a toss due to the crisis in supply of legal tender.
Pushing the point, Mr. Modi referred to his own background as a tea-seller. “My decision is kadak (strong). When I was a child, the poor would especially ask me to make kadak chai. The poor is fond of kadak chai. I have a habit since childhood of making kadak chai. The kadak tea suits the poor but warps the expression of the rich,” the PM said.
Mr. Modi also hailed the role of the State in his fight against corruption by helping his party win a full majority at the Centre. “It is the power of your vote that the poor is sleeping peacefully and the rich is running around the bazaar to buy sleeping pills.”
Targeting his opponents for criticising his move, Mr. Modi wondered why they were so worried by the scrapping of high-denomination currency.  He took a veiled dig at BSP chief Mayawati, who has condemned the demonetisation as an “undeclared financial emergency,” raking up the “garland of notes” she receive in the past on her birthday.
In a departure from his teary-eyed address in Goa, the PM disparaged the Congress for asking under which law he had scrapped the notes, reminding them of previous Congress government’s decision to do away with the 25 paise. “What law did you apply then? Whom did you ask? It is another matter you cannot think beyond the 25 paise. You did something of your level, while we worked according to our level,” Mr. Modi said.
The PM dared “all leaders misleading the people in the name of honesty” to show guts and publicly declare “if notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, corruption, black money and dishonesty should continue?”
Mr. Modi asked people if he should be frightened by powerful forces hurt by his decision, even as he reiterated he would have to face consequences for it.  “I know what I will have to face because those whose coffers are full are powerful. They can buy governments and even bring them down. They can destroy fates of the best of us. But tell me, shall I be frightened of such people, and leave the path of honesty?"" he said.
Amid reports of old currency notes found floating in the Ganga at various locations, Mr. Modi attacked those hoarding money, saying, “You sinners! Your sins will not be washed away by immersing notes in the Ganga.” While accusing Pakistan of supplying fake currency to support Naxalims and terrorism in India, he asked, “Should we allow the enemies to make their move? I ask the leaders in the fight against terrorism and Naxalism, should we not terminate fake currency?”
Mr. Modi recalled the promise he made to the people during the Lok Sabha elections that he would fight corruption. “Should I not do what you asked me to do, end corruption? Am I not doing your work if I scrap notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000?  Will you face the hardships and suffering that come with it? When the villagers are ready to face such hardships, there is no place for the dishonest in India.”
Minutes before the rally, the PM, accompanied by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and his colleague and local MP, Manoj Sinha, flagged off the new Shabd Bhedi Express Train between Ghazipur and Kolkata and laid the foundation stone of the Ghazipur-Ganga rail bridge, a demand from the time of Nehru. Mr. Modi said he deliberately picked November 14, the first prime minister’s birthday, to launch the projects to highlight the Congress’ indifference towards impoverished Purvanchal.
 “I deliberately picked November 14 to come here, so that on his birthday people who are misleading people know that from 1962 to 2016 you did not turn an eye to the region. Wherever your soul rests, Panditji, the aspirations of these poor people were locked away in papers and files after you went away. Even if your party and family throws false allegations on me, on your birthday I want to finish that incomplete work.”
Mr. Modi invoked Nehru referring to an emotional speech made in Parliament in 1962 by Ghazipur ‘s then MP Vishwanath Gahmari to draw the then PM’s attention to the abject poverty of Purvanchal.  Consequently, Nehru had formed the Patel Committee, which outlined the necessary developments needed in the region. However, nothing came of it, Mr. Modi lamented.  “PMs came and went. I am the ninth from the State but nothing happened of that report,” Mr . Modi said as he pitched his government’s crop insurance scheme, AIIMS and fertilizers plants in Gorakhpur as “honest thought” towards the development of the region, among the most backward in the country. 
Mr. Modi also accused his opponents of instigating household women through “rumours that he had taken away all their savings for their daughter’s marriages,” while assuring them they would not be bothered by the IT department.  “My mothers and sisters, till your brother [Modi], is alive, you must be assured that no government officer will be put an eye on your hard-saved money. Deposit your money without any worry. My government will even provide you interest for the marriage of your child. The Income Tax department will not bother you at all about your Rs 2.5 lakh. But should I spare those who with Rs 2.5 crore, those who hide stacks of notes under their bed and gunny bags?''

The meeting at Prime Minister’s residence was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, I&B Minister Venkaiah Naidu, Power, Coal and Mines Minister Piyush Goyal and top officials of the Finance ministry.
The meeting came amid continuing chaos and growing public anger across the country over limited cash availability following the surprise demonetisation of two higher value currency notes by Modi.
There was little respite for cash-starved people queueing up outside banks and ATMs on Sunday, with branches witnessing unprecedented rush since early morning and leading to arguments and scuffles.
Earlier in the evening, after a review by Finance ministry, the limit of old and now defunct Rs 500 and Rs 1000 rupee notes that can be exchanged for freshly minted Rs 2000 and new Rs 500 notes was increased from Rs 4000 to Rs 4500 per day.
Cash withdrawal limit at ATMs was hiked to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,000 a day.

But those sitting outside the temples for alms are clueless on exchanging these obsolete notes as they do not have Aadhaar or any other identity cards. 
“Whatever little savings we have made are in the form of some higher denomination notes to fall back during health and other emergencies,” say a group of beggars waiting outside the Siva temple at Chennakeshavaswamipet here.
The shopkeepers selling puja material including coconuts and flowers are also in an uneviable position as most of the devotees come with either obsolete ₹ 500 or ₹1,000 notes or the newly-introduced ₹ 2,000 notes. “As a result, we are finding it too difficult to do business since Wednesday,” complained a shopkeeper Sridevi outside the Santhapeta Sai Baba temple..

Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has called the customary all-party meet on Monday.
Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee spoke to President Mukherjee over phone on the issue, and tweeted that she had briefed him about how common people are suffering because of demonetisation. I thank him for agreeing to meet representatives of political parties on November 16 or 17 when we will brief him in detail over the grim situation.”
The Trinamool Congress, Ms. Banerjee’s party, seems to have taken the lead in opposing demonetisation, with its Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien sending a notice for a discussion on the issue in the Upper House.

2016-11-14 01:04:00,Demonetisation: Business correspondents under pressure ," With the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 notes, the Business Correspondents (BCs) of the banks “are under pressure”. They are facing challenges such as non-availability of cash and UV lamps to detect counterfeit notes.
The Central government allowed the BCs to exchange notes up to Rs. 4000 per person against valid identity proofs and requisition slips. But a majority of the banks could not provide enough cash to them.
Many banks, industry sources say, focus more on urban areas. Their attention is more on exchange of old notes and replenishment of cash in the ATMs in cities and towns leading to problems for the BCs. The banks have begun distributing cash to them on Saturday, sources say. “They are doing a good job. But they are under pressure,” said an SBI official, who did not want to be named. 
Another major reason is the norm that a BC is not supposed to hold more than Rs. 50,000. Even if a BC does a business over and above the cash holding limit, he or she has to deposit it with the bank branch concerned. So, the BC has to run to the bank as soon as he touches Rs. 50,000 business and return to his village to continue the transactions.
“There is not much inconvenience. The BCs are remitting the amount in branches attached to them after 10 to 15 transactions have been done. There is pressure on branches also,” said a senior official of Andhra Bank.
Some banks like the Indian Bank conducted a training session to the BCs on the modalities and precautions. The BCs had been told to maintain separate registers containing names and other details of account holders exchanging the notes. “This will help them in zeroing in on the person who might deposit counterfeit notes,” said an Indian Bank official.
There are around 6,500 BCs working for various banks in AP. About half of 1,800 BCs of the Andhra Bank are located in AP alone. There are about 8,000 sub-service areas, meaning they do not sustain a brick-and-mortar branch. Therefore, banks chose BCs as the next possible alternative to serve the people there.
A majority of the banks haven’t provided UV lamps and machines to detect the counterfeit notes. ",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-Business-correspondents-under-pressure/article16379801.ece,VIJAYAWADA

2016-11-14 23:45:00,Demonetisation takes the fizz out of property sales ," The impact of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes is being felt in the real estate sector, which recorded around 40 per cent slump in transaction in Mysuru. 
The worst hit is the sale and resale of plots, which entails high volume of cash, unlike the sale of built or ready-to-occupy apartments that are loan-based. A dip in transactions was seen when the demonetisation move was announced on Tuesday night, said senior sub-registrar of Mysuru South M. Vivek. 
He told The Hindu that the slump in the Mysuru south office was about 15 per cent but it was as high as 40 per cent in three other sub-registrar offices in the city. “Against the average 40 site registrations per day in the Mysuru South office, the figures have come down by 15 per cent and there is a dip in high-value transactions,” he added. However, there was a property registration of Rs. 8.9 crore during this period, Mr. Vivek said.
Between Wednesday and Friday, the revenue earned was around Rs.1.3 crore in the Mysuru south office. However, stakeholders, including builders, aver that the slump in real estate transaction was higher. A prominent real estate agent, also into writing deeds, said transactions and registration of sites are down by 50 per cent and only properties with bank loans are being registered. “The scenario will prevail till March 2017 and real estate value will crash further to benefit commoners,” he said.
The real estate market in Mysuru was already stagnating and hence, unless there is a distress sale, sellers are expected to hold on to their property to create an artificial scarcity in the long run, according to him. 
However, the Builders Association of India, Mysuru centre, averred that purchase of flats and apartments by the salaried class has not been affected as funding is through loan. Demonetisation will mostly impact sale of sites, BAI said. 
But, there is a perception that sale of high-end luxury apartments and properties will be affected. 
Ongoing projects in Mysuru are set to overrun their deadline owing to demonetisation. Leading builders have scaled down their labour force as they are unable to pay them daily wages. Mahesh, a civil engineer who owns a own construction firm, told The Hindu that he has scaled down the labour force from nearly 150 to 50 per day. “This is a temporary arrangement to beat the liquidity crunch,” he added. 
Meanwhile, BAI members say demonetisation on real estate will benefit genuine end-users as they can expect a price correction with land value falling by about 30 per cent in the long run. “Cash flow has been blocked and unaccounted money cannot be exchanged without raising suspicion,” said Ravindra Bhat of BAI. 
He said there was another welcome development. Small-time developers, who fund their projects through informal sources, most of which is untaxed, will be out of business and this will curb the entry of black money, he said.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Demonetisation-takes-the-fizz-out-of-property-sales/article16401832.ece,MYSURU

Shankarappa V.H., a milk vendor visited a branch of a private bank at Savalanga Road with his daughter Sinchana S.S., a first PU student. He told The Hindu that the ceiling imposed on withdrawal had affected his business badly. As his daughter had a holiday, he had brought her to the bank to withdraw some money from her account too to be able to meet the financial needs of his business.
Sunil Kumar Jain, who runs a wholesale business of paper plates and cups, said business activities have faced serious setbacks owing to the ceiling imposed on cash withdrawals. As commercial establishments in the Central Business District in the city will be closed on Sunday, he had came to the bank to withdraw cash to meet his family’s daily expenses.
Basavaraj, a student from Belagavi, pursuing engineering at a private college in the city, heaved sigh of relief after exchanging demonetised currency with new notes at a nationalised bank on B.H. Road in the city. He said that after the announcement to withdraw the old notes, he faced many problems as the demonetised currency at his disposal was not being accepted at restaurants and grocery shops. “I could not even get study material photocopied,” he said. “I could not exchange the notes as I used to be in college during banking hours. The delay in commencement of the functioning of ATMs worsened the problem,” he added.
Meanwhile, most ATM kiosks remained non-functional in the city on Sunday too. Y. Dilipkumar Reddy, serving as manager with Allahabad Bank, said the completion of the process of calibration of ATMs for new currency required time.
At some banks, the service of exchange of demonetised notes for non-customers was suspended from 2 p.m. Rajesh A.C., manager, Karnataka Bank, said that owing to paucity of cash, there were interruptions in some banks in the exchange of currency notes.
In the wake of the incident of theft of cash from a woman standing in the queue at a nationalised bank reported on Friday, police personnel were deployed as a security measure at banks that saw a large number of customers.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Students-working-professionals-make-use-of-Sunday-to-exchange-demonetised-notes/article16379520.ece,Shivamogga
2016-11-14 00:00:00,Demonetisation hits students hard,"Students from professional colleges, who have come to the State from different parts of the country, are facing a cash crunch because of the Union government’s decision to demonetise currency in the denominations of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500.
These students do not have cash on hand nor are they able to withdraw money from ATM kiosks, as most of the machines are not functioning in Hassan city. The students have been forced to take loans from friends, shopkeepers or distant relatives.
Hundreds of students from Malnad College of Engineering on Salagame Road in Hassan, belong to far off places. They have opened savings bank accounts into which their families send money regularly.

Daily expenses

“My father had sent me money earlier this month. I withdrew the money and paid it to our house owner for rent. Now I need money for my daily expenses, that include food, travel and study material. I do not have any cash on hand and none of the ATMs near the college are working. I don’t know what to do,” said Ullas K., from Dakshina Kannada, who is in his final semester of B.E.

Rent returned

Pramod and Karthik, two other students, who are also roommates, are facing a problem too. They had borrowed money and cleared the rent in the first week of the month. “We paid our rent with Rs. 500 notes well before they were withdrawn. Now, the owner has returned the money and is asking us to pay the rent in Rs. 100 notes, said Pramod, also a B.E. student.
Except for a few ATM kiosks in the core area of Hassan city, all were closed even on Sunday. The students were seen moving from one ATM to another to check if cash had been loaded into the machines. Wherever cash was filled, the queue was long.

Loans

With no option left, students are approaching shopkeepers near the college to borrow a few hundred rupees as loans. An owner of a stationery shop near the college said he had loaned about Rs. 5,000 to students in the last three days.

2016-11-14 00:26:00,Demonetisation hits students hard in Hassan," Students from professional colleges, who have come to the State from different parts of the country, are facing a cash crunch because of the Union government’s decision to demonetise currency in the denominations of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500. 
These students do not have cash on hand nor are able to withdraw money from ATM kiosks, as most of the machines are not functioning in Hassan city. The students have been forced to take loans from friends, shopkeepers or distant relatives.
Hundreds of students from Malnad College of Engineering on Salagame Road in Hassan, belong to far off places. They have opened savings bank accounts into which their families send money regularly. “My father had sent me money earlier this month. I withdrew the money and paid it to our house owner for rent. Now I need money for my daily expenses, that include food, travel and study material. I do not have any cash on hand and none of the ATMs near the college are working. I don’t know what to do,” said Ullas K., from Dakshina Kannada, who is in his final semester of B.E..
Pramod and Karthik, two other students, who are also roommates, are facing a problem too. They had borrowed money and cleared the rent in the first week of the month. “We paid our rent with Rs. 500 notes well before they were withdrawn. Now, the owner has returned the money and is asking us to pay the rent in Rs. 100 notes, said Pramod, also a B.E. student.
Except for a few ATM kiosks in the core area of Hassan city, all were closed even on Sunday. The students were seen moving from one ATM to another to check if cash had been loaded into the machines. Wherever cash was filled, the queue was long. 
Loans
With no option left, students are approaching shopkeepers near the college to borrow a few hundred rupees as loans. An owner of a stationery shop near the college said he had loaned about Rs. 5,000 to students in the last three days. 
“They are all my regular customers. Some wanted Rs. 200 to Rs. 500. As they were out of options, they approached me for loans and I helped them,” said the shopkeeper.

2016-11-14 00:00:00,Many throng banks to exchange demonetised notes,"On Sunday, the first holiday after announcement of the decision to demonetise currency of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination, a number of working professionals, students and businesspersons thronged banks in the city in large numbers to avail new notes by surrendering the demonetised notes at their disposal and to withdraw cash from their accounts.
Shankarappa V.H., a milk vendor visited a branch of a private bank at Savalanga Road with his daughter Sinchana S.S., a first PU student. He told The Hindu that the ceiling imposed on withdrawal had affected his business badly. As his daughter had a holiday, he had brought her to the bank to withdraw some money from her account too to be able to meet the financial needs of his business.

Severe setback

Sunil Kumar Jain, who runs a wholesale business of paper plates and cups, said business activities have faced serious setbacks owing to the ceiling imposed on cash withdrawals. As commercial establishments in the Central Business District in the city will be closed on Sunday, he had came to the bank to withdraw cash to meet his family’s daily expenses.
Basavaraj, a student from Belagavi, pursuing engineering at a private college in the city, heaved sigh of relief after exchanging demonetised currency with new notes at a nationalised bank on B.H. Road in the city. He said that after the announcement to withdraw the old notes, he faced many problems as the demonetised currency at his disposal was not being accepted at restaurants and grocery shops. “I could not even get study material photocopied,” he said. “I could not exchange the notes as I used to be in college during banking hours. The delay in commencement of the functioning of ATMs worsened the problem,” he added.

Non-functioning ATMs

Meanwhile, most ATM kiosks remained non-functional in the city on Sunday too. Y. Dilipkumar Reddy, serving as manager with Allahabad Bank, said the completion of the process of calibration of ATMs for new currency required time.
At some banks, the service of exchange of demonetised notes for non-customers was suspended from 2 p.m. Rajesh A.C., manager, Karnataka Bank, said that owing to paucity of cash, there were interruptions in some banks in the exchange of currency notes.

Briefing reporters about the decisions of a UDF leadership meet here on Monday, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and other UDF leaders said the decision has caused severe hardships to the people, especially marginalised sections such as farmers and migrant labourers.
 As the Sabarimala pilgrimage begins on Tuesday, the pilgrims may find the going tough. The UDF would cooperate with all steps taken by the State government to mitigate the woes of the public. UDF leaders would meet Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on November 17 and discuss the issue. It would also observe November 17 as black day, he said. 
The meeting demanded that the State government open a control room at the Secretariat and similar facility at Collectorates with toll free numbers so that the public could seek assistance in the event of an emergency.
While the public were looking forward to an immediate solution to the crisis, Mr.Modi’s statement that they would have to wait for 50 days has heightened their anxiety. Deepening the crisis, the Centre has also slashed the rice and wheat quota to the State for the beneficiaries on the priority list, he said.
There were reports that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership were privy to the decision to scrap the currency. If the reports are true, it warrants a probe. BJP leader Ram Madhav has defamed the people of Kerala by saying that the State was a centre of hawala transactions, he said.
There was a move to destabilise the cooperative sector in Kerala and this was aimed at helping the commercial banks and the corporate rich, he said.

2016-11-14 00:00:00,Demonetisation hits plantation workers in Yercaud,"Even while the demonetisation has led to sharp fall in the arrival of tourists to Yercaud, it has also hit a large number of plantation workers employed in the big and small estates on the hill station.
The non-availability of adequate currency of lower denomination, absence of adequate bank branches for the exchange of the scrapped currency and the non-functioning of the ATMs have hit the plantation workers in the form of non-disbursement of wages.
Yercaud accounts for 67 tribal villages with a majority of the population employed as daily wagers in the coffee estates. The hill station has five bank branches and six ATMs. With ATMs not functioning, the queues at the bank branches are getting longer day by day.
The plantation workers are paid wages once a week. With the government restricting the withdrawal to Rs. 10,000 and exchange limit to Rs. 4,000, the estate owners are not in a position to disburse small denomination currency to them.
V. K. Nallamuthu, general secretary of the Indian Trade Union Congress (INTUC), while welcoming the initiative of the government, said its execution without proper planning had caused untold hardship to people.
The workers and their families, who mainly depend on the wages for the day to day expenses, were badly hit. They were at present forced to approach money lenders, he added.
With only a few big hotels accepting online transaction, the arrival of tourists here has decreased and the rooms in small hotels remained vacant.
Mr. Nallamuthu pleaded with the banks to rush adequate lower denomination currency to the hill station, open more counters for the exchange of currency and make all the ATMs operational.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-hits-plantation-workers-in-Yercaud/article16444780.ece,SALEM

In wake of demonetisation, the SIT had recommended thorough analysis of bank accounts receiving huge deposits and other bank accounts in which money disproportionate to average transactions would be deposited.
Precaution should be taken so that jewellery shops would not absorb black money by way of purchase of ornaments, it had said.
“We have also drawn the attention of Union Finance Minister highlighting the problem being faced by common people. We have asked him to take steps so that inconvenience faced by people does not linger further,” said Justice Pasayat.

According to a press release from the CII, “After a short period of some pain when the economy adjusts to the sudden withdrawal of cash, the CII expects a much stronger economy.” The prevalence of cash use had made India prone to high inflation. India’s cash dependence is extremely high with a currency-GDP ratio of nearly 12 per cent compared to four per cent to five per cent in other developing countries. High level of cash usage tends to slow down the flow of money through the economy. Lower cash use will have a dampening impact on inflation and this will be a positive for India’s macro fundamentals. 
Deposit mobilisation of banks will be strengthened and this will increase the liquidity for banks. “For the industry, this is indeed a historic and welcome move with very positive implications. It will prevent people from violating the law with impunity even for daily business transactions,” the CII said. 
K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, says the inconvenience faced by the public is temporary.

I would try to meet and urge him to extend the date of scrapping of such notes and increase cash exchange amount at banks from the present Rs 4,000 limit.”

This time, however, the government has withdrawn Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, which account for over 85 per cent of the money, causing all sections of society being hit hard.


It didn’t matter to us. We never had those notes; we didn’t feel the




need for it

2016-11-14 00:00:00,Demonetisation hits fishing industry hard,"The demonetisation of Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 currency notes has affected the fishing industry. Fishing operations have come to a grinding halt since Saturday.
Edmund Thennavan, president, Tamil Nadu Fishermen Association, said not only fishing operations but its allied industries such as ice manufacturing and logistics had been affected.
Before announcing the demonetisation move, the government should have given a breather to the public. Though the Centre had targeted black money holders, common people should not have been made to suffer like this, he said.
J. Ashok, a fisherman, said his fish netted a couple of days ago remained unsold because of this sudden move. Many fishermen were helpless without cash.
This situation had led to fall in seafood prices.
Fish sold for Rs.500 before demonetisation were being sold for Rs. 300 now.
Since traders were not willing to procure fish, they were pushed to the local market vendors at a lesser price.
S. Xavier Vas, president, Thoothukudi Mechanised Boat Owners’ Association, said boat owners had been facing hardship as every boat required Rs.1.40 lakh for a sailing day to meet the expenses on diesel, oil, ice bars and labour.
Since there was a ceiling on withdrawal of cash from banks, the required money could not be withdrawn.
Hence, there was no other alternative but to suspend fishing. It had resulted in a loss of Rs.2 crore in foreign exchange to the government every day since seafood exports had been affected, he said.
The local economy, which was largely based on the fishing industry, in Thoothukudi remained affected.
As many as 230 mechanised boats remained anchored at the fishing harbour here.
It was not certain whether fishing would resume on Monday, he said.
R. Raj, secretary, Thoothukudi Country Boat Fishermen Association, said seafood auctioneers had been asked to procure seafood after paying one-fourth of the old currency notes, which were demonetised, and the rest with fresh currency notes until November-end. However, country boat fishermen would continue fishing, he said.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-hits-fishing-industry-hard/article16445111.ece,THOOTHUKUDI
2016-11-14 00:00:00,Demonetisation hits Snehasparsam,"The scarcity of bank notes caused by demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes has had an adverse effect on the fund collection for the Snehasparsam Project of Kozhikode District Panchayat’s Kidney Patients Welfare Society, held on Sunday.
Though the organisers had announced willingness to accept the nullified notes, most people were not willing to give up the notes of lower denominations, said Snehasparsam project coordinator Sreeraj N.
“We had started campaigning months ago and had conducted door-to-door canvassing many times. But the demonetisation was an unexpected hurdle that we could not overcome since it came at the last moment,” he said.
The fund collection was held in all the 70 panchayats in the district and the municipalities other than Ramanattukara and Vadakara on Sunday. Though there was a provision to deposit online into the Snehasparsam account, the outcome was low since online banking is not very popular in the rural areas. “Many people did not have money with them as they were either jobless or had not received payment from their employers due to scarcity of currency,” Mr. Sreeraj said.
On the other hand, there were people who had set aside the sum for Snehasparsam much before the demonetisation came into effect.
“The neighbourhood groups that had contributed up to Rs.27,000 last year had only collected up to Rs.7,000 this time,” he said.
The organisers are expecting the financial crisis to be toned down by November 27 when the fund collection is to take place in Kozhikode Corporation, Vadagara and Ramanattukara municipalities. An executive meeting of the society to be held on Monday will discuss whether the collection in rural areas has to be extended, Mr. Sreeraj added.",Kozhikode,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/Demonetisation-hits-Snehasparsam/article16444836.ece,Kozhikode
2016-11-14 00:00:00,"Madurai Bench, first to decide on demonetisation","The nation is yet to recover from jitters sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise address to the people on Tuesday announcing demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, but the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has already created history by being the first in the country to hear, deliberate and dismiss a case against the Centre’s move that has earned both bouquets and brickbats.
However, what made the Madurai Bench reject the case was a decision of the Supreme Court taken on August 9, 1996 by a four-judge Bench of Justices M.K. Mukherjee, Kuldip Singh, M.M. Punchhi, and N.P. Singh upholding the Constitutional validity of the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 enacted during the Prime Ministership of Morarji Desai to demonetise Rs. 1,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10,000 currencies.
Section 2 (d) of the Act defined the term ‘high denomination bank notes’ to mean the three currency notes and Section 3 declared that on expiry of January 16, 1978 all high-denomination notes would, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, ceased to be legal tender in payment or on account at any place.
Section 4 of the Act prohibited transfer and receipt of the currencies from the specified date.
Assailing the Act, the petitioners before the Supreme Court had contended that it violated their fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 19 (1) (f) and 31 of the Constitution. While the first Article recognised the right to acquire any property by lawful means, hold it and dispose of it freely, limited only by reasonable restrictions, the second Article provided that the State could acquire private property for a public purpose only on payment of compensation to the owner.
Since Section 26 of the RBI Act cast a duty upon the bank to honour the obligation of accepting currencies issued by it as legal tender, it was contended that the Demonetisation Act extinguished the debts due from the RBI to the holders of high denomination notes and that such extinguishment of debts amounted to compulsory acquisition of property without payment of compensation which was mandatory under Article 31(2) of the Constitution.
Rejecting the arguments, the apex court said the contention based on Article 19(1)(f ) was “wholly misconceived for after compulsory acquisition of their property by the impugned Act, the petitioners’ right thereto stood extinguished and consequently the question of reasonable restriction to the exercise or enjoyment of a right, which became non est, could not arise”.
On the issue of compensating the holders of demonetised bank notes, the court said: “Equally untenable is the petitioners’ contention that they were deprived of their right to get compensation for such acquisition as Sections 7 and 8 of the Demonetisation Act lay down an elaborate procedure to apply for and obtain an equal value of the high denomination bank notes in the manner prescribed thereunder.”
Taking a cue from that judgement, the Madurai Bench held:
“Now Article 19(1)(f) is no more in force. Therefore, as of now, right to own property is no more a fundamental right. Similarly, Article 31 also stands supplemented by certain other provisions introduced.
When the Honourable Supreme Court had declared that demonetisation of currency notes did not violate Article 19(1)(f), it is difficult for us to hold that it offends any other fundamental right.”
A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran also went on to state that the present petitioner who had challenged the recent decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had not made out any case, even prima facie, to show that the Finance Ministry’s notification under challenge was either illegal, irrational or it suffered from procedural impropriety or proportionality for the court to exercise judicial review.
On the issue of hardship caused to the common man due to the sudden move, the judges said:
“Of course, it is true that it has caused some inconvenience. As expressed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, in his address to the nation, it is not as though the Government was not aware of these possible inconvenience or hardship to the common man and the poor people of this country.
“His Excellency, the President of India, who himself is a great scholar, economist and who had held the portfolio of finance for a considerable time, has issued a Press Note wherein His Excellency has welcomed the said action taken by the Central Government, which, according to him, will help to unearth unaccounted money as well as counterfeit currency.
“As it has been expressed by His Excellency the President of India and the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, we, the people of this country, should be hopeful that this measure would speed up the growth of the economy.... and it would free the country from corruption, black money, terrorism and other evils,” the judges concluded.

2016-11-15 14:37:00,"Demonetisation: Prachanda dials Modi, seeks help","Nepal Premier Prachanda has telephoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and sought an arrangement so that Nepalese holding a huge stock of banned high denomination Indian bank notes could swap them with legal currency in the country.
During his five-minute telephonic conversation with Mr. Modi, Mr. Prachanda told him that Nepalese have quite a big stock of Indian bank notes of 500 and 1,000 denominations that have now been pulled out of circulation.
Hundreds of thousands of Nepalese, who earn a living by working as daily-wage labourers in India, visit the neighbouring country seeking medical treatment or rely on Indian markets to purchase daily essentials, are said to be holding big chunk of scrapped Indian bank notes, Kathmandu Post reported.
Also, those visiting India as pilgrims and those engaged in cross-border trade are said to have a big stock of now-useless Indian bank notes.
Some of these people, according to the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, may lose their entire savings if the now-obsolete notes are not replaced with legal bills.
“Considering this, India should make an arrangement so that Nepalese can exchange the banned notes here in Nepal,” a statement posted on Mr. Prachanda’s personal website quoted the premier as saying.
In response, Mr. Modi said he would immediately resolve the issue and would also ask Finance Minister to hold talks with Nepalese counterpart.
Following the Indian government’s surprise decision, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank, also banned the use of those bank notes in Nepal from last Wednesday.
The NRB has said IRs 33.6 million in the denominations of 500 and 1,000 is within the financial system in Nepal, the report said.
The figure includes cash parked at vaults of banks, financial institutions and NRB.
But actual stock of banned Indian bank notes is expected to be much more because Nepalese were previously allowed to carry Indian 500 and 1,000-rupee bank notes worth up to IRs25,000, it said.
Also, those residing in areas bordering India usually stash Indian notes of larger denominations as they have to frequent Indian markets to buy goods.
The Indian government has said people who have accounts in Indian banks need not worry as the financial institutions will provide them the currency exchange facility. But many Nepalese who own the banned notes do not have accounts in Indian banks.
Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Indian Finance Ministry on Thursday requesting that arrangements be made so that Nepalese holding banned Indian notes could replace them with legal tenders here in Nepal.

2016-11-14 00:42:00,Demonetisation effect: Tourism sector takes a hit in Karnataka ," Buses running empty and hotels not having enough visitors even during what is considered the peak tourist season has become the norm ever since high-denomination notes were demonetised last week. The State tourism industry is reporting huge losses: while private tourist taxi operators estimate a 50 per cent drop in business, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and Karnataka State Hotels and Restaurants Association claim that business has dipped by 25 to 30 per cent over the last few days. 
Rajender Kumar Kataria, managing director, KSRTC, said direct bookings had dropped by 25 per cent. However, online ticket reservations have seen a drop of about 10 per cent. “During weekdays we get revenue of Rs. 7.25 crore, while weekends fetch us over Rs. 8 crore,” he said, and added that weekend business was down by Rs. 1 crore. 
During November and December, nearly 95 per cent of the KSRTC’s 8,400-odd fleet strength hits the road because of an increase in the number of tourists from and to Bengaluru. However, in the last few days, they have been operating fewer buses. “Usually during weekends over 25,000 tickets are booked from and to Bengaluru from places such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. This weekend, it dropped to 20,000,” Mr. Kataria said.
Meanwhile, R.K. Holla, president, Bangalore Tourist Taxi Operators’ Association, said that people were not able to withdraw money from ATMs because of which there had been a drastic drop in the number of tourists visiting hills stations and pilgrimage spots in Karnataka and the neighbouring States.
Mr. Holla explained that owing to the lack of cash, even drivers were reluctant to go on long trips. “All of them do not have bank accounts because of which they have have not been able to draw money to give change. Since the process of getting inter-State permit has not gone online still, they are not able to pay cash and get them. Besides, the drivers usually have food at roadside eateries that do not accept card payment. All these factors put together has impacted our business,” he said.
Checks on those making bulk bookings 
KSRTC managing director Rajender Kumar Kataria has instructed his staff to run checks on organisations making bulk bookings before accepting the order. Often, private and political parties book over 50 buses for functions. However, over the last 48 hours, KSRTC has received three such bulk bookings from organisations, and officials suspect that it’s a money laundering gimmick.
Such bulk bookings usually cost over Rs 1 crore. “For this, customers have to provide a deposit amount running to lakhs of rupees. This can be ‘black’ money and when they cancel it in a few days, we will have to return it,” said a KSRTC official.
To prevent this, the managing director has asked his staff to consult the head office before cancelling bulk bookings.",Bengaluru,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/Demonetisation-effect-Tourism-sector-takes-a-hit-in-Karnataka/article16379635.ece,BENGALURU

2016-11-15 21:25:00,CPI(M) attacks Centre on demonetisation ," A day before the winter session of Parliament begins, the CPI(M) attacked the Modi government and the BJP on demonetisation, “authoritarian tendencies” at the Centre and in BJP-ruled States and “communal polarisation.” 
“The withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes has led to total disruption of the payments and settlements system and has impacted all citizens in one way or the other,” a party release said on Tuesday. 
“In rural areas, the crisis is grave. Markets are closed in various places. People are unable to buy even bare essentials, life-saving medicines etc.”
The statement echoed party general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s view that the measure does not address black money, corruption, counterfeit currency notes and terror funding.
“Cash constitutes only six per cent of the black economy,” the release said. “... Also, the basic avenues for money laundering through participatory notes and diversions through tax havens remain untouched. There is no attempt to curb the roots of generation of black money such as in the real estate sector.”
“The Government of India/RBI should allow district and primary cooperative banks also to accept and exchange Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. This will provide much relief to people in the rural areas.”
The CPI(M) demanded that till alternative arrangements like the availability of required currency notes and the recalibration of ATM machines are completed, people should be allowed to transact in old notes.
The party termed signs of authoritarianism incidents such as the bid to slap a ban on NDTV India, the detention of Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and others while trying to meet family members of a retired Army man who committed suicide, the Delhi police action on JNU students protesting the disappearance of student Najeeb Ahmad after a dispute with the ABVP, murder charges against Delhi professors, a CPI(M) State leader and others in Chhattisgarh, and the encounter of eight alleged SIMI undertrials in Madhya Pradesh. 
“The Polit Bureau expressed concern over the escalating communal tension and consequent polarisation in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections,” the statement added. 
“The BJP and the RSS are vigorously pursuing this agenda through various outfits and propagating divisive issues like gau raksha etc,” the CPI(M) said. ",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/CPIM-attacks-Centre-on-demonetisation/article16433311.ece,NEW DELHI

""Tell us, instead of forcing citizens to stand in queues for his own money... and it is traumatic for people to stand in lines for hours doing nothing, why can't you raise their cash withdrawal limit to a reasonable limit?""

""Carpenters, masons, daily wage earners, maids vegetable sellers are dependent on cash; we are only wondering if you are capable of doing anything to reduce the trauma of ordinary man?"" Chief Justice Thakur asked Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi.

2016-11-15 02:12:00,Are demonetised notes striking gold?,"Financial investigation agencies have gathered prima facie evidence suggesting that a number of jewellers and foreign exchange operators in the country indulged in illicit conversion of demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.
The Customs Intelligence has zeroed in over 400 big jewellers in 25 cities on reports that soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation, they showed a sharp jump in sales. In the black market, the gold price had gone up to Rs. 50,000 for 10 grams.
In one case, a jeweller sold 201 kg of gold in just three days, leaving a minuscule balance in its coffers. His accounts are being scrutinised.
“We will share the findings with our sister agencies for necessary action. The Income Tax Department is keeping track of the transactions in question and has served notice,” said a senior Customs official. An estimated 2.5 million jewellers and half-a-million goldsmiths operate across the country.
The agencies suspect that several jewellery houses would show receipts in part payments below Rs.2 lakh per buyer to ensure that they do not have to produce their PAN to the authorities.
The jewellers usually deposit cash in banks every week after producing the transaction records.
If the investigators come across transactions revealing a trend on deliberate splitting of sales, an explanation will be sought from such jewellers.
Following an Enforcement Directorate crackdown on over 70 unscrupulous foreign exchange operators, an official said, such practices have stopped in Delhi. “Irregularities have been found in the transactions of several forex operators in some cities, which are being investigated further,” said the official.

Realty sales

The Income Tax Department is also conducting discreet inquiries on several real estate operators in different States, including Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
It is suspected that attempts are being made to push the unaccounted-for cash into the system by entering into land deals at highly inflated rates.
Reports of some mid-rung companies trying to adjust cash in their account books have also been received.
Besides, the department is gearing up to investigate the dormant accounts in which huge sums have reportedly been deposited after the demonetisation announcement.

After the meeting, Congress deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said, “There is broad consensus that the demonetisation issue should be raised in Parliament.”
However, with many leaders not available, the Opposition parties will meet again on Tuesday afternoon to finalise their plans. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party are busy campaigning for the Uttar Pradesh elections and the DMK, AIADMK, NCP and AAP were unrepresented on Monday. 
Janata Dal(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who was present at the meeting, told The Hindu, “We are hoping to build the sort of opposition unity that we had on the Land Acquisition Act.” The cohesion then had forced the Modi government to replace its draft Bill with one that satisfied the Opposition. 
On Monday, apart from Mr Yadav, others present at the meeting included the CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury, the TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O'Brien, the CPI’s D. Raja, the RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, the JMM’s Sushil Kumar and the YSR Congress’s M. Rajamohan Reddy. The Congress was represented by Mr. Sharma and leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge. The leaders also met Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad in Parliament House. 
The focus of their discussion was on steps to unitedly confront the government on the demonetisation move that had had caused great hardship to the common man. Other subjects discussed included the stalemate between the government and the judiciary that had resulted in many vacancies not being filled as well as the grave situation that farmers across the country were facing. 
If the meeting saw archrivals TMC and the CPI(M) coming together on a common platform, there was some heartburn among the Opposition leaders gathered there that TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had independently sought time with President Pranab Mukherjee. “We should have all gone together,” said a senior opposition leader at the meeting. 
Meanwhile, on Monday, Ms. Banerjee, now apparently to forget her rivalry with the Left, tweeted her opposition after Prime Minister Narendra Modi justified the demonetisation move in Ghazipur. “The PM said the poor are sleeping peacefully. This is an insult to commoners and in bad taste. My humble suggestion is not to hit the common people like this.”
The Congress, also continued its daily briefing on the demonetisation issue, as the party’s communication chief Randeep Surjewala said, “India’s ‘wheel of development’ has come to a standstill as crores of people are lining up in front of banks and ATMs giving up their daily livelihood... An autocratic Prime Minister, bloated by the arrogance of numbers, has plunged the country into a state of ‘economic anarchy’, wiping out people’s earnings and creating a colossal sense of fear and insecurity.. People standing in lines outside are neither thieves nor black money hoarders. .

2016-11-15 20:31:00,"Demonetisation unscientific, says YSRC ","TIRUPATI: YSR Congress activists, led by party’s State general secretary Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, staged a demonstration at Gandhi Circle here on Tuesday in protest against the “unscientific” demonetisation exercise taken up by the Central government.
Laying a siege to the main road leading to the RTC bus station, the party activists raised slogans against the Centre for “throwing life out of gear and causing serious dent to the nation’s economy.” 
Mr. Reddy said that the Centre should be held responsible for the loss of livelihood of the poor, loss of lives in hospitals for want of money, and imminent fall in the GDP due to the exercise. 
“Tens of thousands of man hours are wasted as people are made to stand in queues to exchange, deposit, and withdraw currency notes. The government should have thought of a hassle-free system before introducing the rule,” he said. 
While stating that party was not against the motto behind the exercise, Mr. Karunakar Reddy said they were against the “haphazard” manner in which it was taken up. 
He rebuked “Modi supporters” of muzzling criticism in the garb of nationalism and terming detractors as “anti-national.”
He was later taken into custody by the Tirupati East police.
Congress stages dharna
Congress workers, led by former MP Chinta Mohan, too staged a dharna at Potti Sriramulu Circle near SVRR Government General Hospital. 
He took exception to the way the Central government was “playing” with the lives of the poor and middle class, while ignoring the super rich, who had actually hoarded unaccounted for money.
Referring to the people running from pillar to post for exchanging their old currency notes, Dr. Mohan wondered if it was the “Acche Din” promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
“People across the country are suffering, but the Centre is blind to this fact. This government does not want to see the truth,” he charged.

2016-11-15 01:18:00,Are demonetised notes striking gold?,"Financial investigation agencies have gathered prima facie evidence suggesting that a number of jewellers and foreign exchange operators in the country indulged in illicit conversion of demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. 
The Customs Intelligence has zeroed in over 400 big jewellers in 25 cities on reports that soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation, they showed a sharp jump in sales. In the black market, the gold price had gone up to Rs. 50,000 for 10 grams. 
In one case, a jeweller sold 201 kg of gold in just three days, leaving a minuscule balance in its coffers. His accounts are being scrutinised. 
“We will share the findings with our sister agencies for necessary action. The Income Tax Department is keeping track of the transactions in question and has served notice,” said a senior Customs official. An estimated 2.5 million jewellers and half-a-million goldsmiths operate across the country.
The agencies suspect that several jewellery houses would show receipts in part payments below Rs.2 lakh per buyer to ensure that they do not have to produce their PAN numbers to the authorities. 
The jewellers usually deposit cash in banks every week after producing transaction records. 
If the investigators come across transactions revealing a trend on deliberate splitting of sales, an explanation will be sought from such jewellers. 
Following an Enforcement Directorate crackdown on over 70 unscrupulous foreign exchange operators, an official said, such practices have stopped in Delhi. “Irregularities have been found in the transactions of several forex operators in some cities, which are being investigated further,” said the official. 
The Income Tax Department is also conducting discreet inquiries on several real estate operators in different States, including Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. 
It is suspected that attempts are being made to push the unaccounted-for cash into the system by entering into land deals at highly inflated rates. 
Reports of some mid-rung companies trying to adjust cash in their account books have also been received. 
Besides, the department is gearing up to investigate the dormant accounts in which huge sums have reportedly been deposited after the dem onetisation announcement. Bank authorities have been told to collate and share the record of such transactions with the Finance Ministry.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Are-demonetised-notes-striking-gold/article16405150.ece,NEW DELHI 
2016-11-15 19:25:00,Demonetisation eats into Nanjangud temple’s revenue," There has been a drastic decline in the revenue of the Srikanteshwara Temple at Nanjangud post the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency last week. According to Jayaprakash, executive officer of the temple, the income of the temple has reduced by over 35 per cent on an average after the demonetisation move of the Union government. The demonetisation process has also had an impact on the number of devotees visiting the temple. There has been a 40 per cent decline in the number of devotees visiting the temple, Mr. Jayaprakash said.
 Mr. Jayaprakash told The Hindu that the average income of the temple is about Rs. 1.25 crore per month, that includes the sale of special entrance tickets, archana tickets and other religious rituals performed at the temple. But after the ban of higher denomination notes, there has been a sharp decline in the income and as well as number of visitors to the temple, he added. 
“Devotees are producing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes for different sevas. The temple authorities have no other option but to refuse the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The temple authorities are asking the devotees to give small denomination notes as religious institutions are not permitted to accept the banned notes,” Mr. Jayaprakash said. As a result, people who can afford to buy tickets for special entrance or special pooja stand in long queues for the darshan and this has resulted in the temple losing a major chunk of its income, Mr. Jayaprakash said. 
 Over 3,500 to 4,000 people normally visit the temple on Sundays, Mondays and other auspicious days and at least 2,000 people visit the temple on other days on an average, he said. “Even dakshine to the arathi thatte has come down drastically,” he said. 
He said that the temple authorities were not aware of people putting bags of the now banned Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes into the temple hundis. However, he said that he will soon appeal to the Deputy Commissioner of the district to open the hundis in the last week of November to check if the banned notes had been put into them.
Similarly, there has been a sharp decline in the income and the number of visitors to the Chamundeshwari Temple here. ",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Demonetisation-eats-into-Nanjangud-temple%E2%80%99s-revenue/article16430065.ece,Mysuru
2016-11-15 18:18:00,Demonetisation: SUCI activists protest in Mysuru ,"The Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI) has questioned the demonetisation exercise of the Union Government to curb black money and described it as a futile endeavour. SUCI activists, who staged a demonstration here on Tuesday, said none of the big fishes with black money have been affected by demonetisation. The commoners and the honest tax-paying citizens are among the worst hit and are bearing the brunt of the Union government’s move, they said. They said similar demonetisation initiatives were taken up in 1946 and 1978 but they were not successful in curbing black money and SUCI averred that a similar outcome may be expected out of the current exercise as well. Individuals with unaccounted for money would have invested them on land, gold and other avenues and rarely hold on to cash and hence the move was affecting the poor and the middle class, they said. “Which political or business big wig is standing in a queue in front of banks and ATMs to withdraw their quota of Rs. 2,000 per day?” questioned SUCI activists. Daily wagers, both in rural and urban areas, are under stress owing to non-payment of wages in the absence of adequate currency notes. “The situation is grave in rural areas where banking network and penetration is low,” they added.

2016-11-15 01:18:00,Modi terms demonetisation ‘kadak chai’," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that the poor supported his decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and questioned the moral authority of his political opponents, especially the Congress, to criticise his step as ‘anti-poor’ and ‘anti-common man’. 
Addressing a parivartan rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur, Mr. Modi recalled the Emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and charged that the measure was taken only to “save Ms. Gandhi’s seat.” In contrast, Mr. Modi claimed, his move was taken in the “interest of the poor and farmers,” and for the good of the country.
A day after his emotional speech in Goa, the Prime Minister reiterated his appeal to the people to give him 50 days to complete the “big task,” a “mahayagna of honesty,” of unearthing black money. Mr. Modi referred to his own background as a tea-seller. “My decision is kadak (strong) When I was a child, the poor would ask me to make kadak chai. The poor are fond of it. I have a habit since childhood of making kadak chai. It suits the poor but warps the expression of the rich,” he said.

2016-11-15 00:00:00,‘Demonetisation has reduced cash flow to cooperative societies’,"Kishan Hegde Kolkebail, president, Udupi District Cooperatives Union, said on Monday that the Union government’s move to demonetise currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit the cooperative sector hard.
He was speaking at the 63rd All India Cooperative Week celebrations organised by the State Federation of Cooperatives, District Cooperatives Union and Udupi Taluk Industrial Cooperative Society, here.
Mr. Kolkebail said that the demonetisation had reduced the cash flow to cooperative societies. These societies could only remit cash to the commercial banks. Though customers were ready to repay their loans, accepting it had become a problem.
Cooperative societies were not official agents for exchanging currency. Only banks registered with the Reserve Bank of India could exchange currency. The cooperatives sector had urged the government to give some relaxation to it, Mr. Kolkebail said.
In his inaugural speech, K. Raviraj Hegde, president, Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Producers Union, said that there were 225 cooperative societies in Udupi district. The working capital of these societies put together was estimated at Rs. 5,000 crore.
They were producing more services to the people than the commercial banks in rural areas.
About the Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Producers Union, he said that nearly 4 lakh litres of milk was being collected daily from the dairy farmers in the district.
The farmers were getting close to Rs. 35 per litre including incentive.
Due to the collection of milk from dairy farmers and their sale in urban centres, nearly Rs. 14 crore was moving from urban areas to rural areas in the region. This showed how cooperative sector was helping the people in the rural areas. It was easier for people to get loans from the cooperative societies than commercial banks, Mr. Hegde, said.
Kokkarne Surendranath Shetty, associate professor, MGM College, delivered a lecture on importance of cooperative societies. Arun Kumar Shetty, president of Udupi Taluk Industrial Cooperative Society; Meenakshi Bannanje, president, Udupi City Municipal Council; Amrita Krishnamurthy, municipal councillor; Praveen B.

2016-11-15 00:00:00,Demonetisation takes the fizz out of property sales,"The impact of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes is being felt in the real estate sector, which recorded around 40 per cent slump in transaction in Mysuru.
The worst hit is the sale and resale of plots, which entails high volume of cash, unlike the sale of built or ready-to-occupy apartments that are loan-based. A dip in transactions was seen when the demonetisation move was announced on Tuesday night, said senior sub-registrar of Mysuru South M. Vivek.
He told The Hindu that the slump in the Mysuru south office was about 15 per cent but it was as high as 40 per cent in three other sub-registrar offices in the city. “Against the average 40 site registrations per day in the Mysuru South office, the figures have come down by 15 per cent and there is a dip in high-value transactions,” he added. However, there was a property registration of Rs. 8.9 crore during this period, Mr. Vivek said.
Between Wednesday and Friday, the revenue earned was around Rs.1.3 crore in the Mysuru south office. However, stakeholders, including builders, aver that the slump in real estate transaction was higher. A prominent real estate agent, also into writing deeds, said transactions and registration of sites are down by 50 per cent and only properties with bank loans are being registered. “The scenario will prevail till March 2017 and real estate value will crash further to benefit commoners,” he said.
The real estate market in Mysuru was already stagnating and hence, unless there is a distress sale, sellers are expected to hold on to their property to create an artificial scarcity in the long run, according to him.
However, the Builders Association of India, Mysuru centre, averred that purchase of flats and apartments by the salaried class has not been affected as funding is through loan. Demonetisation will mostly impact sale of sites, BAI said.
But, there is a perception that sale of high-end luxury apartments and properties will be affected.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Demonetisation-takes-the-fizz-out-of-property-sales/article16448212.ece,MYSURU

(pic by S. Ramesh Kurup in Nica)
KOZHIKODE: It was nearly 3 o’clock in the morning when T. Sethumadhavan Nair, assistant general manager, State Bank of Travancore, Kozhikode, left his office on November 10.
Most of his colleagues too had stayed back: it was the first day since the banks opened for the public after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s important speech on live television withdrawing the currency notes of Rs. 500 and 1000.
On the previous day, the banks had not opened for the public, but the employees had worked hard, preparing for the after-effects of demonetisation, the magnitude of which was unprecedented in the country. 
Yet, they were not prepared for the frenzy and the panic the public displayed on November 10. “In my career of 36 years in banking, I have never seen anything like this,” said Sethumadhavan. “We had opened additional counters, but even that was not enough. Besides serving our own customers, my bank also has to supply the currency to 27 other banks in the city; so the load is enormous on our employees.”
They have not taken a day off since November 9. “We do not even get time to have our lunch properly,” said N.L. Premalatha, who works at the Palayam branch of SBT. “But we have no complaints; we understand the difficulties of the common man.”
A. Raghavan, a chief associate at the administrative office of the State Bank of India, Kozhikode, said many of the employees had even cancelled their leaves because of the crisis. “And we had to redeploy of our resources to ensure that the customers got their cash from the counters,” he said. “We stopped doing the back-office work, such as writing reports and opening new accounts, so that everyone could be assigned at the front office.”
Besides handing out the cash, the employees also have had to assure the people that their money was safe in the bank. “At our branch, we have a lot of customers who are migrant labourers, from States like Bengal,” said Raghavan. “Most of them make remittances to their relatives back home. And some of them told us that they were exploited by the natives, who would give them currency notes worth 400 in exchange of the Rs. 500 note.”
Sethumadhavan said he was expecting another busy week for bank employees like him. “But, we are willing to work like this,” he said.

Many pilgrims who talked to The Hindu here on Tuesday when the Ayyappa temple was opened for the two-month Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season shared more or less the same thought. 
But, all of them said they had to struggle a lot to mobilise lower-denomination currency notes before embarking on their pilgrimage to Sabarimala. 
“Keeping more bundles of notes was another inconvenience we faced,’’ said another Guruswami from Karnataka. 
However, the traders at Pampa have reportedly started feeling the heat of the demonetisation. R. Ramachandran Nair, a hoteleer at Pampa, told The Hindu that shortage of lower-denomination currency was a major problem merchants of Sabarimala faced.

Prakash Babu has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had demolished the Constitutional authority of the RBI by announcing the demonetisation of the country’s Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes.
“Mr. Modi had completely sidelined the practical solutions put forth by the RBI in connection with any such move”. Mr Prakash Babu said.
He was inaugurating a dharna by the district unit of the CPI in front of the Kollam main branch of the State Bank of India on Tuesday to register the party’s protest against the alleged indifference of the Centre towards the difficulties faced by the people as a result of the demonetisation.
“Such a move has the aim of reaping political capital from the coming Assembly elections to five States as one of its goals. Black money and counterfeit money are two different entities,” Mr. Prakash Babu said.
 He said that demonetisation appears to have the hidden agenda of wiping out the primary cooperative banks to suit the interests of the corporate houses.
Instead of acting Mr. Modi is trying to run away from the situation he created by telling the people everything would turn normal in 50 days.

2016-11-15 20:22:00,Demonetisation leaves rural economy paralysed ," Last weekend, several instances of panam payattu (also called kurikkalyanam) in Kozhikode, Malappuram and other north Kerala districts were cancelled. The reason — the scrapping of Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes.
Panam Payattu is a traditional way of raising funds in the rural areas of these districts for building a house, marrying off a daughter or meeting a financial emergency. At the panam payattu  event, held at a pre-scheduled venue and time (usually on weekends) by the needy person, people chip in for the cause with contributions of Rs.500 or its multiples.
Many of last weekend’s payattu events had to be cancelled because people had no money to give. This is one of the myriad examples of how the demonetisation of high value currency notes is fast paralysing the rural economy.
“I haven’t gone fishing for the past three days,” says Chekhov of Chelannur in Kozhikode. “People don’t have cash with them to pay for my fish.” The 66-year-old Chekhov and his colleagues make a living by fishing in the Pavayil Puzha, a tributary of Korappuzha River. The scooter-borne fish vendors, who buy fish regularly from Chekhov, have not shown up ever since the high value notes were demonetised.
While 1000s and 500s are invalidated, 100s and 50s are hard to come by. Lottery vendors and thattukada operators are among the worst-hit. An elderly lottery vendor at Atholi said he had hardly sold any tickets for the past five days. 
P. Uthaman of Kakkodi, a retired sub-registrar officer who is now a registered document writer, said a large network of people who made a living from the real estate sector were now in trouble. Registration of land, houses and flats had come down to a fourth as the stamp duty and the registration fee needed to be paid in hard currency. Only small transactions and registration of wills and leases were taking place. He said people in the rural areas who had hoped to get their land sold for meeting financial emergencies were tense.
Artisans and semi-skilled workers, electricians and plumbers are all without an income now as people have postponed repairs to their houses. Cobblers, motorbike repairmen, mobile phone shop-owners, autorickshaw drivers and mini-lorry owners are underemployed. In the high-land areas of Kozhikode and Kannur districts, where small rubber plantations are aplenty, many rubber dealers’ shops remain shuttered as they don’t have the money to pay rubber producers.

“It (the exercise) may not succeed in what it seeks to achieve. Instead it seems to have created negative impact. The BJP government should respond to the allegation that the announcement was made with a view to getting votes in Assembly elections in a few States,” he said in a statement.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice R. Mahadevan made the observations while dismissing a miscellaneous petition moved by A.A. Sadik Ali, President of Forum for Election Integrity, seeking to postpone the elections to the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur Assembly constituencies scheduled on November 19 to December 31 in view of demonetisation of high value currencies.
Mr. Sadik Ali alleged that the candidates of the AIADMK and the DMK contesting from the two constituencies had access to robust finance, and hence, there were chances of distribution of money to voters in the denomination of Rs. 500 and 1,000 to the tune of Rs. 50 crores.
“Since an individual voter can exchange currencies worth Rs. 4,000 per day, the black money which would be distributed to them can be easily accounted for,” the petitioner claimed.
Alleging that the election would pave way for large-scale conversion of black money, the petitioner said that unless the election is postponed till December 31, which is the last day to exchange the demonetised currencies, the conversion of such unaccounted money cannot be stopped.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-HC-dismisses-plea-to-postpone-election/article16405367.ece,CHENNAI

The State tourism industry is reporting huge losses: while private tourist taxi operators estimate a 50 per cent drop in business, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and Karnataka State Hotels and Restaurants Association claim that business has dipped by 25 to 30 per cent over the last few days.
Rajender Kumar Kataria, managing director, KSRTC, said direct bookings had dropped by 25 per cent. However, online ticket reservations have seen a drop of about 10 per cent. “During weekdays we get revenue of Rs. 7.25 crore, while weekends fetch us over Rs. 8 crore,” he said, and added that weekend business was down by Rs. 1 crore.
During November and December, nearly 95 per cent of the KSRTC’s 8,400-odd fleet strength hits the road because of an increase in the number of tourists from and to Bengaluru. However, in the last few days, they have been operating fewer buses. “Usually during weekends over 25,000 tickets are booked from and to Bengaluru from places such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. This weekend, it dropped to 20,000,” Mr. Kataria said.
Meanwhile, R.K. Holla, president, Bangalore Tourist Taxi Operators’ Association, said that people were not able to withdraw money from ATMs because of which there had been a drastic drop in the number of tourists visiting hills stations and pilgrimage spots in Karnataka and the neighbouring States.
Mr. Holla explained that owing to the lack of cash, even drivers were reluctant to go on long trips. “All of them do not have bank accounts because of which they have have not been able to draw money to give change. Since the process of getting inter-State permit has not gone online still, they are not able to pay cash and get them. Besides, the drivers usually have food at roadside eateries that do not accept card payment. All these factors put together has impacted our business,” he said.
Checks on those making bulk bookings
KSRTC managing director Rajender Kumar Kataria has instructed his staff to run checks on organisations making bulk bookings before accepting the order. Often, private and political parties book over 50 buses for functions. However, over the last 48 hours, KSRTC has received three such bulk bookings from organisations, and officials suspect that it’s a money laundering gimmick.
Such bulk bookings usually cost over Rs 1 crore. “For this, customers have to provide a deposit amount running to lakhs of rupees. This can be ‘black’ money and when they cancel it in a few days, we will have to return it,” said a KSRTC official.
To prevent this, the managing director has asked his staff to consult the head office before cancelling bulk bookings.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-Tourism-sector-takes-a-hit/article16448010.ece,BENGALURU
2016-11-15 22:18:00,Officials asked to study impact of demonetisation ," Chief Secretary Rajiv Sharma has directed the authorities of various State government departments to study the impact of demonetisation of higher denomination currency note on revenue collection in different sectors.
At a review meeting conducted here on Tuesday, the Chief Secretary wanted senior officials -- Special Chief Secretaries K. Pradeep Chandra, S.P. Singh, M.G. Gopal, Ranjeev R. Acharya, Ajay Misra and S.K. Joshi, Principal Secretaries S. Narsing Rao, K. Ramakrishna Rao and Sunil Sharma, Inspector General of Police (Intelligence) Navin Chand and others to review the situation every day.
Mr. Rajiv Sharma suggested them to hold meetings with the officials concerned to keep a tab on the impact of demonetisation by speaking to individual officers and organisations engaged in the exercise of revenue collection. 
He asked them to study and report on the long-term impact of the Centre’s decision on State revenue, particularly on the revenue collected during the first seven months of the financial years and the remaining five months in the backdrop of demonetisation.
Further, the Chief Secretary reviewed the prospects of devolution of State’s share in taxes collected by the Centre, grants and flow of other funds so that a strategy could be prepared to tackle the situation. He discussed month-wise revenue collection from registrations, value added tax (VAT), excise, transport (motor vehicles) tax, non-tax revenue and monthly expenditure of the State government.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Officials-asked-to-study-impact-of-demonetisation/article16434677.ece,HYDERABAD
2016-11-15 00:10:00,Cong workers take to street protesting demonetisation,"HYDERABAD: Thousands of Congress workers took to streets across Telangana on Monday protesting what it termed ‘unplanned move’ of demonetising high value currency by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Responding to the call given by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N.Uttam Kumar Reddy, party cadres held demonstrations throughout the State taking out rallies and burning the Prime Minister in effigy. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy himself led the protest in Hyderabad by first offering floral tributes to former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and then taking out a march in Abids. He and other Congress leaders were taken into custody by the police and shifted to Gandhinagar police station. 
Congress leaders continued their protest inside the police station and raised “Modi Hatao — Desh Bacho” (Remove Modi To Save The Country). Speaking to reporters, the TPCC chief accused the Prime Minister of enforcing ‘Financial Emergency’ in the country by implementing an unplanned decision. He said that the demonetisation of high-value notes has brought misery to common people, especially poor, middle-class, housewives and farmers. He said crores of people across India were suffering since November 8 midnight and Modi’s decision has pushed the country into a chaotic situation. 
“Congress is not against removal of black money. But the way they are implementing it shows lack of foresight and planning,” he said. adding that the Congress was only protesting against the problems being faced by the people.
Senior leaders including former minister Danam Nagendra, ex-MP M. Anjan Kumar Yadav, ex-MLA Sudhir Reddy, TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayan Reddy and others were present.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Cong-workers-take-to-street-protesting-demonetisation/article16402673.ece,
2016-11-15 00:00:00,When demonetisation did not whip up a storm,"“Nobody had that kind of money [high denomination notes of Rs.10,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs.1,000] when demonetisation happened in 1978. It did not affect us directly. The working class carried on without any problem. The kind of money that was taken off circulation was something that only families of industrialists had at that point. Currency notes of Rs.1,000 were a rarity in the hands of the common man. Back then, salaries and savings didn’t amount to the currency that was demonetised,” said 80-year-old Lakhbir Singh, an ex-government employee, talking about the 1978 demonetisation move.
Mr. Singh said that daily life — buying daily provisions, travel, paying rent, school fee, etc. — had carried on seamlessly.
“It would not be wrong to say that normal life carried on smoothly. There was no problem for the general public as a whole,” he added. He did say that this time, though the move was welcome, it had hit the common man the hardest.

‘Common man hit hard’

“I see people waiting in long lines outside banks and post offices, and these don’t seem to be getting shorter. The transition has hit the common man and his daily life has been disturbed. My son, who works in the public relations field, was asked to take advance payments in cash [old currency notes], which put him in a fix. I would say that comparing the two phases wouldn’t be fair. We hope, however, that the long-term benefits reach the common man,’’ he added.
Seventy-nine-year-old Promilla Tuli, who ran a garments factory back in 1978, recalled that demonetisation then had not affected her business. “I remember hearing that the government had abolished high-value notes, but it didn’t matter to us. We never had those notes; we didn’t feel the need for it,” she said.
In fact, many old-timers say that most people were not affected the last time the government experimented with demonetisation as the amount of high-value notes in circulation was quite less. The average citizen did not feel the pinch as these notes accounted for about 10 per cent of the money in circulation. This time, however, the government has withdrawn Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, which account for over 85 per cent of the money, causing all sections of society being hit hard.

Usually by this time, I would have done business of about Rs. 8,000 or Rs. 10,000.

2016-11-15 02:51:00,Demonetisation and after,"The long, anxious, and frustrating wait by people outside banks and ATMs across the country over the last five days is an inevitable consequence of the decision to demonetise notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000. When 86 per cent of the value of notes in circulation turns suddenly invalid, as it did with Prime Minister Modi’s ‘surgical strike’ last week, a certain degree of disruption and pain is unavoidable. But the question is whether this chaos could have been anticipated and managed better than it has been. Replacement of the demonetised notes is a time-consuming exercise that requires planning of the highest order. The experience of the last few days shows that preparation was lacking and the transition could have been handled much better. ATMs are running out of cash quickly while banks are dispensing more of the Rs.2,000 notes than those of lower denominations. What use is a high-value note if there is not enough smaller currency to make an exchange? Of course, it was never an easy task for the Reserve Bank of India and the Centre to strike the right balance between secrecy and storing adequate quantity of notes for quick distribution. All the same, there are at least a couple of issues that could have been addressed differently.
The new Rs.500 notes that hit the market on Monday could have been released immediately after the announcement last week. Putting out new Rs.500 notes along the Rs.2,000 notes would have placed much less strain on those of the Rs.100 denomination, which are anyway in short supply. Second, it appears that officials woke up a little late to the issue of recalibrating ATMs. At least a day, if not more, was lost as banks realised the ATMs would not be able to dispense the new notes. The communication with the public, who were in a state of panic, could have been better, too. Thankfully, the Centre has woken up to ease the pressure on the system by increasing withdrawal limits, allowing for petroleum outlets and hospitals to accept the old series of notes until November 24 and pushing more cash through post offices. The worst-affected are people in rural areas and villages where cash is king and the banking system’s penetration is poor. The decision to relax cash-holding limits for banking correspondents, the crucial link between banks and villages, to Rs.50,000 and allowing them to replenish multiple times a day should help in faster distribution.

While the broader indices fell by about two per cent, the fall in NBFC shares was much sharper. Mortgage financier Can Fin Homes stock slumped 20 per cent while Manappuram Finance stock declined 16.6 per cent from their previous close.
Some of the other NBFCs like Capital First (-13.6%) Edelweiss Financial (-9.5%), LIC Housing Finance (-7.7%), also felt the impact.
A substantial number of NBFC customers are from semi-urban and rural areas, and the borrowers are transport operators, farmers, equipment hirers, small and medium enterprises and small traders, among others who mostly deal in cash.
“The current round of demonetisation is likely to disrupt the small business ecosystem in the near term, as the segment operates largely in cash,” Kotak Securities said in a report. “We see challenging times for real estate, small businesses and CV finance.”
Last week, the Centre banned Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denomination bank notes in a move to curb black money and said such notes can be exchanged at bank branches and post officer before December 30.
The process of exchange and withdrawal of legal tenders have been slow with automated teller machines requiring re-calibration.
NBFCs have also requested the Centre to allow them to accept such notes till December 30.
“The borrowers’ business has been affected with no money circulation,” Finance Industry Development Council – the industry body for asset finance NBFCs said in a statement. “Because of the very nature of their trade and credit behaviour, if we don’t collect the available cash from the borrowers, it is most likely to roll forward to the next month, making it more difficult for them to repay.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice R. Mahadevan made the observations while dismissing a miscellaneous petition moved by A.A. Sadik Ali, President of Forum for Election Integrity, seeking to postpone the elections to the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur Assembly constituencies scheduled on November 19 to December 31 in view of demonetisation of high value currencies.
Mr. Sadik Ali alleged that the candidates of the AIADMK and the DMK contesting from the two constituencies had access to robust finance, and hence, there were chances of distribution of money to voters in the denomination of Rs. 500 and 1,000 to the tune of Rs. 50 crores.
“Since an individual voter can exchange currencies worth Rs. 4,000 per day, the black money which would be distributed to them can be easily accounted for,” the petitioner claimed.
Alleging that the election would pave way for large-scale conversion of black money, the petitioner said that unless the election is postponed till December 31, which is the last day to exchange the demonetised currencies, the conversion of such unaccounted money cannot be stopped.",Chennai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Demonetisation-Madras-High-Court-dismisses-plea-to-postpone-election/article16448307.ece,CHENNAI

Little did he know that a decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the night of November 8, would jeopardise his week-long fun that he planned with his family. 
The demonetisation scheme has hit the tourists hard. 
Talking to The Hindu, he said, “I was carrying all Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. And they turned into waste paper, as neither the hotels nor the taxi drivers or the restaurants for that matter, refused to take the currency, as they were no longer legal tender.” 
With great difficulty, he could get in touch with a common friend who helped him out with some change and exchange a few notes of Rs. 500.
“My tour, which was planned for a lavish outing, has turned into rationed living,” he lamented.
This has been the case with most of the tourists, who feel that they are stranded despite the government giving a clear instruction that tourists are exempted.
The tourists are facing problem for minor things such as paying auto charges or buying gift articles from roadside stalls, as every tourist does, or for paying food bills at small eateries. 
“We have not encountered any problems in big malls, as there are card swiping machines. But not everybody can afford to do shopping at malls. And most importantly, this city is new to us and we are unable to exchange our notes at the ATM counters, as they are either not working or there is a big queue,” said Arup Sen, another tourist from Burdwan district in West Bengal.
According to Sunit Kumar Panja of Nimantran Hotel, the tourist flow has suddenly died down. 
“Being a hotelier, we are in touch with most of the lodges and we understand that there are over 30 per cent cancellations. This is the beginning of the tourist season and if the trend continues then the business for this season is hit badly,” he said.
Besides tourism, the flow from the city has also slowed down. 
According to the Welfare Group of Tours and Travels, there are about 10 per cent cancellation of outbound travel and those who are planning have indefinitely postponed their travel plans. 
“People do not want to take the risk, till things settle down,” said an executive of the tour company.
Last year, the city of destiny recorded about 1.15 crores of tourist footfalls, which included about 69,000 foreign tourists. 
The tourism season is at its peak from October to January, which stood at about 40 lakhs of the 1.15 crores, which accounts for about 35 per cent in four months.",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Tourists-bear-the-brunt-of-demonetisation/article16417430.ece,VISAKHAPATNAM

Lakhs of farmers, who are already reeling from drought and crop failure, have reportedly missed the deadline to avail themselves of the scheme, which ended on November 9. The worst hit are the horticultural farmers. Though the deadline was extended to November 10, most of them missed the deadline to pay the premium as they were unable to withdraw cash from banks. On November 12, the State government held an urgent meeting with registered insurance companies to help farmers avail themselves of the scheme.
A senior government official said, “The scheme applies to Kharif, Rabi and horticultural farmers. While the former two have mostly enrolled themselves within the October 31 deadline, horticultural farmers have missed it. Most of them had old currency notes and could not exchange them in banks owing to long queues.”
The failure to include all farmers in the scheme could have far-reaching impacts. The scheme might not achieve its ambitious target of increasing crop area from the existing 23 per cent to 50 per cent of the gross cropped area in three years. Eight five lakh farmers are part of the scheme. Since 2000, the State government has been giving out crop insurance. Officials said over the past five years, an average of Rs. 900 crore has been doled out every year. The deadline of scheme was extended from August 2 owing to delay in shortlisting the insurance company. The Opposition has criticised the government for the delay and not ridding the scheme of its inherent flaws.
Shankar Dhondge, former MLA and national president of the Nationalist Congress Party’s Rashtravadi Shetkari Sabha, said, “There is a basic flaw in the crop insurance: it doesn’t compensate farmers in accordance to the area destroyed. Meanwhile, there is chaos at the banks and the government has not given priority to farmers.” Mr. Dhondge alleged that there was a scam in the registration of insurance companies and the data list of the beneficiaries was being tampered with.
Truck drivers beyond traders' means, porters paid a pittance
The limited availability of cash following the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has crippled the transportation of goods to and from agricultural produce market committees (APMC). 
While truck drivers transport produce from the farm to the market, porters help the traders move the goods from the trucks. Sanjay Pansare, a fruit trader, said, “To rent a truck hailing from Kashmir one has to pay Rs. 80,000 to 1 lakh every day. The truck drivers don’t accept payment only in cash. We are not able to afford transportation costs.”
Nanasaheb Patil, former chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, “How far can you stretch the credit game? It might be a bit easy in urban areas, but it has turned disastrous in rural areas. You have to pay in cash and there is absolutely no alternative.”
Rajan Kshirsagar, an activist of the agricultural labour union from Parbhani, said porters at the APMCs are also affected. “They either have no work or are paid an awfully less amount of money.”
According to government sources, market committees in Mumbai are the least affected. An official said, “We do not see major problem at present. Else, there would have been a price hike in vegetables and other commodities. We hope the situation will get better.” - Staff Reporter",Mumbai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Demonetisation-hits-PM%E2%80%99s-flagship-crop-insurance-scheme/article16417010.ece,Mumbai
2016-11-15 00:00:00,Tourists bear the brunt of demonetisation,"Rajkumar Chatterjee, a tourist from Kolkata, reached Visakhapatnam on November 9, for a week’s stay in the port city. Little did he know that a decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the night of November 8, would jeopardise his week-long fun that he planned with his family.
The demonetisation scheme has hit the tourists hard.
Talking to The Hindu , he said, “I was carrying all Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. And they turned into waste paper, as neither the hotels nor the taxi drivers or the restaurants for that matter, refused to take the currency, as they were no longer legal tender.”
With great difficulty, he could get in touch with a common friend who helped him out with some change and exchange a few notes of Rs. 500.
“My tour, which was planned for a lavish outing, has turned into rationed living,” he lamented.
This has been the case with most of the tourists, who feel that they are stranded despite the government giving a clear instruction that tourists are exempted.
The tourists are facing problem for minor things such as paying auto charges or buying gift articles from roadside stalls, as every tourist does, or for paying food bills at small eateries.
“We have not encountered any problems in big malls, as there are card swiping machines. But not everybody can afford to do shopping at malls. And most importantly, this city is new to us and we are unable to exchange our notes at the ATM counters, as they are either not working or there is a big queue,” said Arup Sen, another tourist from Burdwan district in West Bengal.
According to Sunit Kumar Panja of Nimantran Hotel, the tourist flow has suddenly died down.
“Being a hotelier, we are in touch with most of the lodges and we understand that there are over 30 per cent cancellations. This is the beginning of the tourist season and if the trend continues then the business for this season is hit badly,” he said.
Besides tourism, the flow from the city has also slowed down.
According to the Welfare Group of Tours and Travels, there are about 10 per cent cancellation of outbound travel and those who are planning have indefinitely postponed their travel plans.
“People do not want to take the risk, till things settle down,” said an executive of the tour company.
Last year, the city of destiny recorded about 1.15 crores of tourist footfalls, which included about 69,000 foreign tourists.
The tourism season is at its peak from October to January, which stood at about 40 lakhs of the 1.15 crores, which accounts for about 35 per cent in four months.",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Tourists-bear-the-brunt-of-demonetisation/article16448408.ece,VISAKHAPATNAM
2016-11-16 19:53:00,"Demonetisation: Opposition alleges information leak, seeks JPC probe"," 
The winter session of Rajya Sabha opened on Wednesday with a united opposition mounting an assault on the government over demonetisation, saying it had led to “economic anarchy” in the country and alleged selective leak of the information before the announcement which should be probed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee.
The government rejected as baseless the Opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the November 8, 2016 decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems.
Joining ranks over the raging issue, parties such as the Congress, the JD(U), the RJD, the SP, the BSP, the Trinamool Congress, the Left parties and the AIADMK slammed the government, particularly targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for making Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes invalid and said the “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” step had severely hit the common people, the farmers and the poor.
During a discussion on demonetisation, which was taken up after suspension of all business in response to notices given by a host of Opposition members, a scathing attack was made on the government which strongly defended the step as one taken in national interest and to end corruption and black money, which it linked to terror activities in the country.
Alleging that the information had been leaked to BJP units and “friends of BJP”, a number of Opposition parties demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into it.
During the course of seven-hour debate which remained inconclusive, there were repeated demands by the Opposition members that the Prime Minister should be present in the House to listen to the members. The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said Mr. Modi, who did not come to the House on Wednesday, should at least be present on Thursday and possibly intervene.
Initiating the debate, Congress leader Anand Sharma used wit and humour to attack Modi, saying he was “insensitive” to problems caused to the common man.
The “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” move has unleashed “economic anarchy” in the country and benefited a few, he said.
“Your government is insensitive,” he said, adding Mr. Modi was riding a bullet train in Japan when the old, women and common man were queueing up at banks at 3 a.m. to get currency to buy their daily needs.
Questioning the government’s contention that the step was taken to end the menace of black money, the former Union Minister said a Rs. 2000 note has been brought which is similar to the paper on which churan is sold and “sheds colour”.
Mr. Sharma alleged that the information on demonetisation was selectively leaked. “Your BJP units have deposited crores of rupees (just before the November 8 decision),” he said.
He quoted some media reports to support his allegation, saying State Bank of India — the country’s largest lender — knew of the decision way back in March and a Gujarati newspaper had in April 2016 published a report of move to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes.
He asked the Prime Minister to state where he got Rs.23,000-24,000 crore, estimated by the International Money Watch Group, for his Lok Sabha elections. He also asked if cheque or credit card payments were made to organise his rally in Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh a few days ago.
He demanded a probe into “how many people bought more than Rs 1 crore of foreign currency and bullion” since April. “This is a serious issue... you never kept secrecy (about the decision),” Mr. Sharma said.
Mr. Sharma said Mr. Modi had in his Goa speech had stated that those standing in line at banks were those involved in 2G spectrum and coal scam as well as holding black money.
“I condemn the Prime Minister for calling the poor standing in queue for his Rs 4,000-4,500, black money holders and scamsters,” he said.
Referring to Mr. Modi’s statement in Goa last week that certain forces were out to eliminate him, the Congress leader asked him to name the conspirators wanting to eliminate the Prime Minister of India. The Congress will not tolerate anyone planning to harm the Prime Minister of the country, he said.
Taking a dig at Mr. Modi, he said someone who “changes clothes five times a day”, has become Prime Minister and travels around the globe was “calling himself a sanyasi and tapasvi”.
Mr. Sharma demanded that the names of persons holding accounts in Swiss banks and those revealed in the Leichtenstein and HSBC lists should be made public. The names of bank loan defaulters above Rs. 5000 crore should also be made public.
While the decision had put the common man to immense hardship by way of having to stand in long queues to lay hands on valid currency to meet daily needs, the information about demonetisation was selectively leaked to the “friends of BJP,” Mr. Sharma alleged.
The move had branded 86 per cent of the currency in circulation black money and “everyone a criminal,” he said adding when Mr. Modi announced the plan it was expected that adequate arrangements would be made for dispensing new notes.
So banks and ATMs were shut on November 9, 2016, but the expectation of normalcy from next day were dashed with queues only getting longer by the day.
The government policy was to “benefit those who are your friends and hurt those who question you,” he said adding an atmosphere has been created in the country where questions cannot be asked and those doing so branded anti-nationals.
“The magnanimous Prime Minister allowed Rs. 4,000 of old currency to be changed... what right does the Constitution give the government to place restrictions on withdrawal of ones hard-earned money,” he asked, adding one has to “beg to be allowed to withdraw his own money”.
He said former RBI Governor I.G. Patel had written about the government’s decision to demonetise currency in 1978 and it would be absurd to think that all ill-gotten money is kept in cash and not invested in real estate, bullion, equities or foreign exchange.
Mr. Modi, Mr. Sharma said, had reasoned that withdrawal of the higher denomination currency to fight against black money, terrorist funding and counterfeit currency. the Congress is unequivocally opposed to black money and opposes any force that print counterfeit currency.
Mr. Sharma said the government in one stroke took away 86.4 per cent of the over Rs. 16 lakh crore currency in circulation. .
“Did the government think that 86 per cent of the currency in circulation was counterfeit or black money,” he asked.
Stating that cash to GDP ratio of Indian economy was 12-14 per cent, he said farmers, daily wagers and workers do not carry credit cards, cheque books or card swipe machines in their “dhotis or tahmeds”.
Moving towards cashless economy was fine but even the most developed economies of U.S. or Europe have not achieved that objective yet. If they had, the U.S. central bank would have stopped printing dollars, European Central Bank won’t be printing Euros and the U.K. central bank would have stopped printing pound sterling, he said.
Stating that the government had in one stroke declared everyone a criminal, he said the government and the Finance Minister have stated that terrorists would have benefited if advance information on the decision was given. “Which terrorist goes to RBI with sack full of counterfeit currency to change.”
After withdrawing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, restrictions were placed even on foreign tourists who could not get their currency changed.
The Congress leader said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament in August 2016 that fake currency was 0.02 per cent of the total currency in circulation. “If 0.02 per cent by government admission is counterfeit currency, how can that be made the base to remove 86 per cent of currency in circulation,” he said.
An undeclared emergency has put common people in grave inconvenience, he said while crime money, ill-gotten wealth and that accrued through corruption or tax evasion is black money, Prime Minister should answer if he considered money in the market, or in households, or with farmers, workers and employees was also black money.
“This question arises because a message has gone that Indian economy was run on black money... you decide but don’t brand the whole country,” he said, adding whether the cash the farmers gets for his crop or the one he uses to buy seeds or fertilizer was black money. He said the move had rendered millions of agriculture workers and labourers unemployed.
Across the country, ATM machines are not working even after more than a week of the demonetisation decision and queues at banks are only increasing, Mr. Sharma said, adding the BJP government has not lived up to its poll promise of creating 5 crore jobs as employment is on the rise.
BSP leader Mayawati said the House should request the Prime Minister to be present and answer the members’ concerns.
It is “a very serious issue”, she said, adding she has been observing Mr. Jaitley appears “sad”.
Her demand was supported by Mr. Azad, who said the Prime Minister must be present in the House to hear out the concerns of various parties.
Earlier, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said he had received as many as 13 notices under rule 267 for suspension of business to take up discussion on inconvinience and hardships caused by demonetisation of currency.
He said there was a general consensus for discussion and the government too was agreeable, so the list of business as notified stands completely suspended.
Mr. Azad demanded that Mr. Modi should at least “hear out the feelings of six-seven main parties, otherwise there is a mismatch. The feelings of Opposition members should be heard by PM. I demand that at least he hears them out and sit in the House at least today. We can wait for him to come.”
This was objected to by D.P. Tripathi (NCP), who said that as the Leader of the Opposition he should not distinguish between the big and small parties.
Ram Gopal Yadav joined Mr. Sharma to allege that information on demonetisation was “leaked” and termed it as a scam while demanding a thorough probe into it.
“A BJP leader in Punjab had tweeted on November 5 about the new Rs. 2000 note. How did this happen? This is an issue of concern. There is a scam in this. This should definitely be probed,” he said, alleging further that 10 per cent of the people have 90 per cent of wealth of the country and the remaining 90 per cent do not have anything.
The common people, especially the poor and the housewives were put to great hardship through this move and if elections are held today they will teach this government a lesson, he said, adding that majority of women who saved money through household savings were upset with the move.
“Elections are not fought with money power. You cannot win elections through money power. No one can win elections like that. Elections are won only by winning the hearts of people,” he said.
Demonetisation of high denomination currency has created big problems to common people and and law and order situation is being created with police being deployed outside banks to control the queue.
“Do not hold elections now. If you meet and ask for votes from housewives in villages, they will beat you up with belan and you will have to embalm your back with turmeric,” he said, adding that you might lose elections if you hold early polls.
Mr. Yadav said the entire House was against corrupt and drug money, but lamented that an impression is being created that those opposing this are against curbing black money which is erroneous.
Mr. Yadav also sought a probe into the “suspicion” of leak of the demonetisation decision and said a JPC can be constituted. He said the move by the government has led to lot of hardships in the villages and the villagers have stopped buying normal things like toothpaste and hair oil.
“If this continues, no one would buy Baba Ramdev products also and his factories will shut down,” he said, suggesting that the government should restart the scheme for people to declare their black money.
He said that the government has fixed the Basic Selling Price was Rs. 1,500 per quintal but because of the demonetisation, the price has come down to just Rs. 1,000 and demanded that farmers should be allowed to use the old notes to buy seeds and fertilisers.
Taking note of Prime Minister’s remarks that he might be killed because of his move, Mr. Yadav said there should be probe to find out who these people are and precaution should be taken. He said it should also be probed if the statement was made only for political motive.
He also mentioned that off late, many messages are being spread on social media targeting the PM in “filthiest of words” and the cyber cell should find out where it is originating from.
AIADMK leader A. Navaneethakrishnan said the RBI and the government have failed the rural people with this move which has threatened the saving habit of people.
JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who also sought a JPC probe into the suspected leak, said the sudden move was akin to “jumping out of a moving train”.
He said unlike the rich, who the PM said were standing in queue, it was the poor, handicapped and old people who were doing so to get their hands on their hard earned money.
He alleged that while loans worth Rs. 7,000 crore was written off on Wednesday by banks including Rs. 1,200 crore of Vijay Mallya, the Prime Minister had made the honest of the country to stand in queues.
Mr. Yadav also took a dig at Mr. Jaitley saying he was sure that the Finance Minister was not part of the decision making on demonetisation, because had he been, Mr. Jaitley would have tipped him off. This remark left most members including Mr. Jaitley laughing.
CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said that of the 130 crore population in the country, only 2.6 crore have credit cards.
He took a dig at Mr. Modi and narrated the infamous quote of Queen Marie Antoinette during the French revolution who had said that people can eat cakes when they don’t have bread. “We have Modi Antoinette who says ‘If you don’t have paper, use plastic’”.
Launching a frontal attack on the Prime Minister, Mr. Yechury compared him with a Roman ruler. He said a Senator had remarked about this ruler that: “I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they’ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they’ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it’s the sand of the Coliseum. He’ll bring them death — and they will love him for it.”
Alleging that a BJP unit in Kolkata deposited Rs. 1 crore in Indian’s Bank Account on November 8, 2016 he said “prove me if I am wrong.” He added that Prime Minister was advertising for Paytm while talking about cashless economy. “It is no longer Jai Hind. PM is appearing for advertisements Jio Hind.”
He questioned how the cashless transactions could take place when 86 per cent of the transactions in the country took place via cash.
The CPI(M) leader said 1/5th of the economy is black economy and people who kept black money invested it in real estate, gold etc. That is why the imports surged and stated that it was this PM only who had stated that 95 per cent of the black money is stashed offshore and is in safe havens. “PM is cleaning a pond to kill crocodiles but big crocodiles have survived and only small fish are dying.”
He alleged that SBI has waived off Rs. 7,000 crore of NPAs, to which Mr. Jaitely said that written off does not means loan waiver. Mr. Yechury while mentioning Mr. Mallya said in effect the money given to the defaulter was not going to be realised.
Mr. Yechury said by demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, the problem of black money was not going to be solved and this way the government was killing the poor.
He also demanded that corporate funding of all political parties should stop and there should be a system of state funding for elections to which Mr. Kurien said, “Why don’t you move a private member’s bill in this regard?”
On Mr. Yechury’s charge that the government had brought it FCRA for foreign funding, Mr. Jaitley said there is only a small amendment to benefit Indian companies giving funds in Indian accounts.
Mr. Yechury also questioned how cooperative banks were not entrusted with powers to change currency notes whereas bulks of the Indians were dealing with rural cooperative banks.
Terming the demonetisation move as Tughlak shahi, he said the length of queues before banks and ATMs was ever increasing and asked why the government was agonising the people.
He sought an investigation into the move, saying “let there be a joint parliamentary committee” for a proper probe. .
“We need to know the motive behind the move” as before every parliamentary session there is some gimmick which diverts attention from other major issues.
Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who spoke on behalf of the ruling side, rejected as baseless the opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems.
“There is no politics in it. It is a step taken in national interest,” he said, adding it will help the country in the long run.
“If anyone has the strength to take on black money and corruption, it is the BJP government and Narendra Modi,” the minister said.
He claimed that common people are out in support of the government’s move which is aimed against graft and terror and that the step will lead to curbing inflation and tax rate may come down.
Mr. Goyal claimed that the country has welcomed this initiative of the Modi government and it is natural that some people who have black money and are indulging in corruption and black money are worried about it.
“There is no curb on honestly-earned money. So nobody should have a problem,” he added.
“Desh me imandaar ka samman hua hai aur beimaan ka nuksaan hua hai (The honest have been honoured and the dishonest have faced losses),” he said.
“I am confident that public is understanding the initial problems because the decision was kept a secret. No honest taxpayer will lose a single rupee. The loss will be of those who have amassed wealth through corruption and black money and the public should also support the government in the move,” he said.
Mr. Goyal said some pain and difficulty in the implementation of such a decision is inevitable but despite that the people have strongly supported the move.
He urged all the parties to support the move so that the House gives a message to the country that all are against corruption and black money.
To Mr. Sharma’s charge that those questioning the government are labelled as anti-national, he said, “Understandably if someone opposes it (demonetisation), questions will be raised on whether they are against ending the menace of corruption and black money in the country.”
Taking a dig at the opposition, he said, “We thought all political parties will support us in Parliament. But for some reasons they have opposed the move. It seems they are worried due to the large public favouring it and supporting the government despite the problems being faced by them.”
Mr. Goyal also said the BJP has already put out its poll expenses on the website and after this step all will think before indulging in corruption and black marketing.
Responding to issues raised by the Opposition, he said some people have been saying that seven or 10 days’ time should have been given. “Secrecy is most important for such a step,” he added.
Listing the benefits of the move, Mr. Goyal said interest rates will come down, inflation would be curbed and even the tax rate will come down.
“If 5 people don’t pay tax, the brunt is borne by the rest of 95 percent people. And if taxes are paid, there will be more money with the Centre to carry out welfare works for farmers, women, SC and ST sections,” he added.
With regard to allegations that the move has been timed to benefit the BJP in the U.P. elections, he said such a statement itself implies that people support this step.
To demands that the government should declare the names of people who have Swiss Bank accounts, Mr. Goyal said such a step will make it difficult for government to obtain more information about such accounts.
But some people want the government to make the error of declaring these names and then it will have difficulty in getting this information, he claimed.
Launching a scathing attack on the government, Ms. Mayawati compared demonetisation with an “economic emergency” thrust on the nation.
The move, she said, would rebound against the BJP in the 2019 general elections and the party would face defeat in the assembly elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Assam.
“Masses are in pain. The Prime Minister must be sleeping after taking pills. The move is without preparedness and people will punish BJP in 2019 during general elections.
“People of five States going for elections including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab will punish BJP,” she said, adding that the poor and the middle classes were the worst sufferers.
“It is an immature decision taken in haste and the whole country feels that is an ‘economic emergency’,” she said adding that it was like a “Bharatbandi situation.”
“Many died not from shock but from problems. We are not opposed to flushing out black money from the system but the decision to ban notes has been taken in haste without proper preparation,” she said, adding that private hospitals were closing their doors to patients while the farmers have no money to buy seeds.
She said ATMs did not function during the initial two days when the Prime Minister made big claims in Japan and alleged that the BJP had resorted to corruption and people were brought to Mr. Modi’s recent rally in Ghazipur by paying money.
“Ten months time for preparing the move was devoted to settling notes with some BJP leaders and industrialists,” the BSP chief said and sought to know why Prime Minister has sought 50 days time when he took 10 months for his secret preparations for the move.
At the same time, she said if the PM really wanted to curb black money, he should take action against his party leader from Karnataka who was also part of a mining mafia.
She also questioned the timing of the move saying all of a sudden why this move was implemented when elections were due in five States.
Pramod Tiwari (Congress) compared the Prime Minister to mythological demon Bhasmasur, who had the power to burn and turn into ashes anyone whose head he touched with his hand.
“This move by government will impact rabi crops, wheat and potatoes, and have left farmers in distress,” he added.
Mr. Tiwari said Mr. Modi had compared the currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 to scrap, which is wrong as the promissory note mentions that the government ‘promises’ to pay the owner that much amount.
To this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said Mr. Modi had only said that these denomination notes will be scrap for the corrupt people.
Mr. Tiwari compared Modi to Muammar Qadhafi, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, which drew sharp criticism from the BJP benches with Mr. Naqvi and Ravi Shankar Prasad asking the Chair to expunge the remarks. But Mr. Tiwari stood his ground.
Mr. Tiwari claimed that the government has taken this step to help its industrialist friends.
He demanded that a JPC should be formed to probe the issue.
Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the exercise to take out Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes is . “temporary pain for long-term gain“.
“Prime Minister wants a behavioural change in the country... This is a war on corruption and black money and you (Opposition) have to decide which side you are on,” he added.
Listing the efforts made by the NDA government to weed out corruption and black money, the Union Urban Development Minister said that in its first cabinet meeting the government has cleared the proposal to set up a special investigative team on black money.
“We fought the elections in 2014 on corruption and scams. People expected us to take a clear cut stand,” he said.
Attacking the Opposition, the Minister said he expected an enlightened debate in the House.
Stating that government is following all the developments in the issue, he informed that the Prime Minister is holding review meeting everyday and the Finance Minister is closely monitoring the situation.
Mr. Naidu said that according to information on the Internet, the parallel economy in India is 22.2 per cent of country’s total economy, while it is 8 per cent for the U.S.
After Mr. Naidu’s speech, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said that the discussion is not over and will continue on Thursday from 2 p.m.
To this, some members said the debate is very important and it should start from 11 a.m. by suspending Zero Hour and the Question Hour.
Mr. Azad said the discussion is under Rule 267, which means all business has to suspended.
Mr. Kurien replied that the rule was applicable for Wednesday and if it has to be put for Thursday’s discussion, then a motion has to be moved tomorrow at the appropriate time.
Mr. Azad also demanded that the Prime Minister should also be present in the House during the discussion.
Mr. Kurien adjourned the House for the day saying discussion will be done at 2 p.m. unless members move a motion.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Opposition-alleges-information-leak-seeks-JPC-probe/article16458796.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-16 19:51:00,Legal questions on demonetisation find no answer in SC ," The legal provision under which the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) demonetisation notification of November 8 was issued only empowers the Central Government to scrap “series” of bank notes and not the “entire existing currency” of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. 
Section 26 (2) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act of 1934 — the provision under which the notification was issued — allows the Centre to make a declaration only to the extent that “any series of bank notes of any denomination ceases to be legal tender.”
The argument was pressed before a Bench of Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud on Wednesday, and remains to be addressed by the apex court.
“We are on the constitutional validity of the November 8 notification. Under what diktat have all series of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes become black money? Does this mean any note of Rs. 500 is black money?” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for petitioner Adil Alvi, had submitted.
Secondly, the Supreme Court was informed of how the government has insisted on identity cards for people coming to exchange the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes for the new currency. Section 26 (2) of the 1934 Act poses no such requirements. Even the latest development to use indelible ink mark to avoid repeat exchanges is a restriction not found in the legal provision.
The court was also asked to adjudicate on the authority of the notification to restrict a citizen’s right to withdraw money from his own bank account.
“Payment by the bank is a guaranteed act under the law. Banks are only trustees of a person’s money. I can withdraw any amount of money. Under what law can you restrict my right to withdrawal?” Mr. Sibal had asked.
Another legal question placed before the court was on what basis the notification categorised Rs. 500 currency as “high denomination” in this time of inflation when the particular denomination of bank notes forms 86 per cent of value of currency.
“We have to see at some point of time what they took into account for reaching this conclusion,” Mr. Sibal submitted.
Section 26A of the 1934 Act records the first demonetisation which took place in 1956 when the government of that time scrapped all Rs. 500, Rs. 1000 and Rs. 10,000 bank notes minted before January 13, 1946. In 1978, demonetisation happened again, but the bank notes frozen then formed only two per cent of the currency value in circulation.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Legal-questions-on-demonetisation-find-no-answer-in-SC/article16458786.ece,NEW DELHI

“We are on the constitutional validity of the November 8 notification. Under what diktat have all series of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes become black money? Does this mean any note of Rs. 500 is black money?” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for petitioner Adil Alvi, had submitted.
Secondly, the Supreme Court was informed of how the government has insisted on identity cards for people coming to exchange the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes for the new currency. Section 26 (2) of the 1934 Act poses no such requirements. Even the latest development to use indelible ink mark to avoid repeat exchanges is a restriction not found in the legal provision.
The court was also asked to adjudicate on the authority of the notification to restrict a citizen’s right to withdraw money from his own bank account.
“Payment by the bank is a guaranteed act under the law. Banks are only trustees of a person’s money. I can withdraw any amount of money. Under what law can you restrict my right to withdrawal?” Mr. Sibal had asked.
Another legal question placed before the court was on what basis the notification categorised Rs. 500 currency as “high denomination” in this time of inflation when the particular denomination of bank notes forms 86 per cent of value of currency.
“We have to see at some point of time what they took into account for reaching this conclusion,” Mr. Sibal submitted.
Section 26A of the 1934 Act records the first demonetisation which took place in 1956 when the government of that time scrapped all Rs. 500, Rs. 1000 and Rs. 10,000 bank notes minted before January 13, 1946. In 1978, demonetisation happened again, but the bank notes frozen then formed only two per cent of the currency value in circulation.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Legal-questions-on-demonetisation-find-no-answer-in-SC/article16644466.ece,NEW DELHI
2016-11-16 19:50:00,"Demonetisation: Opposition alleges information leak, seeks JPC probe","The winter session of Rajya Sabha opened on Wednesday with a united opposition mounting an assault on the government over demonetisation, saying it had led to “economic anarchy” in the country and alleged selective leak of the information before the announcement which should be probed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee.
The government rejected as baseless the Opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the November 8, 2016 decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems.
Joining ranks over the raging issue, parties such as the Congress, the JD(U), the RJD, the SP, the BSP, the Trinamool Congress, the Left parties and the AIADMK slammed the government, particularly targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for making Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes invalid and said the “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” step had severely hit the common people, the farmers and the poor.
During a discussion on demonetisation, which was taken up after suspension of all business in response to notices given by a host of Opposition members, a scathing attack was made on the government which strongly defended the step as one taken in national interest and to end corruption and black money, which it linked to terror activities in the country.
Alleging that the information had been leaked to BJP units and “friends of BJP”, a number of Opposition parties demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into it.
During the course of seven-hour debate which remained inconclusive, there were repeated demands by the Opposition members that the Prime Minister should be present in the House to listen to the members. The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said Mr. Modi, who did not come to the House on Wednesday, should at least be present on Thursday and possibly intervene.
Initiating the debate, Congress leader Anand Sharma used wit and humour to attack Modi, saying he was “insensitive” to problems caused to the common man.
The “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” move has unleashed “economic anarchy” in the country and benefited a few, he said.
“Your government is insensitive,” he said, adding Mr. Modi was riding a bullet train in Japan when the old, women and common man were queueing up at banks at 3 a.m. to get currency to buy their daily needs.
Questioning the government’s contention that the step was taken to end the menace of black money, the former Union Minister said a Rs. 2000 note has been brought which is similar to the paper on which churan is sold and “sheds colour”.
Mr. Sharma alleged that the information on demonetisation was selectively leaked. “Your BJP units have deposited crores of rupees (just before the November 8 decision),” he said.
He quoted some media reports to support his allegation, saying State Bank of India — the country’s largest lender — knew of the decision way back in March and a Gujarati newspaper had in April 2016 published a report of move to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes.
He asked the Prime Minister to state where he got Rs.23,000-24,000 crore, estimated by the International Money Watch Group, for his Lok Sabha elections. He also asked if cheque or credit card payments were made to organise his rally in Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh a few days ago.

You never kept secrecy: Anand Sharma

 He demanded a probe into “how many people bought more than Rs 1 crore of foreign currency and bullion” since April. “This is a serious issue... you never kept secrecy (about the decision),” Mr. Sharma said.
Mr. Sharma said Mr. Modi had in his Goa speech had stated that those standing in line at banks were those involved in 2G spectrum and coal scam as well as holding black money.
“I condemn the Prime Minister for calling the poor standing in queue for his Rs 4,000-4,500, black money holders and scamsters,” he said.
Referring to Mr. Modi’s statement in Goa last week that certain forces were out to eliminate him, the Congress leader asked him to name the conspirators wanting to eliminate the Prime Minister of India. The Congress will not tolerate anyone planning to harm the Prime Minister of the country, he said.
Taking a dig at Mr. Modi, he said someone who “changes clothes five times a day”, has become Prime Minister and travels around the globe was “calling himself a sanyasi and tapasvi”.
Mr. Sharma demanded that the names of persons holding accounts in Swiss banks and those revealed in the Leichtenstein and HSBC lists should be made public. The names of bank loan defaulters above Rs. 5000 crore should also be made public.
While the decision had put the common man to immense hardship by way of having to stand in long queues to lay hands on valid currency to meet daily needs, the information about demonetisation was selectively leaked to the “friends of BJP,” Mr. Sharma alleged.
The move had branded 86 per cent of the currency in circulation black money and “everyone a criminal,” he said adding when Mr. Modi announced the plan it was expected that adequate arrangements would be made for dispensing new notes.
So banks and ATMs were shut on November 9, 2016, but the expectation of normalcy from next day were dashed with queues only getting longer by the day.
The government policy was to “benefit those who are your friends and hurt those who question you,” he said adding an atmosphere has been created in the country where questions cannot be asked and those doing so branded anti-nationals.
“The magnanimous Prime Minister allowed Rs. 4,000 of old currency to be changed... what right does the Constitution give the government to place restrictions on withdrawal of ones hard-earned money,” he asked, adding one has to “beg to be allowed to withdraw his own money”.
He said former RBI Governor I.G. Patel had written about the government’s decision to demonetise currency in 1978 and it would be absurd to think that all ill-gotten money is kept in cash and not invested in real estate, bullion, equities or foreign exchange.
Mr. Modi, Mr. Sharma said, had reasoned that withdrawal of the higher denomination currency to fight against black money, terrorist funding and counterfeit currency. the Congress is unequivocally opposed to black money and opposes any force that print counterfeit currency.
Mr. Sharma said the government in one stroke took away 86.4 per cent of the over Rs. 16 lakh crore currency in circulation. .
“Did the government think that 86 per cent of the currency in circulation was counterfeit or black money,” he asked.
Stating that cash to GDP ratio of Indian economy was 12-14 per cent, he said farmers, daily wagers and workers do not carry credit cards, cheque books or card swipe machines in their “
dhotis or tahmeds”.
Moving towards cashless economy was fine but even the most developed economies of U.S. or Europe have not achieved that objective yet. If they had, the U.S. central bank would have stopped printing dollars, European Central Bank won’t be printing Euros and the U.K. central bank would have stopped printing pound sterling, he said.
Stating that the government had in one stroke declared everyone a criminal, he said the government and the Finance Minister have stated that terrorists would have benefited if advance information on the decision was given. “Which terrorist goes to RBI with sack full of counterfeit currency to change.”
After withdrawing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, restrictions were placed even on foreign tourists who could not get their currency changed.
The Congress leader said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament in August 2016 that fake currency was 0.02 per cent of the total currency in circulation. “If 0.02 per cent by government admission is counterfeit currency, how can that be made the base to remove 86 per cent of currency in circulation,” he said.

‘An undeclared emergency’

 An undeclared emergency has put common people in grave inconvenience, he said while crime money, ill-gotten wealth and that accrued through corruption or tax evasion is black money, Prime Minister should answer if he considered money in the market, or in households, or with farmers, workers and employees was also black money.
“This question arises because a message has gone that Indian economy was run on black money... you decide but don’t brand the whole country,” he said, adding whether the cash the farmers gets for his crop or the one he uses to buy seeds or fertilizer was black money. He said the move had rendered millions of agriculture workers and labourers unemployed.
Across the country, ATM machines are not working even after more than a week of the demonetisation decision and queues at banks are only increasing, Mr. Sharma said, adding the BJP government has not lived up to its poll promise of creating 5 crore jobs as employment is on the rise.

‘PM should be present’

 BSP leader Mayawati said the House should request the Prime Minister to be present and answer the members’ concerns.
It is “a very serious issue”, she said, adding she has been observing Mr. Jaitley appears “sad”.
Her demand was supported by Mr. Azad, who said the Prime Minister must be present in the House to hear out the concerns of various parties.
Earlier, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said he had received as many as 13 notices under rule 267 for suspension of business to take up discussion on inconvinience and hardships caused by demonetisation of currency.
He said there was a general consensus for discussion and the government too was agreeable, so the list of business as notified stands completely suspended.
Mr. Azad demanded that Mr. Modi should at least “hear out the feelings of six-seven main parties, otherwise there is a mismatch. The feelings of Opposition members should be heard by PM. I demand that at least he hears them out and sit in the House at least today. We can wait for him to come.”
This was objected to by D.P. Tripathi (NCP), who said that as the Leader of the Opposition he should not distinguish between the big and small parties.
Ram Gopal Yadav joined Mr. Sharma to allege that information on demonetisation was “leaked” and termed it as a scam while demanding a thorough probe into it.
“A BJP leader in Punjab had tweeted on November 5 about the new Rs. 2000 note. How did this happen? This is an issue of concern. There is a scam in this. This should definitely be probed,” he said, alleging further that 10 per cent of the people have 90 per cent of wealth of the country and the remaining 90 per cent do not have anything.
The common people, especially the poor and the housewives were put to great hardship through this move and if elections are held today they will teach this government a lesson, he said, adding that majority of women who saved money through household savings were upset with the move.
“Elections are not fought with money power. You cannot win elections through money power. No one can win elections like that. Elections are won only by winning the hearts of people,” he said.
Demonetisation of high denomination currency has created big problems to common people and and law and order situation is being created with police being deployed outside banks to control the queue.
“Do not hold elections now. If you meet and ask for votes from housewives in villages, they will beat you up with belan and you will have to embalm your back with turmeric,” he said, adding that you might lose elections if you hold early polls.
Mr. Yadav said the entire House was against corrupt and drug money, but lamented that an impression is being created that those opposing this are against curbing black money which is erroneous.
Mr. Yadav also sought a probe into the “suspicion” of leak of the demonetisation decision and said a JPC can be constituted. He said the move by the government has led to lot of hardships in the villages and the villagers have stopped buying normal things like toothpaste and hair oil.
“If this continues, no one would buy Baba Ramdev products also and his factories will shut down,” he said, suggesting that the government should restart the scheme for people to declare their black money.
He said that the government has fixed the Basic Selling Price was Rs. 1,500 per quintal but because of the demonetisation, the price has come down to just Rs. 1,000 and demanded that farmers should be allowed to use the old notes to buy seeds and fertilisers.
Taking note of Prime Minister’s remarks that he might be killed because of his move, Mr. Yadav said there should be probe to find out who these people are and precaution should be taken. He said it should also be probed if the statement was made only for political motive.
He also mentioned that off late, many messages are being spread on social media targeting the PM in “filthiest of words” and the cyber cell should find out where it is originating from.
AIADMK leader A. Navaneethakrishnan said the RBI and the government have failed the rural people with this move which has threatened the saving habit of people.

Move akin to jumping out of a moving train: Sharad Yadav

 JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who also sought a JPC probe into the suspected leak, said the sudden move was akin to “jumping out of a moving train”.
He said unlike the rich, who the PM said were standing in queue, it was the poor, handicapped and old people who were doing so to get their hands on their hard earned money.
He alleged that while loans worth Rs. 7,000 crore was written off on Wednesday by banks including Rs. 1,200 crore of Vijay Mallya, the Prime Minister had made the honest of the country to stand in queues.
Mr. Yadav also took a dig at Mr. Jaitley saying he was sure that the Finance Minister was not part of the decision making on demonetisation, because had he been, Mr. Jaitley would have tipped him off. This remark left most members including Mr. Jaitley laughing.

‘Modi Antoinette says if you don’t have paper, use plastic’

 CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said that of the 130 crore population in the country, only 2.6 crore have credit cards.
He took a dig at Mr. Modi and narrated the infamous quote of Queen Marie Antoinette during the French revolution who had said that people can eat cakes when they don’t have bread. “We have Modi Antoinette who says ‘If you don’t have paper, use plastic’”.
Launching a frontal attack on the Prime Minister, Mr. Yechury compared him with a Roman ruler. He said a Senator had remarked about this ruler that: “I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they’ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they’ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it’s the sand of the Coliseum. He’ll bring them death — and they will love him for it.”
Alleging that a BJP unit in Kolkata deposited Rs. 1 crore in Indian’s Bank Account on November 8, 2016 he said “prove me if I am wrong.” He added that Prime Minister was advertising for Paytm while talking about cashless economy. “It is no longer Jai Hind. PM is appearing for advertisements Jio Hind.”
He questioned how the cashless transactions could take place when 86 per cent of the transactions in the country took place via cash.
The CPI(M) leader said 1/5th of the economy is black economy and people who kept black money invested it in real estate, gold etc. That is why the imports surged and stated that it was this PM only who had stated that 95 per cent of the black money is stashed offshore and is in safe havens. “PM is cleaning a pond to kill crocodiles but big crocodiles have survived and only small fish are dying.”
He alleged that SBI has waived off Rs. 7,000 crore of NPAs, to which Mr. Jaitely said that written off does not means loan waiver. Mr. Yechury while mentioning Mr. Mallya said in effect the money given to the defaulter was not going to be realised.
Mr. Yechury said by demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, the problem of black money was not going to be solved and this way the government was killing the poor.
He also demanded that corporate funding of all political parties should stop and there should be a system of state funding for elections to which Mr. Kurien said, “Why don’t you move a private member’s bill in this regard?”
On Mr. Yechury’s charge that the government had brought it FCRA for foreign funding, Mr. Jaitley said there is only a small amendment to benefit Indian companies giving funds in Indian accounts.
Mr. Yechury also questioned how cooperative banks were not entrusted with powers to change currency notes whereas bulks of the Indians were dealing with rural cooperative banks.
Terming the demonetisation move as Tughlak shahi, he said the length of queues before banks and ATMs was ever increasing and asked why the government was agonising the people.
He sought an investigation into the move, saying “let there be a joint parliamentary committee” for a proper probe. .
“We need to know the motive behind the move” as before every parliamentary session there is some gimmick which diverts attention from other major issues.

Govt. fields Piyush Goyal

 Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who spoke on behalf of the ruling side, rejected as baseless the opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems.
“There is no politics in it. It is a step taken in national interest,” he said, adding it will help the country in the long run.
“If anyone has the strength to take on black money and corruption, it is the BJP government and Narendra Modi,” the minister said.
He claimed that common people are out in support of the government’s move which is aimed against graft and terror and that the step will lead to curbing inflation and tax rate may come down.
Mr. Goyal claimed that the country has welcomed this initiative of the Modi government and it is natural that some people who have black money and are indulging in corruption and black money are worried about it.
“There is no curb on honestly-earned money. So nobody should have a problem,” he added.
“
Desh me imandaar ka samman hua hai aur beimaan ka nuksaan hua hai (The honest have been honoured and the dishonest have faced losses),” he said.
“I am confident that public is understanding the initial problems because the decision was kept a secret. No honest taxpayer will lose a single rupee. The loss will be of those who have amassed wealth through corruption and black money and the public should also support the government in the move,” he said.
Mr. Goyal said some pain and difficulty in the implementation of such a decision is inevitable but despite that the people have strongly supported the move.
He urged all the parties to support the move so that the House gives a message to the country that all are against corruption and black money.
To Mr. Sharma’s charge that those questioning the government are labelled as anti-national, he said, “Understandably if someone opposes it (demonetisation), questions will be raised on whether they are against ending the menace of corruption and black money in the country.”
Taking a dig at the opposition, he said, “We thought all political parties will support us in Parliament. But for some reasons they have opposed the move. It seems they are worried due to the large public favouring it and supporting the government despite the problems being faced by them.”
Mr. Goyal also said the BJP has already put out its poll expenses on the website and after this step all will think before indulging in corruption and black marketing.
Responding to issues raised by the Opposition, he said some people have been saying that seven or 10 days’ time should have been given. “Secrecy is most important for such a step,” he added.
Listing the benefits of the move, Mr. Goyal said interest rates will come down, inflation would be curbed and even the tax rate will come down.
“If 5 people don’t pay tax, the brunt is borne by the rest of 95 percent people. And if taxes are paid, there will be more money with the Centre to carry out welfare works for farmers, women, SC and ST sections,” he added.
With regard to allegations that the move has been timed to benefit the BJP in the U.P. elections, he said such a statement itself implies that people support this step.
To demands that the government should declare the names of people who have Swiss Bank accounts, Mr. Goyal said such a step will make it difficult for government to obtain more information about such accounts.
But some people want the government to make the error of declaring these names and then it will have difficulty in getting this information, he claimed.

Move will hit BJP in U.P., says Mayawati

 Launching a scathing attack on the government, Ms. Mayawati compared demonetisation with an “economic emergency” thrust on the nation.
The move, she said, would rebound against the BJP in the 2019 general elections and the party would face defeat in the assembly elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Assam.
“Masses are in pain. The Prime Minister must be sleeping after taking pills. The move is without preparedness and people will punish BJP in 2019 during general elections.
“People of five States going for elections including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab will punish BJP,” she said, adding that the poor and the middle classes were the worst sufferers.
“It is an immature decision taken in haste and the whole country feels that is an ‘economic emergency’,” she said adding that it was like a “Bharatbandi situation.”
“Many died not from shock but from problems. We are not opposed to flushing out black money from the system but the decision to ban notes has been taken in haste without proper preparation,” she said, adding that private hospitals were closing their doors to patients while the farmers have no money to buy seeds.
She said ATMs did not function during the initial two days when the Prime Minister made big claims in Japan and alleged that the BJP had resorted to corruption and people were brought to Mr. Modi’s recent rally in Ghazipur by paying money.
“Ten months time for preparing the move was devoted to settling notes with some BJP leaders and industrialists,” the BSP chief said and sought to know why Prime Minister has sought 50 days time when he took 10 months for his secret preparations for the move.
At the same time, she said if the PM really wanted to curb black money, he should take action against his party leader from Karnataka who was also part of a mining mafia.
She also questioned the timing of the move saying all of a sudden why this move was implemented when elections were due in five States.

Pramod Tiwari likens Modi to Bhasmasur, Mussolini, Hitler, Qadhafi

Pramod Tiwari (Congress) compared the Prime Minister to the mythological demon Bhasmasur, who had the power to burn and turn into ashes anyone whose head he touched with his hand.
“This move by government will impact rabi crops, wheat and potatoes, and have left farmers in distress,” he added.
Mr. Tiwari said Mr. Modi had compared the currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 to scrap, which is wrong as the promissory note mentions that the government ‘promises’ to pay the owner that much amount.
To this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said Mr. Modi had only said that these denomination notes will be scrap for the corrupt people.
Mr. Tiwari compared Modi to Muammar Qadhafi, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, which drew sharp criticism from the BJP benches with Mr. Naqvi and Ravi Shankar Prasad asking the Chair to expunge the remarks. But Mr. Tiwari stood his ground.
Mr. Tiwari claimed that the government has taken this step to help its industrialist friends.
He demanded that a JPC should be formed to probe the issue.

Temporary pain for long-term gain: Venkaiah

Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the exercise to take out Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes is . “temporary pain for long-term gain“.
“Prime Minister wants a behavioural change in the country... This is a war on corruption and black money and you (Opposition) have to decide which side you are on,” he added.
Listing the efforts made by the NDA government to weed out corruption and black money, the Union Urban Development Minister said that in its first cabinet meeting the government has cleared the proposal to set up a special investigative team on black money.
“We fought the elections in 2014 on corruption and scams. People expected us to take a clear cut stand,” he said.
Attacking the Opposition, the Minister said he expected an enlightened debate in the House.
Stating that government is following all the developments in the issue, he informed that the Prime Minister is holding review meeting everyday and the Finance Minister is closely monitoring the situation.
Mr. Naidu said that according to information on the internet, the parallel economy in India is 22.2 per cent of country’s total economy, while it is 8 per cent for the U.S.
After Mr. Naidu’s speech, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said that the discussion is not over and will continue on Thursday from 2 p.m.
To this, some members said the debate is very important and it should start from 11 a.m. by suspending Zero Hour and the Question Hour.
Mr. Azad said the discussion is under Rule 267, which means all business has to suspended.
Mr. Kurien replied that the rule was applicable for Wednesday and if it has to be put for Thursday’s discussion, then a motion has to be moved tomorrow at the appropriate time.
Mr. Azad also demanded that the Prime Minister should also be present in the House during the discussion.
Mr. Kurien adjourned the House for the day saying discussion will be done at 2 p.m. unless members move a motion.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Opposition-alleges-information-leak-seeks-JPC-probe/article16644623.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-16 17:21:00,"Demonetisation is in national interest, govt defends in Rajya Sabha"," Facing opposition onslaught, the government on Wednesday put up a strong defence in Rajya Sabha on demonetisation, saying the step was taken in national interest to end corruption and black money, which it is said is also used for terror activities in the country.
Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who spoke on behalf of the ruling side after Congress leader Anand Sharma slammed the government, rejected as baseless the Opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems.

Mr. Goyal said when the NDA government assumed charge in 2014, the country was embroiled in corruption and scams. Now the Modi government has taken a step, through which he has met the “expectations” of the people, the Minister added.
“There are some people who are unhappy over it. This is an important step in the war against graft, terror and drugs and political parties should be happy over it,” he said.
Justifying the move, Mr. Goyal also claimed that from the documents and reports available, the RBI had realised that a large quantum of money was not circulating or coming to the chests and analysed that this money was hidden.
“Now the government cannot give a specific figure for this. But the RBI gave a proposal to the government and it came before the Cabinet, which approved the move,” Mr. Goyal said.

2016-11-16 01:13:00,CPI(M) attacks Centre on demonetisation,"A day before the winter session of Parliament begins, the CPI(M) attacked the Modi government and the BJP on demonetisation, “authoritarian tendencies” at the Centre and in BJP-ruled States and “communal polarisation.”
“The withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes has led to total disruption of the payments and settlements system and has impacted all citizens in one way or the other,” a party release said on Tuesday.
“In rural areas, the crisis is grave. Markets are closed in various places. People are unable to buy even bare essentials, life-saving medicines etc.”
The statement echoed party general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s view that the measure does not address black money, corruption, counterfeit currency notes and terror funding.
“Cash constitutes only six per cent of the black economy,” the release said. “... Also, the basic avenues for money laundering through participatory notes and diversions through tax havens remain untouched. There is no attempt to curb the roots of generation of black money such as in the real estate sector.”
“The Government of India/RBI should allow district and primary cooperative banks also to accept and exchange Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. This will provide much relief to people in the rural areas.”
The CPI(M) demanded that till alternative arrangements like the availability of required currency notes and the recalibration of ATM machines are completed, people should be allowed to transact in old notes.

2016-11-16 17:15:00,"Demonetisation is in national interest, govt. says in Rajya Sabha","Facing opposition onslaught, the government on Wednesday put up a strong defence in the Rajya Sabha on demonetisation, saying the step was taken in national interest to end corruption and black money, which it is said is also used for terror activities in the country.
Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who spoke on behalf of the ruling side after Congress leader Anand Sharma slammed the government, rejected as baseless the Opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems.
“There is no politics in it. It is a step taken in national interest,” he said, adding the step would help the country in the long run.
“If anyone has the strength to take on black money and corruption, it is the BJP government and Narendra Modi,” the Minister said.
He claimed that common people are out in support of the government’s move which is aimed against graft and terror and that the step will lead to curbing inflation and tax rate may come down.
Mr. Goyal claimed that the country has welcomed this initiative of the Modi government and it was natural that some people who have black money and are indulging in corruption and black money are worried about it.
“
Desh me imandaar ka samman hua hai aur be—imaan ka nuksaan hua hai, [The honest have been honoured and the dishonest have faced losses],” he said.
“I am confident that public is understanding the initial problems because the decision was kept a secret. No honest tax-payer will lose a single rupee. The loss will be of those who have amassed wealth through corruption and black money and the public should also support the government in the move,” he said.
Mr. Goyal said some pain and difficulty in the implementation of such a decision was inevitable but despite that the people have strongly supported the move.
He urged all the parties to support the move so that the House gave a message to the country that all are against corruption and black money.
To Mr. Sharma’s charge that those questioning the government were labelled as anti-national, he said, “Understandably if someone opposes it [demonetisation], questions will be raised on whether they are against ending the menace of corruption and black money in the country.”
Taking a dig at the Opposition, he said, “We thought all political parties will support us in Parliament. But for some reasons they have opposed the move. It seems they are worried due to the large public favouring it and supporting the government despite the problems being faced by them.”
Mr. Goyal said the BJP had put out its poll expenses on the website and after this step all would think before indulging in corruption and black marketing.
Mr. Goyal said when the NDA government assumed charge in 2014, the country was embroiled in corruption and scams. Now the Modi government had taken a step, through which he had met the “expectations” of the people, the Minister added.
“There are some people who are unhappy over it. This is an important step in the war against graft, terror and drugs and political parties should be happy over it,” he said.
Mr. Goyal also claimed that from the documents and reports available, the RBI had realised that a large quantum of money was not circulating or coming to the chests and analysed that this money was hidden.
“Now the government cannot give a specific figure for this. But the RBI gave a proposal to the government and it came before the Cabinet, which approved the move,” he said.
“There is no curb on honestly-earned money. So nobody should have a problem,” he said.
Responding to issues raised by the Opposition, Mr. Goyal said some people were saying that seven or 10 days’ time should have been given. “Secrecy is most important for such a step,” he noted.
Listing the benefits of the move, Mr. Goyal said interest rates would come down, inflation would be curbed and even the tax rate would come down.
“If 5 people don’t pay tax, the brunt is borne by the rest of 95 per cent people. And if taxes are paid, there will be more money with the Centre to carry out welfare works for farmers, women, SC and ST sections,” he said.
With regard to allegations that the move was timed to benefit the BJP in the U.P. elections, he said such a statement itself implied that people supported this step.
To demands that the government should declare the names of people who have Swiss Bank accounts, he said such a step would make it difficult for the government to obtain more information about such accounts.
But some people wanted the government to make the error of declaring these names and then it would have difficulty in getting this information, Mr. Goyal claimed.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-is-in-national-interest-govt.-says-in-Rajya-Sabha/article16643784.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-16 01:02:00,"No banks, no ATMs. How a Sunderbans island survives in the time of demonetisation "," Over the past week, little cash has changed hands at Ghoramara, an island in the Sunderbans, that has no banks or ATMs. The boatman, the shopkeeper, the fish seller, and the woman running the ICDS centre use credit. 
Ghoramara, which sits at the Hooghly’s meeting point with the Bay of Bengal, is famously sinking, slowly claimed by the sea. It has over 5,000 people and is one of West Bengal’s 700 gram panchayats without a banking facility. 
During a 30-minute boat ride, Kalipada Karak, who runs Ghoramara Ferry Service, complains of a drop in passengers and flashes a yellow token that he is giving passengers instead of change. 
“When someone gives me a 10-rupee note, I give this in return,” the boatman says. Rubi Mete, who runs the island’s ICDS centre serving 72 people including 51 children and 13 pregnant and nursing mothers, has to ensure food for a big group.
“There is no bank. I need at least Rs. 150 to go to Sagar (another island) to withdraw cash, but I don’t have that much money,” she says.
Ms. Mete has kept the centre going with public support — shopkeepers who sell on credit and villagers who offer produce on deferred payment. 
The creditors include Kanai Lal Guchait, who has a small shop in Bagbazar area and has sold Rs. 1,500 worth of goods since morning. He expects that the credit will keep rising. 
“This has been the story since Wednesday. I had some Rs. 500 notes, but had to go to Namkhana to get them exchanged,” Mr. Guchait said, showing a notebook where he has recorded every transaction. A few metres away, Amit Karak has spread fish for sale. No customers come and he pleads with Sankar Giri, another villager, to buy some fish on credit. Giri, who came to Karak’s rescue, points out that even if islanders want to help, they cannot. 
Mr. Giri owns a betel plantation and the leaves are sold on the mainland. “We got Rs. 300 for a bundle of 100 leaves, but now no one is willing to pay even Rs. 100,” he laments. Ghoramara has a post office — the only place to deposit currency and make withdrawals. On Monday, it was closed for Guru Nanak Jayanti. Abhimanyu Mondal, the manager, says, “I have got 1.15 lakh rupees in denominations of 500 and 1,000. I have to record the number of every note before they are deposited at subdivision headquarters.”

The demonstration, led by DCC president Venugopal Reddy here on Wednesday, sought to highlight the inconvenience caused to the general public, particularly the vendors, small traders and other members of the working class, who are unable to exchange high denomination notes for buying regular livelihood items and continuing their normal trade. 
“Their [small traders/vendors] business have been dull since the announcement, with not many customers purchasing the products owing to the high value notes and lack of subsequent currency for exchange. How can the government justify their act if the working class, who depend on their daily business, are the worst affected?” he questioned. Terming the current demonetisation as a ‘move which was not well thought out’ [by the Central government], the activists alleged Prime Minster Narendra Modi has been supporting industrialists like Ambanis, Adani etc., at the cost of the common man. They later unveiled a flex banner highlighting the same message pictorially with a tagline - ‘Nalla Kuberulaki Pattam Kattina PM’. 
Meanwhile, members of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) staged a protest at the premises of the State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) near the Municipal Office Circle. Highlighting the issues faced by daily wage workers, AITUC general secretary Murali said the workers had not received wages for the past few days and expressed their inability to buy essential commodities. They further demanded that the government increase the availability of ₹ 100 notes, round-the-clock ATMs and extension of the date for depositing money in bank till December 31.

Laying a siege to the main road leading to the RTC bus station, the party activists raised slogans against the Centre for “throwing life out of gear and causing serious dent to the nation’s economy.”

‘Centre to blame’

Mr. Reddy said the Centre should be held responsible for the loss of livelihood of the poor, loss of lives in hospitals for want of money and imminent fall in the GDP due to the exercise.
“Tens of thousands of man hours are wasted as people are made to stand in queues to exchange, deposit, and withdraw currency notes. The government should have thought of a hassle-free system before introducing the rule,” he said.
While stating that the party was not against the motto behind the exercise, Mr. Karunakar Reddy said they were against the “haphazard” manner in which it was taken up.
He rebuked “Modi supporters” of muzzling criticism in the garb of nationalism and terming detractors as “anti-national.”
He was later taken into custody by the Tirupati East police.

Congress stages dharna

Congress workers, led by former MP Chinta Mohan, too staged a dharna at the Potti Sriramulu Circle near the SVRR Government General Hospital.
He took exception to the way the Central government was “playing” with the lives of the poor and middle class, while ignoring the super rich, who had actually hoarded unaccounted money. Referring to the people running from pillar to post for exchanging their old currency notes, Dr. Mohan wondered if it was the “Acche Din” promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“People across the country are suffering, but the Centre is blind to this fact. This government does not want to see the truth,” he charged. He was taken into custody for burning the effigy of the Prime Minister and was housed in the Alipiri police station.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-unscientific-says-YSRC/article16643663.ece,TIRUPATI
2016-11-16 01:00:00,SC refuses to stay demonetisation ," The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stay the November 8 government notification demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes and asked the Centre to take immediate measures to alleviate the sufferings of the traumatised common man who is “forced” to stand in queues to withdraw a little bit of his own hard-earned money.
“Tell us, instead of forcing citizens to stand in queues for his own money ... and it is traumatic for people to stand in lines for hours doing nothing, why can’t you raise their cash withdrawal limit to a reasonable one,” Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, who presided over a Bench that comprised Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, questioned the Centre.
Noting that the court did not want to interfere with the government’s economic policy, Chief Justice Thakur said the objective of demonetisation might be a “surgical strike” on black money, but it should not cause hardship to the common man.
Chief Justice Thakur summarised that while the government calls the demonestisation exercise a “surgical strike on black money,” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of the four petitioners, terms it a “carpet-bombing of the common man.”
“Carpenters, masons, daily wage earners, maids, vegetable sellers are dependent on cash; we are only wondering if you are capable of doing anything to reduce the trauma of ordinary man,” Chief Justice Thakur asked Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi.
The Bench asked the Centre to file an affidavit by November 25, detailing the various measures it could take to lessen the hardship and inconvenience caused to people without hindering the larger objective of the government notification to get rid of black money and cross-border terror financing.

Making use of the deadline (earlier November 14) extended by the Union government on accepting old currency notes, the corporation decided to open two special counters in each one of the 12 zonal offices and also at Hubballi-Dharwad One centres located at various places in the twin cities. Municipal Commissioner Major Siddalingaiah Hiremath had announced that payments towards property tax, stallage fee, advertisement fee and other fees pertaining to various permissions of the corporation would be accepted at the special counters.
The announcement by the municipal corporation received an overwhelming response from tax payers and on Sunday and Monday, the special counters and Hubballi-Dharwad One centres operated from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. They received a a collection of Rs. 3.26 crore, in all.
“It is a record of sorts for the municipal corporation. Within two days, we have received payments running into Rs. 3,26,54,275. While Rs. 94,33,593 was received at the special counters, the Hubballi-Dharwad One centres received Rs. 2,32,20,682 till Monday 8 p.m.,” Major Hiremath told The Hindu.
The Municipal Commissioner said that as per the initial assessment, a major portion of the payments received were towards pending bills.

2016-11-16 18:48:00,"Demonetisation, an indirect boost to temperance drive "," Demonetisation seems to be working in the State where efforts at temperance have failed. Sale of liquor at the State-owned outlets of Bevco and Consumerfed has drastically come down in the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denomination currency notes were no longer legal tender. 
“The daily loss is Rs.4 crore to Rs.5 crore,” says H. Venkatesh, managing director of Kerala State Beverages (Manufacturing and Marketing) Corporation Ltd (Bevco).
Sales of liquor from November 9 to 14 last year amounted to Rs.153.02 crore. The sum is Rs.140.45 crore in the corresponding period this year. Taking into account the recent increase in prices of most liquor brands, the drop in sales is high. 
“The currency crisis has led to plummeting of sales, and we are anticipating further losses if the demonetisation drive continues. The revenue is expected to go down further as the Sabarimala season began on Wednesday,” Mr. Venkatesh says.
Bevco has 270 outlets and Consumerfed, 36, including beer and wine shops. These apart, Bevco runs 20 premium outlets. Sales of Indian-made foreign liquor and beer have been buoying up the State exchequer, with earnings of Rs.11,577 crore during 2015-16. The National Sample Survey Office figures say the per-capita consumption of liquor in the State is 196 ml a week, or 10.2 litres a year.

“Now we have asked the government to amend the Kerala Abkari Act so that Bevco outlets, at least the premium shops, can accept cards,” Mr. Venkatesh says.

Speaking at the demonstration, former MLA Balabharathi, district secretary Pandi and others said if the BJP-led government was really interested in abolishing black money and bringing the guilty to book, what was the necessity to discontinue the currency notes. Income Tax officials should be entrusted with the task of conducting raids on those having huge amounts of unaccounted money.

Village-level Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) draw funds from their accounts with District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs). Strictly speaking, they are not regarded as banks, even though they can accept deposits and issue loans.

This means that each Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Society can draw only Rs. 24,000 per week from the DCCB concerned. 
Against this background, fulfilling the target set by the State government for the disbursal of crop loans of Rs. 6,000 crore through all societies becomes next to impossible, say officials. 
In 2015-2016, crop loans of about Rs.5,868 crore were disbursed, against the target of Rs. 5,500 crore. About 10.75 lakh farmers were benefited.
This year, around 35 per cent of the targeted amount has been achieved. The disbursal will gather pace in the coming two months as farmers will be intensifying their operations during the current Samba season The officials are also wondering as to how to meet the deadline of November 30 to ensure that the crop loans are covered under the new crop insurance scheme — Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. 
On the one hand, village-level cooperative societies are hamstrung by the demonetisation scheme. On the other hand, the deadline for coverage under the crop insurance scheme is approaching. What has complicated the situation further is the latest ban on the District Central Cooperative Banks accepting the demonetised notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 for exchange or deposit. 
The RBI should exempt the village-level credit societies from various restrictions so that the latter’s operations are carried on smoothly, the officials explain.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-affects-disbursal-of-crop-loans/article16446981.ece,CHENNAI
2016-11-16 00:00:00,Industries welcome demonetisation policy,"Various stakeholders in business and industries here have welcomed the demonetisation policy.
Hailing the “bold initiative”, P.S.S.K. Raja Sankaralingam, former president, All India Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Thoothukudi, said it was a holistic approach towards development and to make India free from black money. He observed that though people had to face hardship for want of money to meet their daily expenses, the situation would improve as more avenues would be opened to withdraw money.
The recent demonetisation policy had not affected the shipping industry. According to J.P. Joe Villavarayar, former chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry, Thoothukudi, cargo shipping operations had not been affected as payments were being made in the form of cheques.
Moreover, the logistic supply operations, the key to shipping industry, remained unaffected as cargo trucks had been transporting shipments as usual. No toll charge was being levied on cargo trucks and other vehicles on national highways since the government had relaxed it till November 18. It was also a healthy sign that demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would be accepted in all fuel stations for a certain period, he said.
Suresh Nandanwar, Additional Commissioner of Customs, Tuticorin Custom House, told The Hindu that operations were normal in the Custom House as proceedings here were being done through online payment.
Hailing the policy, K. Nehruprakash, vice-president, Thoothukudi District Tiny and Small-Scale Industries Association (THUDITSSIA), said the move would deliver long-term benefit for people.
The demonetisation policy was expected to boost the economy and industrial raw material cost could be reduced possibly.
However, he said that most of the ATMs remained closed and only a few had cash. Since people were accustomed to withdrawing money from the ATMs, they faced some problems but as the ceiling of cash withdrawal from banks had been revised, it had come as a welcome relief, he added.
Reliable sources from banks here said many the ATMS required re-calibration and it would take a minimum of a week to restore normal operations. Cash was being fed in the ATMs based on priority considering its transactions.
In banks, operations were predominantly on money exchange, cash deposits and remittance. Despite being understaffed, bankers were discharging their duty.
Moreover, people had been asked not to handle others’ cash in banks and any such act would be penalised, sources said.

2016-11-16 23:46:00,Demonetisation dominates Chhattisgarh Assembly," The Narendra Modi government’s decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes dominated the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly for the second consecutive day on Wednesday.
The House had witnessed uproar several times on Tuesday over the issue and saw five adjournments.
The Chhattisgarh Chief Minister, Raman Singh, had submitted a proposal to “congratulate” the central government “on the historic decision” before the House, however, the main opposition party, the Congress, demanded that it be allowed to take part in the discussion.
The BJP MLAs backed the demonetisation move, whereas the Congress leaders called it an “attempt by the central government to hide its inability to bring back black money stashed abroad.”
“People all over the country are panicked due to this move. A farmer from Raigarh district went to bank thrice but he could not get money which he desperately needed for his children. In the end, he killed himself. We are against black money but why is the government troubling common people who have nothing to do with the black money? The way you have taken up this process has only troubled the common man. Take back this decision and bring it only when you are completely prepared,” Chhattisgarh Congress president, Bhupesh Baghel, said.
Many BJP leaders also conceded that common people were facing temporary inconvenience due to demonetisation.
The House also witnessed heated verbal exchanges between the opposition and the treasury benches.
“Marriages are being canceled for the scarcity of cash. The chief minister has the finance portfolio here, why did he not think of inconvenience to the people by this move? The situation is getting worse in rural areas of the State,” senior Congress MLA, Satyanarayn Sharma, said.
Accepting that inconvenience would be caused for a few days, BJP MLA Shrichan Sundarani, claimed that the people of the country have made up their mind to “strengthen the economy.”
Parliamentary affair minister, Ajay Chandrakar, furiously defended the demonetisation and recounted the measures taken by the government to avoid hardship to the common public.
However, the opposition was not satisfied and the leader of opposition T.S. Singh Deo refused to support the government in “this gamble.”
CM Raman Singh equated the demonetisation decision to Indira Gandhi’s support to the formation of Bangladesh.
He claimed that “96 per cent” of the country were sleeping peacefully and only “four percent” with black money were sleepless because of the “bold and daring decision of the PM.”
“If our jawans can stand on the border for days to protect us why can’t we stand in line for four hours to strengthen our economy? This decision has destroyed the terror and Maoist funding,” he said, adding that his government has taken all necessary precautions to help the people of the State.
However, Mr. Singh’s speech was repeatedly disrupted by Congress MLAs who demanded the division of vote on the “proposal of congratulation” to the Central government.
The vote division went in favour of the government by 16 votes.",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Demonetisation-dominates-Chhattisgarh-Assembly/article16459579.ece,Raipur
2016-11-16 01:48:00,"No banks, no ATMs. How a Sunderbans island survives in the time of demonetisation","Over the past week, little cash has changed hands at Ghoramara, an island in the Sunderbans, which has no banks or ATMs. The boatman, the shopkeeper, the fish seller, and the woman running the ICDS centre use credit.
Ghoramara, which sits at the Hooghly’s meeting point with the Bay of Bengal, is famously sinking, slowly claimed by the sea. It has over 5,000 people and is one of West Bengal’s 700 gram panchayats without a banking facility.
During a 30-minute boat ride, Kalipada Karak, who runs the Ghoramara Ferry Service, complains of a drop in passengers and flashes a yellow token that he is giving passengers instead of change.
“When someone gives me a 10-rupee note, I give this in return,” the boatman says. Rubi Mete, who runs the island’s ICDS centre serving 72 people, including 51 children and 13 pregnant and nursing mothers, has to ensure food for a big group.
“There is no bank. I need at least Rs. 150 to go to Sagar [another island] to withdraw cash, but I don’t have that much money,” she says.
Ms. Mete has kept the centre going with public support — shopkeepers who sell on credit and villagers who offer produce on deferred payment.
The creditors include Kanai Lal Guchait, who has a small shop in Bagbazar area and has sold Rs. 1,500 worth of goods since morning. He expects that the credit will keep rising.
“This has been the story since Wednesday. I had some Rs. 500 notes, but had to go to Namkhana to get them exchanged,” Mr. Guchait said, showing a notebook where he has recorded every transaction. A few metres away, Amit Karak has spread fish for sale. No customers come and he pleads with Sankar Giri, another villager, to buy some fish on credit. Giri, who came to Karak’s rescue, points out that even if islanders want to help, they cannot.

Betel leaves wilt

Mr. Giri owns a betel plantation and the leaves are sold on the mainland. “We got Rs. 300 for a bundle of 100 leaves, but now no one is willing to pay even Rs. 100,” he laments. Ghoramara has a post office — the only place to deposit currency and make withdrawals. On Monday, it was closed for Guru Nanak Jayanti. Abhimanyu Mondal, the manager, says, “I have got 1.15 lakh rupees in denominations of 500 and 1,000. I have to record the number of every note before they are deposited at subdivision headquarters.”",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/No-banks-no-ATMs.-How-a-Sunderbans-island-survives-in-the-time-of-demonetisation/article16643776.ece,Ghoramara (Sunderbans)

According to Malkangiri Superintendent of Police (SP) Mitrabhanu Mohapatra, the police had received intelligence reports that Maoists were trying to deposit their stock of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes in Jan Dhan accounts of poor tribals through threats or other means. To check this attempt of ultras, all banks have been directed to keep a watch on the huge deposits being made in Jan Dhan accounts. “There is extra watch on persons coming from cut off area of Chitrakonda reservoir”, he said.
On Tuesday, a tribal, who had come to deposit Rs1.30 lakh at Chitrakonda branch of State Bank of India (SBI) was detained by the police and taken for interrogation to ascertain source of the cash. A long queue of tribals was seen at this bank branch who were holding large quantity of cash in the form of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes.
Security has also been strengthened at bank branches and ATM counters in Maoist-prone district as there is fear that ultras may also try to loot new currency notes during their transportation or from banks.

The main opposition party the Congress raised the issue of a suicide by a farmer in Raigarh district of the state allegedly due to frustration caused by the demonetization move.
Led by the state Congress president Mr. Bhupesh Baghel, the Congress MLAs demanded discussion under adjournment motion on the “panicky situation” caused by the demonetization.
“Sixteen people have died across the country and one farmer has committed suicide in Chhattisgarh because of this move. People are not able to use their own hard-earned money,” said Mr.Baghel on the day when the Raman Singh government planned to “congratulate” the Narendra Modi government on its move.
The Speaker of the house Mr.Gourishankar Agrawal, however, refused permission to the opposition after which the Congress MLAs resorted to sloganeering and forced five adjournments during the day.
The Chhattisgarh Janata Congress MLA Amit Jogi and his supporter Congress MLA Siyaram Kaushik and R.K.Rai trooped to the well of the house in protest of the demonetization and the alleged suicide of former Ravi Pradhan from Raigarh.
The three MLAs were suspended from the house as per its rule which suspends anyone who protests in the well of the house.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Amit Jogi came to the Assembly on a bullock cart in protest of the “anti-poor” policies of the Raman Singh government.
The opposition and the treasury benches witnessed sharp verbal exchanges throughout the day and hardly any business could be transacted as the Congress did not even allow the question hour.
The house was adjourned for the day after the government allowed the opposition to participate in the discussion “to Congratulate “ the central government on demonetisation on Wednesday.

2016-11-16 00:00:00,‘Demonetisation move anti-poor’,"The BSP in Punjab on Tuesday termed “anti-poor step” the demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 currency notes, saying the move was taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to divert public attention from his failure to bring back the black money stashed abroad.
The BSP’s Punjab in-charge and party candidate from Phillaur for 2017 Assembly polls, Avtar Singh Karimpuri also said that the Modi government’s move had subjected common man, especially the poor, to huge hardships.
“Modi had failed miserably to fulfil the much tom-tommed poll promise of bringing back black money stashed in foreign banks. He had resorted to demonetisation (of high value currency notes) for diverting public attention from the failure as well as with an eye on upcoming Assembly polls in some States,” he said.
The former Rajya Sabha Member also said that the move is “destined to backfire”.
Earlier, addressing a rally organised here by the BSP’s NRI supporters, Mr Karimpuri said if his party comes to power in Punjab, it will make the State free from corruption and drugs.

2016-11-16 20:06:00,Labour-intensive industries feel pinch of demonetisation ," Labour-intensive industries in Thoothukudi district have been affected by the recent demonetisation of higher value currency notes, as they are not able to pay wages to their workers. 
The traditional safety match industry, though largely mechanised, relied on labourers, J. Devadoss, secretary, South India Match Manufacturers’ Association, Kovilpatti told The Hindu on Wednesday. Around one lakh workers had been relying on this industry. Wages would normally be paid once a week based on productivity. The cash withdrawal allowed after demonetisation was inadequate to pay wages to labourers.’
The cash withdrawal limit had been limited to Rs.24,000 for a week for savings account holders and Rs.50,000 for current account holders. The ceiling should be increased to facilitate payment of salaries to employees. Presently the labourers had been managing their day-to-day expenses with the Deepavali bonus and last month salary, Mr. Devadoss said.
Moreover, traders from North India were reluctant to place orders for match boxes as they were used to cash transactions only. Movement of finished goods to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha had come to a halt in the last one week, he said.
Salt industry had also been facing a setback as stocks of manufactured salt could not be transported. According to A.R.A.S. Dhanabalan, secretary, Thoothukudi Small Scale Salt Manufacturers’ Association, salt production was stopped with the onset of monsoon in October-end. Normally, there would a demand for salt during rainy season, but not this year, he said. Despite achieving high production this year, the product could not be marketed because of demonetisation. 
M.S.P. Thenraj, president, Thoothukudi Salt Traders’ Association, said there was a slowdown in the trade as employers could not pay wages to labourers engaged in packing and loading. 
 Since lorry drivers and attendants could not be paid, only 20 per cent to 30 per cent trucks were being operated, that too on short distance routes, S. Varadharajan, secretary, Tuticorin District Container Truck Owners’ Association, said. Though truck operators had been exempted from paying toll until November 18 and demonetised notes were valid till November 24, the lorry crew needed money to buy food.
The Rs. 2,000 notes could not be given to them as they would find it difficult to get change. Had the authorities released new Rs.500 notes earlier, this crisis could have been better managed, he said. 
Many ice plant owners were also feeling the pinch as suspension of mechanised boat fishing operations after the demonetisation exercise had forced them to stop production.

However, they believe that demonetisation and the push for digital payments will boost the sector in the long run, especially since CoD orders being returned is one of their biggest “pain-points.”
As per industry estimates, the cost for CoD returns is about Rs.20 in urban areas and about Rs.75 for non-urban locations.
Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl said CoD orders on its platform had come down to 30 per cent of the overall sales. “After the announcement, COD orders have declined to 30 per cent of our sales from 50 per cent,” he said at an event by Digital India Foundation.
Mr.Bahl said that higher adoption of digital payments would help improve unit economics for e-commerce companies in the long run. “From an economics perspective, it is positive for e-commerce firms, as CoD returns are a big pain point from an economic and logistics perspective. That will also get significantly mitigated going forward as more payments move to digital,” he pointed out.
The surge in digital paymentswill come down once cash comes into the system, but the “equilibrium will settle at higher level than when we entered the demonetisation phase,” he said.
Shopclues co-founder and CEO Sanjay Sethi said in the first four days the company saw a decline of about 15 per cent. “Overall, we saw a decline of about 7 per cent for our orders,” he said. Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal, who attended the event via video call, said, “There was a drop in sales when the announcement was made. There were cancellations of CoD orders but it’s recovering now.” Following the demonetisation, some companies like Amazon had temporarily halted CoD facility, while others like Flipkart and Snapdeal had put a cap on the value of orders that could be delivered through the service.",Industry,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/E-commerce-firms-see-30-decline-in-cash-on-delivery-orders-post-demonetisation/article16643826.ece,NEW DELHI

Later in the evening, the committee members met the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor, Urjit Patel, government sources told The Hindu .
“My demand to the Governor would be to increase the withdrawal limits at banks and allow cooperative banks to exchange old notes for the time being. The agenda of our government is to give some relief from queues and chaos,” Mr. Mungantiwar said.
He confirmed that the members presented a slew of demands, chief among them being to allow cooperative banks to accept old currency notes. “The Minister has received complaints from rural areas, including from former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had said that cooperative banks are not doing any transactions whatsoever,” a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister said.
Sources said several ministers had expressed similar concerns at the State Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “We have asked the Chief Minister to allow use of old notes at the APMC markets so that perishable goods are not affected. We have also asked the CM to allow school students to pay fees late,” said another minister. The Cabinet discussed the existing situation; this was followed by a presentation by finance secretary D.K. Jain.
The sub-committee assigned to study the problems faced by the people will submit a report to the Centre. The committee consisting of Mr. Mungantiwar, Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar, Transport Minister Diwakar Raote, Health Minister Deepak Sawant, Education Minister Vinod Tawde and Industries Minister Subhash Desai, discussed fallout of demonetisation on the agriculture markets and insurance/loans to farmers.

2016-11-16 00:00:00,Demonetisation affects disbursal of crop loans,"The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has delivered a body blow to disbursal of crop loans through cooperative institutions in Tamil Nadu at a time when it is about to gather momentum.
Village-level Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) draw funds from their accounts with District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs). Strictly speaking, they are not regarded as banks, even though they can accept deposits and issue loans. In Tamil Nadu, there are 4,480 PACCS, which during 2015-2016, mobilised Rs. 6,874.66 crore and disbursed loans to the tune of Rs. 19,409.52 crore.
For all practical purposes, such societies are equated with any other “individual bank customer”.
This means that each Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Society can draw only Rs. 24,000 per week from the DCCB concerned.
Against this background, fulfilling the target set by the State government for the disbursal of crop loans of Rs. 6,000 crore through all societies becomes next to impossible, say officials.
In 2015-2016, crop loans of about Rs.5,868 crore were disbursed, against the target of Rs. 5,500 crore. About 10.75 lakh farmers were benefited.

What has complicated the situation further is the latest ban on the District Central Cooperative Banks accepting the demonetised notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 for exchange or deposit.

The Rajya Sabha, meanwhile, was repeatedly adjourned, as the Congress-led Opposition mounted a sharp and relentless attack on the government: this was in sharp contrast to the peaceful discussion on Wednesday.
In the Upper House, the Opposition made it clear it was not satisfied merely with responses from Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, even as remarks made by Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad about the Uri terror attack in the context of demonetisation forced the final adjournment for the day.
The Lok Sabha on Thursday witnessed continuous disruptions before being adjourned for the day, with Speaker Sumitra Mahajan turning down the Opposition’s demand for an adjournment motion on the demonetisation issue.
As soon as the proceedings started, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanded that the Chair accept the adjournment motion but Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar said the government was only ready for a debate under Rule 193. Neither side yielded, and the Congress and other Opposition MPs continued to shout slogans.
Ms. Mahajan then said Opposition MPs did not seem to want a discussion and only sought to disrupt the House. Eventually, the House was adjourned till 12.30 p.m.
When the Lok Sabha reassembled, Mr. Kharge again raised the demand for an adjournment motion.
Ms. Mahajan simply said, “I have disallowed the adjournment.” The uproar continued unabated, and the Speaker adjourned the House for the day.

Appearing for the Centre before a Bench led by Justice Anil R. Dave, Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi submitted that when the Supreme Court was already seized of the matter, other courts should not preside over separate litigation on an identical issue.
The Supreme Court had, earlier this week, refused to stay the November 8 notification demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.
It had however asked the Centre to take immediate measures to alleviate the hardships of the common man who is “forced” to stand in queues to withdraw a little bit of his own hard-earned money.
“Instead of forcing citizens to stand in queues for his own money ... and it is traumatic for people to stand in lines for hours doing nothing, why can’t you raise their cash withdrawal limit to a reasonable one?” Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, who presided over a Bench that comprised Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, had questioned the Centre.

The Treasury benches termed the remark as “anti-national” and wanted an apology from the Congress.
Heated exchanges broke out between the Treasury and Opposition benches after Mr. Azad said 40 people had died following the government’s decision on demonetisation and that these many casualties had not occurred even in the terror attack on the Uri Army camp. Eighteen Army personnel were killed in that attack.
“Who should be punished” for the death of these 40 people which occurred due to the “wrong policy” on demonetisation, he asked and added that “millions of people are troubled. BJP and Government is responsible”.
This comment by Mr. Azad drew massive protests from BJP members with Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu saying the remarks are “anti-national”.
An angry Mr. Naidu said Pakistan would use these comments against India and that the Congress should apologise for it.
He also requested Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien to expunge the remarks.

2016-11-17 19:16:00,," The demonetisation of high value currency notes has apparently led to considerable disruption in rural and agrarian economy where cash-based dealings are a norm. A week after the announcement of the removal of existing currency notes of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500, farmers and agriculture labourers are struggling on the streets to get cash to lead their day to day lives. 
Majority of agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs) are shut as hardly any trading is taking place because farmers have produce but have no buyers. Except perishable items like fruits and vegetables, no trading is happening for grains, groundnut and cottons in any place across Gujarat where there are 207 APMC. 
""There is no trading in any APMC except perishable items like fruit and vegetables. There is no clarity also regarding when the trading will begin,"" said an officer bearer of Junagadh APMC. According to him, farmers don’t have money to even buy seeds or fertilizers and pay to labourers as new sowing season has begun. 
On Wednesday, the Gujarat government announced that the farmers can buy fertilizers from the dealers and depo of Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizer and Chemicals (GNFC) and Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals (GSFC) and also IFFCO. 
""The issue is farmers are not used to deal in cash as less than five per cent farmers use cheque for making or receiving payments,"" said Veljibhai Patel, a farmer from Viramgam town near Ahmedabad. 
""The rural economy has completely collapsed due to demonetization and also liquidity crunch. I want to sell cotton but there is no buyer in the APMC of cotton mill,"" said former Congress parliamentarian Virji Thummar, who is also chairman of Gujarat Congress Farmers cell. 
The Gujarat government has requested the central government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow the district cooperative banks to accept deposit and exchange of old notes which has been prohibited by the RBI fearing large scale money laundering. 
In Gujarat, there are 18 district cooperative banks which have more than 1000 branches catering to millions of farmers. 
According to a senior leader of the ruling party BJP in Gujarat, if the situation does not improve by next week, there will be many issues. ""So far, despite problems, public has cooperated but you cannot rule out problems if the situation persists for a few more days,"" he cautioned.

2016-11-17 17:20:00,Narendra Modi won’t reply to demonetisation debate in Parliament: Venkaiah,"The government on Thursday rejected the demand for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s response to the debate on demonetisation and accused the Opposition of using it as an excuse to scuttle discussion on the issue in Parliament.
Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu told reporters after Parliament was adjourned for the day, amid protests by Opposition demanding Mr. Modi’s presence, that the reply to the debate would be given by the Minister concerned or any other person on behalf of the government as per the rules of the House and precedents.
The Opposition disrupted the Rajya Sabha, stalling midway the discussion on demonetisation that started on Wednesday.
A united opposition’s relentless demand for a debate on demonetisation under a rule which entails voting forced the adjournment of the Lok Sabha also for the day as the government refused to accept it.
“Half way through, they realised that by raising such a debate it is going negative on them and boomeranging. Now I am afraid, are they trying to find a way out to come out of this and then stall the debate on one pretext or the other,” Mr. Naidu said.
Dubbing the uproar by the Congress and other Opposition parties as an “excuse” to stall a debate, Mr. Naidu alleged that there is no rationale, whatsoever, behind it.
The Minister said things will happen as per the rules and procedures of the House and urged that the debate should go on.
“I feel that those who started the debate are now understanding that it is going negative, that is why they are finding excuse for not allowing the discussion.
“They are speaking in double tone and in different voices. They are not coming out openly either for or against. They are in dilemma and that dilemma will continue,” he said.
Mr. Naidu said the entire country is watching as to who are with the hoarders and with the people with black money and who are with the government and the Prime Minister, who has “taken such a revolutionary step. They have to make a choice”.
“Let the discussion take place. Then who will reply in the government. It could be the concerned Minister. The solution will come through the government as per traditions and rules,” he said.
Mr. Naidu said government is addressing the problems faced by people on demonetisation and any suggestion, if worth considering, will be take up positively.
“Government is open to ideas to improve the system. But if somebody is trying to question this and attribute motives, then people are there to finally come to an assessment and decide.

2016-11-17 13:15:00,"Now, Gates has ‘no opinion’ on demonetisation","A day after he described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s November 8 decision to withdraw 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation as a “bold move”, billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates said on Thursday he had “no opinion” on the issue.
In a NITI Aayog lecture on Wednesday, Mr. Gates described Mr. Modi’s decision as an “important step” to move away from a “shadow economy to an even more transparent economy”.
To a specific question from The Hindu on Thursday at a select media roundtable on whether he supported demonetisation, Mr. Gates stated that he had “no opinion” on the issue.
Mr. Gates, however, predicted that India would go digital very rapidly and pointed to the process in countries like Kenya, where his foundation had worked. Government payments alone justified the digital path in India, he stressed.
When a reporter pointed out that India was a cash dependent economy, Mr. Gates responded: “That’s true”. He also felt that the Aadhaar, or India’s identity card system, was a “fantastic thing”.
In his Wednesday lecture, Mr. Gates said digital transactions would rise dramatically in India. “I think in the next several years India will become the most digitised economy. Not just by size but percentage as well.”
Mr. Gates was of the view that Aadhaar had not been attempted anywhere in the world, including in rich countries. “But now you have something that is going to underlie all your digital systems, whether it’s banking, tax payments, tracking healthcare records.”
On the reported decline in healthcare spending by the government, Mr. Gates said the spending had been flat. Advocating an increase in healthcare spending, he said in the end this was a political question and he wasn’t a voter in India.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Now-Gates-has-%E2%80%98no-opinion%E2%80%99-on-demonetisation/article16644671.ece,NEW DELHI

2016-11-17 22:34:00,Tirumala temple untouchedby demonetisation storm ," The pilgrim rush continues at the world-famous Lord Venkateswara temple even after the demonetisation of high-value currency by the Centre. Offerings too continue to pour into the hundi.
The hill town has recorded over 5.13 lakh footfalls in the last eight days aggregating an average of 64,176 pilgrims per day. Likewise, the hundi has also registered a whopping income of over Rs. 22.9 crore.
But several other renowned temples in the State have been hit hard. 
A report by the Endowments Department suggests that there is a decline by 10-25 per cent in the number of people undertaking pilgrimages to various places of worship. The temple at Sri Kalahasti has reported a drastic decline in the number of devotees performing the ‘Rahu-Kethu’ pooja – to which the devout attach immense significance, and the Srisailam temple has recorded an erosion by over 20 per cent in the number of pilgrims. 
Meanwhile, speculation continues to persist that the Tirumala temple which is known for its vast riches, will remain the ultimate beneficiary of the withdrawal of the legal tender status for Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes. 
The hundi, which nets an income of more than Rs. 1,000 crore in the form of offerings in addition to about one tonne of gold and three to four tonnes of silver articles year among other valuables, in all probability is expected to receive voluminous deposits either during the last couple of weeks of December when the deadline for exchange and deposits of the old currency notes expires or by the end of March as specified by the Reserve Bank of India.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Tirumala-temple-untouchedby-demonetisation-storm/article16507964.ece,TIRUMALA
2016-11-17 01:56:00,Demonetisation: Opposition divided over strategy,"A majority of the Opposition parties are united in their belief that the demonetisation move is causing great hardship to the poor and vulnerable, but the Trinamool Congress is possibly the only political party seeking a complete rollback.
This became clear when Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee — who led a protest march to Rashtrapati Bhavan on demonetisation — was accompanied only by the National Conference, a rebel AAP MP and the Shiv Sena, which made it clear that it did not want a rollback.
These differences between the Trinamool and other Opposition parties on demonetisation — the Congress, the Left parties, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Janata Dal-United, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party — will play out over the next few days.
For instance, the Congress-led group sought a Joint Parliamentary Committee and an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha and a discussion under Rule 267 in the Rajya Sabha. The government promptly accepted it as it gave it the opportunity to present the demonetisation measure to a wider audience as one that would cleanse the economy.
While the Congress-led group will discuss their next move on Thursday morning, Ms. Banerjee has already decided that her party will seek a discussion under Rule 168 — that allows for voting — in the RS on the same subject a notice has already been submitted, Trinamool sources said, adding the party was planning on moving an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha. The Trinamool clearly wishes to assume a leadership role, unfazed by the barbs being directed against it that its belligerence is a way of masking the Sarada-Narada scams in West Bengal. For Ms. Banerjee, who won a second term in the state earlier this year, would like the Opposition charge against the BJP in 2019.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led group is still assessing whether Prime Minister Modi’s appeal is working or not before it raises the pitch further.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Opposition-divided-over-strategy/article16643925.ece,New Delhi

Taking part in a seminar on demonetisation organised by the A.P. Editors Association here on Wednesday, they wanted the Centre to take more logical steps to eliminate counterfeit notes and weed out black money.
Initiating the discussion, A.P. Editors Association State president Krishnam Raju Vaadapalli said the government should order an independent probe to ascertain who had benefited by the spike in deposits of some banks in July-September quarter.
They suggested, among other things, enactment of a piece of legislation to confiscate ill-gotten wealth stashed in foreign banks, unearthing of benami land holdings and raids on safe deposit lockers of high networth individuals to unearth unaccounted wealth and drastic reduction in income tax rates to reduce generation of black money.

‘Increase IT limit’

Given the quantum jump in the cost of living, annual income below Rs. 10 lakh should not be taxed.
More and more people would voluntarily come forward to pay income tax if the rate was only 10 per cent on income from Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh, 20 per cent on income from Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 30 lakh. Income above Rs. 30 lakh could be taxed at 30 per cent, they suggested.

The demonstration, led by DCC president Venugopal Reddy here on Wednesday, sought to highlight the inconvenience caused to the general public, particularly the vendors, small traders and other members of the working class, who are unable to exchange high denomination notes for buying regular livelihood items and continuing their normal trade.
“Their [small traders/vendors] business have been dull since the announcement, with not many customers purchasing the products owing to the high value notes and lack of subsequent currency for exchange. How can the government justify their act if the working class, who depend on their daily business, are the worst affected?” he questioned. Terming the current demonetisation as a ‘move which was not well thought out’ [by the Central government], the activists alleged Prime Minster Narendra Modi has been supporting industrialists like Ambanis, Adani etc., at the cost of the common man. They later unveiled a flex banner highlighting the same message pictorially with a tagline - ‘Nalla Kuberulaki Pattam Kattina PM’.

2016-11-17 13:10:00,,"A day after he described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s November 8 decision to withdraw 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation as a “bold move”, billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates said on Thursday he had “no opinion” on the issue.
In a NITI Aayog lecture on Wednesday, Mr. Gates described Mr. Modi’s decision as an “important step” to move away from a “shadow economy to an even more transparent economy”.
To a specific question from The Hindu on Thursday at a select media roundtable on whether he supported demonetisation, Mr. Gates stated that he had “no opinion” on the issue.
Mr. Gates, however, predicted that India would go digital very rapidly and pointed to the process in countries like Kenya, where his foundation had worked. Government payments alone justified the digital path in India, he stressed.
When a reporter pointed out that India was a cash dependent economy, Mr. Gates responded: “That’s true”. He also felt that the Aadhaar, or India’s identity card system, was a “fantastic thing”.
In his Wednesday lecture, Mr. Gates said digital transactions would rise dramatically in India. “I think in the next several years India will become the most digitised economy. Not just by size but percentage as well.”
Mr. Gates was of the view that Aadhaar had not been attempted anywhere in the world, including in rich countries. “But now you have something that is going to underlie all your digital systems, whether it’s banking, tax payments, tracking healthcare records.”
On the reported decline in healthcare spending by the government, Mr. Gates said the spending had been flat. Advocating an increase in healthcare spending, he said in the end this was a political question and he wasn’t a voter in India.",,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Now-Gates-has-%E2%80%98no-opinion%E2%80%99-on-demonetisation/article16462003.ece,NEW DELHI

SUCI district secretary H.V. Diwakar said that the government should have taken steps to ensure that farmers, common citizens and small businessmen were not affected by this transition.

2016-11-17 00:00:00,Demonetisation eats into Nanjangud temple’s revenue,"There has been a decline in the revenue of the Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud after the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 last week.
According to Jayaprakash, executive officer of the temple, the revenue of the temple has reduced by over 35 per cent on an average.
There has also been a 40 per cent decline in the number of devotees visiting the temple, Mr. Jayaprakash said.
Mr. Jayaprakash told The Hindu that the average income of the temple is about Rs. 1.25 crore per month, which includes the sale of special entrance tickets, archana tickets and other religious rituals performed at the temple.
“Devotees are producing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes for different sevas. The temple authorities have no other option but to refuse the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The temple authorities are asking the devotees to give small denomination notes as religious institutions are not permitted to accept the banned notes,” Mr. Jayaprakash said.
As a result, people who can afford to buy tickets for special entrance or special pooja stand in long queues for the darshan and this has resulted in the temple losing a major chunk of its income, Mr. Jayaprakash said.
Over 3,500 to 4,000 people normally visit the temple on Sundays, Mondays and other auspicious days and at least 2,000 people visit the temple on other days on an average, he said. “Even dakshine to the arathi thatte has come down drastically,” he said.
He said that the temple authorities were not aware of people putting bags of the now banned Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes into the temple hundis. However, he said that he will soon appeal to the Deputy Commissioner of the district to open the hundis in the last week of November.
Similarly, there has been a sharp decline in the income and the number of visitors to the Chamundeshwari temple here.


Revenue of temple has reduced by over 35 p.c. and the number of devotees has declined by 40 p.c.

2016-11-17 01:14:00,TASMAC loses Rs 100 crore to demonetisation ," TASMAC has lost revenue of about Rs. 100 crore, post demonetisation. From November 9 to 13, the cash cow of Tamil Nadu on an average lost Rs. 15 crore per day. On November 14 and 15, the loss was pegged at Rs. 11 crore per day.
TASMAC sells liquor worth Rs. 67-70 crore per day through its 6,195 outlets across the State. On weekends, the sales shoot up to Rs. 90 crore. During the festive season, particularly Deepavali, Christmas and New Year, sales touches Rs. 100 crore on a single day.
TASMAC Managing Director Kirlosh Kumar could not be reached for his comments. Another senior official in TASMAC, said, “Tipplers stayed away from TASMAC counters since the demonetisation announcement. We had given instructions to our managers and salesmen not to accept Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000.” 
A senior union member said, “There was a lull for the first three days. People panicked about spending whatever cash they had with them,” he said, adding that on the fourth and fifth days people had Rs 2,000 notes, but there was no change at the counter to pay them back, and therefore they refused to take the notes.
A manager at one of the TASMAC outlets in Chennai, said, “Some units had good business because they accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, despite the orders. Some outlets managed to deposit the old currency at their banks.”
A total of 13 managers and supervisors with whom The Hindu spoke to in Chennai, unanimously said that demonetisation was the main reason for the dip in sales, but there was another reason for the revenue loss as well —short supply of liquor in the State.
Beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor from United Breweries, which holds 30 per cent market share in the liquor market have gone out of shelves. The company’s brands have not been available in the market from October 1.
In the Tiruchi region, liquor sales dropped by about 35-40 per cent. At one outlet near Central Bus stand in Tiruchi, which sells liquor worth Rs 2.7 lakh per day, sales was only to the tune of Rs 1 lakh after the Centre’s announcement. On Wednesday, the same shop registered sales of Rs. 2.5 lakh, restoring trade, according to a source.
Coimbatore, which sells liquor worth Rs. 3.5 crore usually, saw a steep fall in business. A TASMAC official in Coimbatore said, “Business at TASMAC Elite shops has also dropped slightly.” Officials said that over the last three days, the situation had stabilised and it was business as usual. Similar was the trend in Pollachi belt. In the neighbouring Nilgiris district, the tourist footfall dwindled post demonetisation which in turn has a cascading affect on liquor sales. 
Sales dropped by 25 per cent in the Salem region where TASMAC has 258 outlets. TASMAC sales in this pocket on an average stood at Rs 3.75 crore. On November 9, it tumbled to Rs 3.06 crore. Again, over the last two days, sales have picked up, and on November 15, it stood at Rs. 3.30 crore.
Liquor sale in the state has been growing at 12-15 per cent, year on year. More than 70 lakh people, consume liquor at TASMAC outlets everyday.

2016-11-17 01:09:00,‘Demonetisation will hurt food production’ ,": Reacting to the demonetisation-triggered crisis for the first time, the Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday said that disbursement of crop loans to farmers through primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and it would severely affect food production in the State. 
The government was “unable” to give new loans to farmers for samba cultivation which accounts for a major chunk of the State’s food production, an official release stated, adding that a meeting to discuss the situation was chaired by Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju in the Secretariat on Wednesday.
Crop loans have been given only to the tune of Rs. 2,075 crore as of November 7 this year, as against the annual target of Rs. 6,000 crore, it said, adding the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) announcement “not only disturbed the efforts to meet the target in terms of crop loans disbursement but would also affect the food production in Tamil Nadu”. 
As most of the farmers in rural areas had accounts in primary agricultural co-operative credit societies, payment of loans and collection of dues were severely affected as Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes could not be deposited here unlike branches of the nationalised banks, the government noted.
Though the State government ensured that fixed deposits in credit societies increased from Rs. 26,247 crore in 2011 to Rs. 54,914 crore this year, new deposits could not be made due to demonetisation.
Supply of fertilisers and seeds in all the 4,474 primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and other services like issuance of birth and death certificates have been severely affected leading to loss of revenue. 
The banking services of 23 district central co-operative banks and their 813 branches, which cater to several lakh customers, were also severely affected. Farmers were also not able to repay their loans, it added.

2016-11-17 19:20:00,Demonetisation disrupts rural and agrarian economy in Gujarat,"The demonetisation of high value currency notes has apparently led to considerable disruption in rural and agrarian economy where cash-based dealings are a norm. A week after the announcement of the removal of existing currency notes of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500, farmers and agriculture labourers are struggling on the streets to get cash to lead their day to day lives.
Majority of agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs) are shut as hardly any trading is taking place because farmers have produce but have no buyers. Except perishable items like fruits and vegetables, no trading is happening for grains, groundnut and cottons in any place across Gujarat where there are 207 APMC.
""There is no trading in any APMC except perishable items like fruit and vegetables. There is no clarity also regarding when the trading will begin,"" said an officer bearer of Junagadh APMC. According to him, farmers don’t have money to even buy seeds or fertilizers and pay to labourers as new sowing season has begun.
On Wednesday, the Gujarat government announced that the farmers can buy fertilizers from the dealers and depo of Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizer and Chemicals (GNFC) and Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals (GSFC) and also IFFCO.
""The issue is farmers are not used to deal in cash as less than five per cent farmers use cheque for making or receiving payments,"" said Veljibhai Patel, a farmer from Viramgam town near Ahmedabad.
""The rural economy has completely collapsed due to demonetization and also liquidity crunch. I want to sell cotton but there is no buyer in the APMC of cotton mill,"" said former Congress parliamentarian Virji Thummar, who is also chairman of Gujarat Congress Farmers cell.
The Gujarat government has requested the central government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow the district cooperative banks to accept deposit and exchange of old notes which has been prohibited by the RBI fearing large scale money laundering.
In Gujarat, there are 18 district cooperative banks which have more than 1000 branches catering to millions of farmers.
According to a senior leader of the ruling party BJP in Gujarat, if the situation does not improve by next week, there will be many issues. ""So far, despite problems, public has cooperated but you cannot rule out problems if the situation persists for a few more days,"" he cautioned.",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Demonetisation-disrupts-rural-and-agrarian-economy-in-Gujarat/article16644637.ece,AHMEDABAD
2016-11-17 00:00:00,Labour-intensive industries feel pinch of demonetisation,"Labour-intensive industries in Thoothukudi district have been affected by demonetisation of high-value currency notes, as they are not able to pay wages to their workers.
The traditional safety match industry, though largely mechanised, relied on labourers, J. Devadoss, secretary, South India Match Manufacturers’ Association, Kovilpatti told The Hindu on Wednesday. Around one lakh workers had been relying on this industry. Wages would normally be paid once a week based on productivity. The cash withdrawal allowed after demonetisation was inadequate to pay wages to labourers.
The cash withdrawal had been limited to Rs. 24,000 for a week for savings account holders and Rs.50,000 for current account holders. The ceiling should be increased to facilitate payment of salaries to employees. Presently, the labourers had been managing their day-to-day expenses with Deepavali bonus and last month’s salary, Mr. Devadoss said.
Moreover, traders from North India were reluctant to place orders for match boxes as they were used to cash transactions. Movement of finished goods to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha had come to a halt in the last one week, he said.
Salt industry had also been facing a setback as stocks of manufactured salt could not be transported. According to A.R.A.S. Dhanabalan, secretary, Thoothukudi Small-Scale Salt Manufacturers’ Association, salt production was stopped with the onset of monsoon in October-end. Normally, there would a demand for salt during rainy season, but not this year, he said. Despite achieving high production this year, the product could not be marketed because of demonetisation.
M.S.P. Thenraj, president, Thoothukudi Salt Traders’ Association, said there was a slowdown in the trade as employers could not pay wages to labourers engaged in packing and loading.
Since lorry drivers and attendants could not be paid, only 20-30 per cent trucks were being operated, that too on short routes, S. Varadharajan, secretary, Tuticorin District Container Truck Owners’ Association, said. Though truck operators had been exempted from paying toll until November 18 and demonetised notes were valid till November 24, the lorry crew needed money to buy food.

Getting change dificult

The Rs. 2,000 notes could not be given to them as they would find it difficult to get change. Had the authorities released new Rs. 500 notes earlier, this crisis could have been better managed, he said. Many ice plant owners were also feeling the pinch as suspension of mechanised boat fishing operations had forced them to stop production.

2016-11-17 18:10:00,Demonetisation should be used to reform election financing,"
Prabhat Singh

Any serious attempt at curbing the scourge of black money in India must involve reforming election financing, which has rightly been termed the >root of corruption. In the absence of state-funding of elections, most parties and candidates support electioneering through massive amounts of black money in cash, amassed through donations from corporates and rich donors. Post-elections, the winning candidates and parties unduly favour their donors.
In wake of demonetisation, the PM urged discussions on state-funding of elections. So far, parties have successfully resisted all such attempts. However, demonetisation has enfeebled them by hitting their black money finances hard. This presents the PM with the best chance to institute state-funding of elections, and thus carry out one of the most significant anti-corruption reforms in the history of independent India.


How bad is the problem?


Estimates say nearly $5billion was pumped into 2014 Lok Sabha elections, most of which was black money. Such gargantuan sums of money, coupled with the fact that there is visible involvement of some corporates in the campaign, gives an >appearance of corruption.
State-funding is a staple of election financing in countries with the fairest elections. In India, the void is filled by illicit corporate donations, resulting in quid pro quo post-elections.
A dysfunctional system of election financing is also major cause of criminalisation of Indian politics – in the absence of state support, funds must be managed from somewhere, and more muscle usually ensures more money.


An overview of the existing rot


Before one gets to ways of correcting the morass, it’s essential to have an overview of the system of election financing in India.
The system is two-tiered – based on parties and candidates. The parties are required to disclose income but not expenditure, while it’s the other way round for candidates.
The parties, whose main source of income comes from donations by individuals and corporations, use loopholes in the law to avoid disclosing identities of even the big individual donors. As regards corporate donations, despite the availability of tax breaks, most of it is done off-the-books mainly to avoid reprisals in case the opposing party wins. On the other hand, the candidates grossly underreport expenditure while actually spending far higher than the legal limits allow. Most of the illegal spending by candidates comes from the assistance given to them by their parties which carry greater financial heft, and have no ceiling on expenditure.


A new model


Before state-funding can be instituted to reduce the pernicious influence of black money on elections, two questions need to be answered:
1. How will finances be distributed amongst the various parties, and between a party and its candidates?
2. How will the Indian political parties, devoid of intra-party democracy, make judicious use of the money and select the right candidates?
Various committees in the past have tried dealing with the above questions, but have come up short. Usually the committees have recommended making vote share of previous elections the criteria for fund distribution. However, this would be grossly unfair to new parties as well as to the non-incumbents in case there’s an anti-incumbency wave. It might also induce complacency in parties with a high vote share. Other committees have remained non-committal about state funding due to lack of intra-party democracy.


Answering the questions


The answer to the two questions lies in the “matching funds” model that provides state funding based on collection of small-sum grassroots donations, which is being successfully implemented in New York, Netherlands, Germany, and several other geographies. Such a model would provide state funds to both candidates and parties based on the amount they collect from citizens, as long as contributions can be verified to be authentic. Those with greater public support, denoted by the greater funds they collect, will be entitled to more state funds. This will have to be done in steps so that funds from one round can be used to raise more in the next round. At the end of each round of fund-raising, expenditure >receipts for the total amount (donations+matching grant) would have to be furnished. If some money is unutilised, it would have to be returned, barring which the candidate would face severe penalties. This would minimise wastage of public money and encourage people to donate. The money for each candidate and party would have to be deposited in a separate account to allow Election Commission oversight.
To weed out fake/perfunctory candidates and parties, a floor (minimum limit) on the number of donors as well as the total amount raised, must be set. Similarly, a ceiling (maximum limit) on the amount of each donation would reduce the influence of rich donors. The exact parameters will have to be arrived at through wide-ranging consultations.
Matching grants would also ensure accountability of parties and candidates to their electorate throughout, because only that would make people part with their money when elections approach.
Without the need for legislation, giving matching funds to candidates would boost intra-party democracy by empowering those that have grassroots appeal. This would also help decriminalise politics. At the same time, matching funds to parties would ensure balance of power between them and their candidates. Higher funds can be allotted to parties that promote intraparty democracy and women candidates.
To ensure day-to-day activities of parties between elections can run smoothly without the need for black money, the ratio of matching grants can be higher for them than for the candidates. Calculations can be done based on existing estimates, keeping in mind that the ratio should not be so high as to allow excess funds to parties that could be rerouted to candidates, which would draw candidates away from grassroots donations. Alternatively or in addition, parties can be allowed to get matching grants for funds raised between elections too. If this happens, the ratio of matching grants for parties can be moderated. Funds given for non-electioneering purposes would have to be maintained in a separate account.
This model would help scale up what AAP employed to fund Delhi elections. In the absence of matching grants, it’s unlikely that grassroots donations alone will raise enough resources to compete on a multi-state/national scale. To scale up AAP’s model, matching grants are a must.
Since the tradition of fund-raising is nascent in India, awareness drives must be complemented by tax breaks and other incentives to encourage common citizens to donate. Given that grassroots donations might be limited initially, the ratio of matching grants would have to be higher than 1 (it’s 6 in NYC). This would ensure parties and candidates are sufficiently empowered to contest and also avoid the easier path of receiving illicit funds from corporates. The ratio can be reduced for donations above a threshold to prevent wastage of public money on already rich candidates. To encourage women candidates, the ratio of matching funds for them can be raised. By reducing governmental dependence on corporate money, state-funding would also incentivize deregulation of economy, since a regulated economy ensures corporates are beholden to the government.


Difficulties


This model, however, is not devoid of implementation >issues. Firstly, since each contribution must be verifiable, cash donations won’t qualify for matching grants unless accompanied by authentic receipts. This means that a lot of donors, who can’t donate through verifiable means (cheque/card etc.) are ruled out too. However, as things like universal financial inclusion, Aadhar and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) become reality, the EC and government should embark on massive awareness drives to encourage everyone to donate through verifiable means. Secondly, candidates might try to >reroute their black money through donations. However, given extant robust verification systems, this shouldn’t be a huge problem. Thirdly, verifying a large number of donations and making sure candidates and parties receive funds in time to smoothly run their campaign would raise administrative barriers, but in no way should be a deal-breaker.


Limiting expenditure


Acknowledging the fact that expenditure ceilings on candidates are almost always violated, they should be removed. Instead, in order to quell temptation to receive black money for electioneering, avenues for expenditure – ads, rallies – should be restricted, as they’re in countries like Germany, where elections are a rather staid affair.

2016-11-17 18:04:00,Demonetisation should be used to reform election financing,"Prabhat Singh
Any serious attempt at curbing the scourge of black money in India must involve reforming election financing, which has rightly been termed the root of corruption. In the absence of state-funding of elections, most parties and candidates support electioneering through massive amounts of black money in cash, amassed through donations from corporates and rich donors. Post-elections, the winning candidates and parties unduly favour their donors.
In wake of demonetisation, the PM urged discussions on state-funding of elections. So far, parties have successfully resisted all such attempts. However, demonetisation has enfeebled them by hitting their black money finances hard. This presents the PM with the best chance to institute state-funding of elections, and thus carry out one of the most significant anti-corruption reforms in the history of independent India.
How bad is the problem?
Estimates say nearly $5billion was pumped into 2014 Lok Sabha elections, most of which was black money. Such gargantuan sums of money, coupled with the fact that there is visible involvement of some corporates in the campaign, gives an appearance of corruption.
State-funding is a staple of election financing in countries with the fairest elections. In India, the void is filled by illicit corporate donations, resulting in quid pro quo post-elections.
A dysfunctional system of election financing is also major cause of criminalisation of Indian politics – in the absence of state support, funds must be managed from somewhere, and more muscle usually ensures more money.
An overview of the existing rot
Before one gets to ways of correcting the morass, it’s essential to have an overview of the system of election financing in India. 
The system is two-tiered – based on parties and candidates. The parties are required to disclose income but not expenditure, while it’s the other way round for candidates.
The parties, whose main source of income comes from donations by individuals and corporations, use loopholes in the law to avoid disclosing identities of even the big individual donors. As regards corporate donations, despite the availability of tax breaks, most of it is done off-the-books mainly to avoid reprisals in case the opposing party wins. On the other hand, the candidates grossly underreport expenditure while actually spending far higher than the legal limits allow. Most of the illegal spending by candidates comes from the assistance given to them by their parties which carry greater financial heft, and have no ceiling on expenditure.
A new model
Before state-funding can be instituted to reduce the pernicious influence of black money on elections, two questions need to be answered: 
1. How will finances be distributed amongst the various parties, and between a party and its candidates? 
2. How will the Indian political parties, devoid of intra-party democracy, make judicious use of the money and select the right candidates? 
Various committees in the past have tried dealing with the above questions, but have come up short. Usually the committees have recommended making vote share of previous elections the criteria for fund distribution. However, this would be grossly unfair to new parties as well as to the non-incumbents in case there’s an anti-incumbency wave. It might also induce complacency in parties with a high vote share. Other committees have remained non-committal about state funding due to lack of intra-party democracy.
Answering the questions
The answer to the two questions lies in the “matching funds” model that provides state funding based on collection of small-sum grassroots donations, which is being successfully implemented in New York, Netherlands, Germany, and several other geographies. Such a model would provide state funds to both candidates and parties based on the amount they collect from citizens, as long as contributions can be verified to be authentic. Those with greater public support, denoted by the greater funds they collect, will be entitled to more state funds. This will have to be done in steps so that funds from one round can be used to raise more in the next round. At the end of each round of fund-raising, expenditure receipts for the total amount (donations+matching grant) would have to be furnished. If some money is unutilised, it would have to be returned, barring which the candidate would face severe penalties. This would minimise wastage of public money and encourage people to donate. The money for each candidate and party would have to be deposited in a separate account to allow Election Commission oversight.
To weed out fake/perfunctory candidates and parties, a floor (minimum limit) on the number of donors as well as the total amount raised, must be set. Similarly, a ceiling (maximum limit) on the amount of each donation would reduce the influence of rich donors. The exact parameters will have to be arrived at through wide-ranging consultations.
Matching grants would also ensure accountability of parties and candidates to their electorate throughout, because only that would make people part with their money when elections approach.
Without the need for legislation, giving matching funds to candidates would boost intra-party democracy by empowering those that have grassroots appeal. This would also help decriminalise politics. At the same time, matching funds to parties would ensure balance of power between them and their candidates. Higher funds can be allotted to parties that promote intraparty democracy and women candidates.
To ensure day-to-day activities of parties between elections can run smoothly without the need for black money, the ratio of matching grants can be higher for them than for the candidates. Calculations can be done based on existing estimates, keeping in mind that the ratio should not be so high as to allow excess funds to parties that could be rerouted to candidates, which would draw candidates away from grassroots donations. Alternatively or in addition, parties can be allowed to get matching grants for funds raised between elections too. If this happens, the ratio of matching grants for parties can be moderated. Funds given for non-electioneering purposes would have to be maintained in a separate account.
This model would help scale up what AAP employed to fund Delhi elections. In the absence of matching grants, it’s unlikely that grassroots donations alone will raise enough resources to compete on a multi-state/national scale. To scale up AAP’s model, matching grants are a must.
Since the tradition of fund-raising is nascent in India, awareness drives must be complemented by tax breaks and other incentives to encourage common citizens to donate. Given that grassroots donations might be limited initially, the ratio of matching grants would have to be higher than 1 (it’s 6 in NYC). This would ensure parties and candidates are sufficiently empowered to contest and also avoid the easier path of receiving illicit funds from corporates. The ratio can be reduced for donations above a threshold to prevent wastage of public money on already rich candidates. To encourage women candidates, the ratio of matching funds for them can be raised. By reducing governmental dependence on corporate money, state-funding would also incentivize deregulation of economy, since a regulated economy ensures corporates are beholden to the government. 
Difficulties
This model, however, is not devoid of implementation issues. Firstly, since each contribution must be verifiable, cash donations won’t qualify for matching grants unless accompanied by authentic receipts. This means that a lot of donors, who can’t donate through verifiable means (cheque/card etc.) are ruled out too. However, as things like universal financial inclusion, Aadhar and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) become reality, the EC and government should embark on massive awareness drives to encourage everyone to donate through verifiable means. Secondly, candidates might try to reroute their black money through donations. However, given extant robust verification systems, this shouldn’t be a huge problem. Thirdly, verifying a large number of donations and making sure candidates and parties receive funds in time to smoothly run their campaign would raise administrative barriers, but in no way should be a deal-breaker.
Limiting expenditure
Acknowledging the fact that expenditure ceilings on candidates are almost always violated, they should be removed. Instead, in order to quell temptation to receive black money for electioneering, avenues for expenditure – ads, rallies – should be restricted, as they’re in countries like Germany, where elections are a rather staid affair. Restricting mega rallies by party leaders and ads with their faces plastered all over them would also help restore the accountability of candidates, and reduce the increasingly presidential nature of Indian elections. In addition, campaign cycle should be shortened.

2016-11-17 00:00:00,Demonetisation rocks Chhattisgarh Assembly,"The Central government’s move to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes rocked the Chhattisgarh Assembly on the first day of its winter session on Tuesday, with the main Opposition party, the Congress, forcing five adjournments during the day.
The Congress raised the issue of a suicide by a farmer in Raigarh district of the State, allegedly due to frustration caused by the demonetisation.
Led by the State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel, the Congress MLAs demanded discussion under an adjournment motion on the “panicky situation.”
“Sixteen people have died across the country and one farmer has committed suicide in Chhattisgarh because of this move. People are not able to use their own hard-earned money,” said Mr. Baghel on the day when the Raman Singh government planned to “congratulate” the Narendra Modi government on its move.
Speaker Gourishankar Agrawal, however, refused permission to the Opposition after which the Congress MLAs resorted to sloganeering and forced five adjournments.
Janata Congress MLA Amit Jogi, along with Congress MLAs Siyaram Kaushik and R.K. Rai, trooped to the well of the House in protest against the demonetisation.
The three MLAs were suspended from the House for protesting in the well of the House.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Amit Jogi came to the Assembly in a bullock cart to protest the “anti-poor” policies of the Raman Singh government.
There were heated exchanges between the Opposition and the Treasury benches throughout the day and hardly any business could be transacted as the Congress did not even allow the question hour.
The House was adjourned for the day after the government allowed the Opposition to participate in the discussion “to congratulate” the Central government on Wednesday on its demonetisation decision.
“There cannot be any discussion in the Assembly on a decision taken by the Central government. We can only congratulate them,” the Chief Minister said outside the House.",Delhi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Demonetisation-rocks-Chhattisgarh-Assembly/article16644185.ece,RAIPUR
2016-11-17 14:22:00,"Mamata, Kejriwal give Centre three days to roll back demonetisation scheme","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee along with her Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to demonetise Rs.500 and Rs.1000 currency notes.
Addressing a rally at Azadpur Mandi in Delhi, Mamata Banerjee gave an ultimatum to Centre to withdraw the scheme in three days reasoning that demonetisation will take the country backward by 100 years. ""The crisis of this proportion was not seen even during the Emergency,"" she said.
Taking a jibe at Mr. Modi, she said people are talking about plastic economy just because they have travelled few countries. ""What do they know about economy? People are dying here and they say it is a surgical strike on black money,"" she said. She added that the PM should stand in line with people to understand their pain. She also clarified that she is against black money but doesn't agree with the methods adopted by the Centre.
Joining her on the stage, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal launched a blistering attack against the Centre. He said that demonetisation is the biggest scam of Independent India. ""People will deposit Rs.10 lakh crore and Modiji will waive off loans amounting to Rs.8 lakh crore given to his corporate friends,"" he claimed.
Till date, around 40 people have died while standing in queues. ""Is this patriotism according to Mr. Modiji? Who is responsible for the death of these people?"" he asked.
Talking about the situation of traders in the city, he said that Azadpur Mandi was one of the busiest wholesale market with shops stocked with fruits and vegetable. ""But ever since the demonetisation scheme was announced, it is seeing a downfall and now it wears a deserted look. There is no circulation money in the market,"" he reasoned.
After the rally both, Mr. Kejriwal and Ms. Banerjee, went to meet the RBI Governor to discuss the “ill-effects of demonetisation“.",Delhi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Mamata-Kejriwal-give-Centre-three-days-to-roll-back-demonetisation-scheme/article16462077.ece,
2016-11-17 00:00:00,"With demonetisation, TASMAC loses Rs. 100 cr. in revenues","TASMAC has lost revenue of about Rs. 100 crore, post demonetisation. From November 9 to 13, the cash cow of Tamil Nadu on an average lost Rs. 15 crore per day. On November 14 and 15, the loss was pegged at Rs. 11 crore per day.
TASMAC sells liquor worth Rs. 67-70 crore per day through its 6,195 outlets across the State. On weekends, the sales shoot up to Rs. 90 crore. During the festive season, particularly Deepavali, Christmas and New Year, sales touches Rs. 100 crore on a single day.
A senior official in TASMAC, said, “Tipplers stayed away from TASMAC counters since the demonetisation announcement. We had given instructions to our managers and salesmen not to accept Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000.”
A senior union member said, “There was a lull for the first three days. People panicked about spending whatever cash they had with them,” he said, adding that on the fourth and fifth days people had Rs 2,000 notes, but there was no change at the counter to pay them back, and therefore they refused to take the notes.
A total of 13 managers and supervisors with whom The Hindu spoke to in Chennai, unanimously said that demonetisation was the main reason for the dip in sales, but there was another reason for the revenue loss as well —short supply of liquor in the State. Beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor from United Breweries, which holds 30 per cent market share in the liquor market have gone out of shelves.
In the Tiruchi region, liquor sales dropped by about 35-40 per cent. At one outlet near Central Bus stand in Tiruchi, which sells liquor worth Rs 2.7 lakh per day, sales was only to the tune of Rs 1 lakh after the Centre’s announcement. On Wednesday, the same shop registered sales of Rs. 2.5 lakh, restoring trade, according to a source.
Coimbatore, which sells liquor worth Rs. 3.5 crore usually, saw a steep fall in business. A TASMAC official in Coimbatore said, “Business at TASMAC Elite shops has also dropped slightly.” In the neighbouring Nilgiris district, the tourist footfall dwindled post demonetisation which in turn has a cascading affect on liquor sales.
Sales dropped by 25 per cent in the Salem region where TASMAC has 258 outlets. TASMAC sales in this pocket on an average stood at Rs 3.75 crore. On November 9, it tumbled to Rs 3.06 crore. Again, over the last two days, sales have picked up, and on November 15, it stood at Rs. 3.30 crore.

2016-11-17 00:00:00,TN sees demonetisation shadow over food output,"Reacting to the demonetisation-triggered crisis for the first time, the Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday said that disbursement of crop loans to farmers through primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and it would severely affect food production in the State.
The government was “unable” to give new loans to farmers for samba cultivation which accounts for a major chunk of the State’s food production, an official release stated, adding that a meeting to discuss the situation was chaired by Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju in the Secretariat on Wednesday.
Crop loans have been given only to the tune of Rs. 2,075 crore as of November 7 this year, as against the annual target of Rs. 6,000 crore, it said, adding the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) announcement “not only disturbed the efforts to meet the target in terms of crop loans disbursement but would also affect the food production in Tamil Nadu”.
As most of the farmers in rural areas had accounts in primary agricultural co-operative credit societies, payment of loans and collection of dues were severely affected as Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes could not be deposited here unlike branches of the nationalised banks, the government noted.
Though the State government ensured that fixed deposits in credit societies increased from Rs. 26,247 crore in 2011 to Rs. 54,914 crore this year, new deposits could not be made due to demonetisation.
Supply of fertilisers and seeds in all the 4,474 primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and other services like issuance of birth and death certificates have been severely affected leading to loss of revenue.
The banking services of 23 district central co-operative banks and their 813 branches, which cater to several lakh customers, were also severely affected.

Then came the three-swami pagoda, so called because it bore the image of Vishnu with two consorts. The mint that produced these also made lesser coins, all with names that are still familiar to us — fanam (36 to the pagoda), kasu/cash (80 per fanam) and duddu (10 of these made a cash).

The Nawab’s treasury accepted payments only if made in another variety — the Arni pagoda.
Besides this mint, there were also what were known as Country Mints, located at Poonamallee, San Thome, Covelong (Kovalam), Pulicat, Arni, Aalamparai, Thiruvallur and elsewhere.

2016-11-18 22:56:00,‘Demonetisation could halve GDP growth to 3.5% in current fiscal’,"The shortage of cash due to demonetisation could result in a drastic slowdown in GDP growth for 2016-17 to 3.5 per cent from an earlier projection of 6.8 per cent, according to an Ambit Capital report.
The report predicted that the second half of this financial year will see a GDP growth of only 0.5 per cent, down from the 6.4 per cent forecast by Ambit in the first half of the year. Official estimates for the first quarter of the year pegged the GDP growth at 7.1 per cent, the slowest in six quarters. 
However, the government has been optimistic of clocking higher growth in 2016-17 than the 7.6 per cent recorded in 2015-16. “(One effect of demonetisation) will be the transactional hit created by a hard cash deficit as banks are unable to replace the demonetised cash expeditiously,” the report’s authors wrote, noting that this is bound to have a paralysing effect on economic activity in the short run.
The report predicts that GDP growth in 2017-18 will also be affected by demonetisation, slowing to 5.8 per cent from an earlier estimate of 7.3 per cent.
Ambit also said that demonetisation could result in small businesses in the informal sector becoming unviable. It added that the effect on the real estate sector could also be severe based on its estimate that 30-40 per cent of the value of purchases take place using black money. 
“(The third effect) is likely to be a structural boost to tax-paying businesses in the formal sector which are able to capture the market share vacated by the informal sector,” according to the report. 
There could also be a detrimental effect on the Sensex, Ambit said, adding that it had scrapped its March 2017 Sensex target of 29,500 and was instead predicting a target of 29,000 for March 2018. One positive effect of demonetisation could be on interest rates.

In a statement here, B. Vinod Kumar, Lok Sabha Deputy Floor Leader of the Telugu Rashtra Samiti, said that on Thursday Mr. Rao had a telephonic conversation with Mr. Modi.
A statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office quoted Mr. Rao as saying that while he welcomed demonetisation ‘if it helped clean up the country’s economy’, the Centre should take into account the loss incurred by State governments and decreased flow of revenue to them.
Telangana wants the Centre to defer payments by States on the loans borrowed by them as they are hard-pressed for payments of advances and salaries to employees.
However, Mr. Rao’s counterpart in Andhra Pradesh, N. Chandrababu Naidu, had been a vocal supporter of the Modi government’s decision. 
Mr. Rao had said that all those having more than Rs. 2.5 lakh as income or savings should not be treated as black money holders. “It should be referred as unaccounted money. Small and medium traders, businessmen and those in the unorganised sector should be given exemptions. They should be given one more chance to disclose their income and deposit the money in banks, granting them one-time amnesty.”

2016-11-18 18:39:00,Demonetisation continues to stall Parliament ,"
Parliament was stalled for the second consecutive day on Friday due to ruckus by the Opposition parties, which were demanding in Lok Sabha a debate on monetisation under a rule that entails voting and presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Rajya Sabha for resumption of discussion on the issue.
 No business could be transacted in either the Upper House or the Lower House due to the pandemonium.
In the Lok Sabha, the Congress and some other Opposition parties pressed for a discussion on demonetisation under a rule which entails voting, that too through an Adjournment Motion which means suspension of all business.
Several notices were given by various Opposition leaders for discussion under the Adjournment Motion but Speaker Sumitra Mahajan rejected these, saying a debate could take place otherwise.
Ruckus started soon after the House met for the day, with Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanding that the issue of scrapping of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes be discussed through an adjournment motion and not the rule being proposed by the government.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the government was willing to discuss the issue and there was no need to press for an adjournment motion.
As the din continued, the House was adjourned for nearly one hour till noon, minutes after it assembled.
When the House assembled again for Zero Hour, the Opposition again pressed for moving an adjournment motion. But the Speaker rejected all the notices. Both Mr. Kharge and Trinamool leader Sudip Bandopadhyay insisted that the debate be taken up through an adjournment motion.
The Parliamentary Affairs Minister once again urged the Opposition to take up the debate under Rule 193 which does not entail voting and a formal motion.
Mr. Kumar said the Opposition should not “run away” from a debate and maintained that it was up to the Chair to decide under which rule the discussion will take place.
As part of their Zero Hour references, Meenakshi Lekhi and Gajendra Singh Chauhan (both BJP) raised the issue of remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Thursday linking deaths due to demonetisation crisis to the killings in the Uri terror attack. The remarks were expunged on Thursday night itself.
The two BJP members slammed Mr. Azad for the statement and demanded that a resolution be passed against him and he should be asked to apologise in writing.
As differences persisted and the Opposition continued to raise slogans like Pradhan Mantri sadan mein aao and Vijay Mallya kahan gaya, the House was adjourned for the day.
In the Rajya Sabha where a debate took place on demonetisation for six hours on Wednesday, the discussion could not resume even on Friday as the Congress and some other Opposition parties insisted on presence of the Prime Minister.
The House also saw a clash between the Congress and the BJP members as the ruling side raked up Mr. Azad’s controversial comments and demanded apology from the Congress. 
Slogans and counter-slogans in the Upper House forced its adjournment, first till 11.30 a.m., then till noon, then till 12.33 p.m., after that till 2.30 p.m. and finally for the day.
Soon after listed papers were laid on the table of the House, BJP members moved into aisles shouting slogans and demanding an apology from Mr. Azad for his remarks.
Congress members too rushed into the Well raising slogans demanding presence of the Prime Minister and an apology from him as well as the government for the hardship caused to the common man due to withdrawal of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation.
The AIADMK members were also in the Well raising slogans over the Cauvery water issue.
Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien asked all members to leave the Well and return to their seats, assuring them that he would hear their submissions.
Amid the din, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi alleged that Mr. Azad’s statement had given a message to the country that the Congress was sympathetic to terrorism and asked why it was so agitated when the demonetisation drive was only to hurt black money hoarders.
Mr. Kurien persuaded the AIADMK and the Congress members to withdraw from the Well, telling them that he would give opportunity to their leaders to raise their respective issues.
But with BJP members continuing to stand in the aisles and raising slogans, the Congress members too were back in the Well, shouting slogans.
Mr. Kurien said Treasury benches should not create problems for the Chair. “If you do this, what do I do? You should cooperate with me in running the House. Treasury benches should not disrupt,” he said.
But the din continued, forcing him to adjourn the proceedings till 11.30 a.m.
There was no change in the scenario when the House reassembled as both the BJP and the Congress members again started raising slogans.
While the Congress members trooped into the Well, several AIADMK members were seen standing at their places.
As the slogans and counter-slogans continued, the Chair adjourned the House till noon.
After repeated adjournments, when the House met again at 2.30 p.m., Opposition members continued to create ruckus.
Congress leader Anand Sharma accused the government of not wanting the House to run and for “destroying the poor” with his policies.
In the melee, the Deputy Chairman asked the MPs to introduce the Private Member’s Bill amid continuous sloganeering by the opposition and treasury benches.
Prior to this, he read out a decision by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on a private member’s bill for special package to Andhra Pradesh after its reorganisation, moved in the last session Congress member K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao.
The Bill was referred to the Speaker to ascertain whether it was a money bill and whether it can be introduced in the Upper House. However, Mr. Kurien’s statement could not be heard in the din.
Independent MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar moved his Bill to declare any country as state sponsor of terrorism and withdraw economic and trade relations with such country and to create legal, economic and travel sanctions for citizens of that country.
Following continuous uproarious scenes, Mr. Kurien adjourned the House till Monday. ",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-continues-to-stall-Parliament/article16642176.ece,New Delhi

2016-11-18 01:14:00,," The Opposition and the government clashed over the demonetisation issue on Thursday, bringing both Houses to a halt. The Lok Sabha functioned only for question hour amid a steady uproar, adjourning for the day well before 1 p.m.
The Rajya Sabha, meanwhile, was repeatedly adjourned, as the Congress-led Opposition mounted a sharp and relentless attack on the government. This was in sharp contrast to the peaceful discussion on Wednesday. 
In the Upper House, the Opposition made it clear it was not satisfied merely with responses from Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, even as remarks made by Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad about the Uri terror attack in the context of demonetisation forced the final adjournment for the day. 
The Lok Sabha witnessed continuous disruptions before being adjourned for the day, with Speaker Sumitra Mahajan turning down the Opposition’s demand for an adjournment motion on the issue.
As soon as the proceedings started, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanded that the Chair accept the adjournment motion but Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar said the government was ready only for a debate under Rule 193. 
Neither side yielded, and the Congress and other Opposition MPs continued to shout slogans.
Ms. Mahajan then said Opposition MPs did not seem to want a discussion, and only sought to disrupt the House. Eventually, the House was adjourned till 12.30 p.m.
When the Lok Sabha reassembled, Mr. Kharge again raised the demand for an adjournment motion. 
Ms. Mahajan simply said, “I have disallowed the adjournment.” The uproar continued unabated, and the Speaker adjourned the House for the day.
In the Rajya Sabha that witnessed a six-hour-long debate on demonetisation on Wednesday, the Opposition had pressed for the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the House and a response from him. 
On Thursday, as the discussion continued, the Rajya Sabha was repeatedly adjourned as Opposition MPs rushed into the well. ",,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-issue-brings-Parliament-to-a-halt/article16526717.ece,New Delhi

The 60-year-old small businessman from Birbhum district of Bengal has even tried to argue that he is disabled and need not stand in queues. 
“Even on Wednesday, I went to an ATM, but by the time I reached the machine, the cash was exhausted,” Mr. Sheikh said.
Earlier this week, a public interest litigation [PIL] petition by seven persons with serious disabilities was filed in the Calcutta High Court seeking a modification in the Central Gazette notification of November 8 announcing the demonetisation.
Counsel Akbar Ali said the notification should be changed allowing “authorised representative” of a person with disability to exchange currency. ",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Disabled-seek-PIL-route-over-demonetisation/article16526612.ece,Kolkata

2016-11-18 01:08:00,"Now, Gates has ‘no opinion’ on demonetisation "," A day after he described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s November 8 decision to withdraw 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation as a “bold move”, billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates said on Thursday he had “no opinion” on the issue. 
In a NITI Aayog lecture on Wednesday, Mr. Gates described Mr. Modi’s decision as an “important step” to move away from a “shadow economy to an even more transparent economy”. 
To a specific question from The Hindu on Thursday at a select media roundtable on whether he supported demonetisation, Mr. Gates stated that he had “no opinion” on the issue. 
Mr. Gates, however, predicted that India would go digital very rapidly and pointed to the process in countries like Kenya, where his foundation had worked. Government payments alone justified the digital path in India, he stressed. When a reporter pointed out that India was a cash dependent economy, Mr. Gates responded: “That’s true”.
 He also felt that the Aadhaar, or India’s identity card system, was a “fantastic thing”. 
In his Wednesday lecture, Mr. Gates said digital transactions would rise dramatically in India. “I think in the next several years India will become the most digitised economy. Not just by size but percentage as well.” 
Mr. Gates was of the view that Aadhaar had not been attempted anywhere in the world, including in rich countries. “But now you have something that is going to underlie all your digital systems, whether it’s banking, tax payments, tracking healthcare records.” 
On the reported decline in healthcare spending by the government, Mr. Gates said the spending had been flat. 
Advocating an increase in healthcare spending, he said in the end this was a political question and he was not a voter in India.

Naveen Kumar M., director of the firm, told The Hindu that many candidates, who had completed training, had not paid the fee amount. After the announcement by the Union government to withdraw Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination notes last Tuesday, at Enet Informatics, the demonetised notes were accepted as fee from the candidates who had enrolled for the courses on earlier date. A major chunk of students, who had turned defaulters have cleared their fee by making payment in Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes.

The kind of rush witnessed till Wednesday in banks for the exchange of the banned high-value notes was not seen since the last two days. Since November 10, a majority of people had exchanged the banned notes with banks which had extended their working hours to facilitate transactions of those standing in long queues. A senior bank official claimed that indelible ink applied on the fingers on those coming to exchange the cash cannot be cited as the sole reason for the drop in the number of people coming to the banks for cash exchanges. 
Meanwhile, banks have received instructions to disburse Rs. 2.5 lakh to each family for marriage expenses on producing proof such as wedding card to the banks. When contacted, Mysuru Lead Bank Manager K.N. Shivalingaiah confirmed to The Hindu about the new guideline and added that banks have been told to provide the cash as fixed by the Centre to the account holders upon production of proof of wedding.
Families preparing for weddings had expressed their concern over difficulties in accessing cash for meeting the expenses in view of the ceiling following demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The Ministry of Economic Affairs had relaxed the norms for weddings enhancing the withdrawal limit to each family at Rs. 2.50 lakh.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Rush-to-exchange-demonetised-notes-drops-moderately-in-Mysuru-banks/article16644734.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-18 00:23:00,Will demonetisation turn farmers into defaulters?," With the Union government barring all credit cooperative societies from accepting demonetised Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes, lakhs of farmers who have taken crop loans and other loans are facing the danger of being termed defaulters and paying penal interest of 14 per cent.
The Reserve Bank of India has barred district central cooperative banks which have thousands of credit cooperative societies attached to them from accepting the demonetised notes, a move which has been criticised strongly by many cooperative leaders and farmers.
While the immediate impact of the decision is that the societies have become cash-starved because of non availability of cash with farmers, the worst affected among the farmers will be those who have neared the deadline for repaying their crop loans.
“Farmers have taken annual crop loans ranging from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 3 lakh. If they do not return them in 365 days, they will lose interest incentive and will be termed defaulters. Most of them want to repay loans in old currency, but we are helpless,” chairman of the Bidar District Central Cooperative Bank Umakanth Nagamarapalli said.
Karnataka Central Cooperative Bank of Dharwad, which has 550 credit cooperative societies with 1.5 lakh farmers under it, has already felt the pinch. “Even a day’s delay will make them defaulters and they have to pay 14 per cent interest. The RBI has said nothing about it in its directions,” said the bank’s chairman I.S. Patil. “We have to function as per the RBI guidelines. This is a blow to cooperative societies that take care of farmers,” Mr. Patil said.
Honorary president of the Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha Chamarasa Malipatil demanded that farmers who are nearing deadline should be allowed to repay the loan in old currency notes. “Otherwise, the penal interest should be waived,” he said.
Handling charges
Urban credit cooperative banks are being asked to give undertakings that they would pay “handling charges” for the old currency notes. The director of a noted urban cooperative bank in Hubballi said officials of the State Bank of India and Axis Bank asked them to give the undertaking. While one bank told them that they were “likely” to be asked to pay handling charges of Re. 1 for every Rs. 1,000 (in old currency), the other bank told it could be around Rs. 4 per Rs. 1,000. “For banks which are receiving deposits of around Rs. 1 crore it will come to Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 40,000 per day,” he said.
Bidar DCC bank in a fix
The Bidar District Central Cooperative Bank, the biggest lender in the district, is in a fix. It has collected Rs. 113 crore in the week after the demonetisation, but nationalised banks are refusing to accept this pile of cash as the Union government has barred all cooperative societies from accepting demonetised notes. 
“The collections — exchanged noted and deposits — from November 9 have totalled to Rs. 113 crore. But no nationalised bank is accepting it. What do we do now?’’ asked Umakanth Nagamarapalli, BDCC bank chairman. He said over 70 per cent of farmers in the district were getting crop loans from their societies or village branches. “Our problem is compounded as we are supposed to pay a 4 per cent interest on money thus collected. If the government does not accept this as legal deposit, how can we pay interest to depositors?” he said. 
The bank, which is a federation of 45 branches and 171 primary agriculture cooperative societies, has nearly 4.91 lakh deposit accounts and 2.23 loan accounts. It has 3.75 lakh SHG accounts. The bank also maintains heavy duty accounts like those of the five sugar factories in the district.
He also complained that currency chests in nationalised banks were releasing only around Rs. 20 lakh a day to the bank. “This means that we can not transact less than Rs. 1 lakh per branch per day,” he said.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Will-demonetisation-turn-farmers-into-defaulters/article16520265.ece,HUBBALLI/BIDAR

2016-11-18 00:00:00,Demonetisation drive helps MCC mop up revenue,"The Centre’s demonetisation move may have caused inconvenience to people, but has given the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) reasons to smile. The municipal and local bodies being allowed to accept the scrapped Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes for payment of taxes and utility charges is helping the cash-strapped MCC fill its coffers.
The collection of property tax and water bills by MCC has been continuing at a brisk pace after the government extended the last date for accepting old notes till November 24.
The MCC, which collected Rs. 3.17 crore as property tax and water bill due from November 9 to 15, crossed the Rs. 4-crore mark on November 16. “We collected more than Rs. 4 crore in six days, starting November 9, excluding Saturday and Sunday,” MCC Commissioner G. Jagadeesha told The Hindu .
To capitalise on the extension of last date for accepting old notes, the MCC is using multimedia communications to reach out to property owners and water consumers to clear dues. The MCC has directed their nine zonal offices to dispatch vehicles fitted with public address system to announce acceptance of the old notes for payment of dues. “We will continue this drive till November 24,” Mr. Jagadeesha added.
Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Kumar Naik said MCC has tied up with Kotak Mahindra bank, which has set up kiosks in the zonal offices, to help the public pay their dues. “While MCC personnel at the kiosk will assist in filling out the challan, the bank representatives will collect the cash,” Mr. Naik said.
While the property tax collection target for 2016-17 is Rs. 200 crore, Mr. Jagadeesha said the MCC had so far collected Rs. 73 crore. The carried over balance of property tax due from previous years amounting to Rs. 50 crore, had been included in the target amount.
The MCC had managed to collect about Rs. 28 crore against the target Rs. 33 crore as water dues for 2016-17, he said. However, a balance of Rs. 100 crore from the previous years is still due, he added.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Demonetisation-drive-helps-MCC-mop-up-revenue/article16667121.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-18 00:00:00,Agri co-op. bank staff flay demonetisation,"Condemning the Centre’s demonetisation policy, members of Tamil Nadu Primary Agricultural Cooperative Bank All Employees Association staged a demonstration on the premises of the Collectorate here on Thursday.
Nelson Devapichai, district president of the association, who led the agitation, said the Centre had demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, but the people were unable to get fresh currencies.
Farmers were also affected as in the wake of the demonetisation exercise Primary Agricultural Cooperative Banks (PACBs) remained almost paralysed. Only when fresh currencies became available the operations would be resumed in the PACBs.
Poor farmers had been relying on the PACBs and cooperative credit societies for their monetary needs, but now they were forced to go to towns to withdraw money.
The PACBs also could not cater to the needs of the farmers, the protesters said.
Moreover, the farmers were unable to insure their crops and the women self-help group members were unable to repay loans. The public also faced hardship as they could not withdraw cash deposits and jewels pledged in cooperative societies as 154 of primary agricultural cooperative credit societies had been remaining closed for the last eight days, they alleged.
In Tirunelveli, members of the association, led by its State general secretary K. Muthu Pandian, staged a demonstration near Palayamkottai market. As many as 160 primary agricultural cooperative credit societies across Tirunelveli district remained closed.

Nagercoil

Urging the government to implement a seven-point charter of demands, the members of Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Cooperative Employees Association, who gathered in front of the Collectorate in Nagercoil, alleged that thousands of farmers were in a fix as they could not close their crop and jewel loans before due dates, as Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) were not authorised to receive the invalidated currencies.
The demonetisation exercise had also made farmers lose the interest subsidy from the government, said P. Victor Doss, vice- president of the association.
Kanniyakumari District Central Cooperative Bank (KDCCB) should replace the invalidated currencies from the PACCS and allow the societies to withdraw funds from Savings Bank accounts.
The farmers and PACCS members were unable to redeem pledged jewels due to the cap on weekly withdrawal from banks. The farmers should be allowed to redeem their jewels based on the proof submitted by them, he urged.
Association president S. Sahaya Thilakraj presided. KDCCB president Sampath Chandra and association office-bearers participated.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Agri-co-op.-bank-staff-flay-demonetisation/article16667322.ece,Thoothukudi
2016-11-18 00:46:00,Trust in the time of demonetisation," Many years ago, a man called Francis Fukuyama proposed an economic theory that rested on trust. He argued that economic development would be based on the amount of trust each society displayed in non-kin relationships. 
In his 1996 publication, Trust, he said: “One of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nation’s well being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.” 
This past week, we’ve probably come out with flying colours in a Fukuyama test. Since demonetisation reduced liquidity in the market, with limited sectors accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes as legal tender, and the insufficiency of notes to replace the currency, this society has moved on, largely thanks to trust. At a micro level, people, traders, vendors who are used to cash transactions on a daily basis, sought refuge in credit and trust, hoping the tide would turn again.
For auto rickshaw drivers, water can suppliers, milkmen, tea shops, small roadside eateries with their loyal clientele, it was easy to slip into credit mode.
Vanessa Peter, who often takes auto rickshaws to commute to work, found it was exactly this which came to her rescue when she hailed an auto at the stand near her house in Kodambakkam, after the demonetisation drive left her short of change.
“The driver knows me well and I have taken his auto several times. I told him I did not have the money to pay for my ride that day and he readily agreed to take the money whenever I could pay him.” She later paid the fare two days later. She’s been lucky though. The vendor who supplies drinking water at her home also left behind three cans, though she could only pay for one at that time.
Some altruism is part of the business
It is not all profit for Samivelu, a water bubble-top supplier in Madipakkam. He said all his customers had promptly made payments all these days, and he felt that water being an essential commodity, it was his duty to ensure they got the water, even if he had to supply it all on credit.
For more than half his life, 45-year-old jeweller S.Raman of Perambur has been travelling all over Chennai selling inexpensive, costume jewellery made from beads and metal to homemakers and working women. Mr. Raman, called ‘manikaarar’ had to make adjustments after November 8. A client purchased jewels worth Rs. 6,500 but asked if he could wait until the first week of December for payment. “Don’t worry about it. I have earned your trust over the years and I need nothing more,” he replied.
In Coimbatore, several builders have requested the grocery outlets and tea stalls near their construction sites to give products on credit to their workers.
With a shortage in the availability of cash to pay weekly wages for the workers, they have only paid an advance amount to these workers. Dhanalakshmi, who has rented out two houses to workers, says her tenants were unable to pay the rent. “How can I ask them when they have not received their wages properly? I know they will pay up when they get money,” she says.
Owners of rice mandis, medical shops, local kirana stores and even water suppliers in Chennai knowing well the cap and difficulties in withdrawing cash are not pressuring their customers to pay immediately.
S. Anuradha, a resident of Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, was apprehensive about what to do when she ran out of rice. She was pleasantly surprised when the owner of a rice mandi nearby offered to give her stocks, which she could pay for with a cheque.
Retail and wholesale in the same boat
At Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity. “Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions,” said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association.
“Retail traders who purchase onions from us say they will pay after selling the produce. We realise their position and allow them to take the stocks on credit. We know we may have to wait for even up to a month to get the money,” he said. The same with suppliers. “While we are able to pay our suppliers from other states through bank transfers, we have to withhold cash payments to local farmers who supply us small onions,” he said. Most farmers accept this, but some have stopped bringing the produce to the market.
J. Madhavan, who runs a stationery shop in Madurai, said the daily sale of school and college notebooks and accounts books used to be around Rs. 25,000 a day but had plummeted to Rs. 2,000 a day since the announcement. Regular customers like representatives of educational institutions, who used to seek only discounts on notebooks, were now seeking credit for want of currency notes. He had no option but to oblige. 
Petty shopkeepers too say that sales on credit are on the rise. “We allow most of our regular customers to pay later and allow credit for new customers. In some cases, I do not even make a note of the purchase when the crowd is heavy. Most people do not cheat and pay up in a day or two. Besides, I often find there is no change to give back if a customer produces a Rs.100 note for one tea. I have to ask him to pay later,” said Kumar, who runs a tea stall in Thennur. 
Trust works both ways
There’s also trust from the other side. There are regular customers who pay up tea stalls and vegetable vendors larger notes and ask them to hold the change against future purchases. A bakery owner from Salem says he sells goods on credit only to known customers, and politely turns away others.
T. Arunkumar, an advocate at the Madras High Court, said stamp vendors from whom he regularly purchased stamp papers were now lending them on credit. “This is a great help. It is not that clients who approach us for registrations or for filing litigation are without money. They have cash but due to the demonetisation there are practical problems in converting the old currencies with the prevailing day and weekly limits in force.”
Particularly, for any kind of registrations involving a immovable property, be it a settlement, gift or a release deed, one would require a minimum of Rs. 20,000 value stamp papers. The alternative is to pay by a demand draft, but again it is a time consuming option given the rush in the banks to deposit and exchange old currencies. A vendor confirmed, “Yes, we do give them on credit but not for all. We can trust only those who are regularly doing business with us for years.”
But trust too, seems to have a threshold level. With the situation not improving in the last week, and liquidity going from bad to worse, traders and vendors have begun to fret. “To avoid embarrassment, provisions are sold on credit to select customers. By and large, we turn away buyers seeking credit purchase,” Jebastin Solomon, a grocery shop owner at K.K.Nagar, said, adding that it is simply impossible to conduct business without even a minimal cash flow for too long.
Clearly trust too is going to run out if liquidity does not improve. An addendum to Mr. Fukuyama’s theory will probably be written in this country.

2016-11-18 20:59:00,Seminar on demonetisation today," The Communist Party of India (ML-New Democracy) district committee will conduct a seminar on ‘Demonetisation of high-value currency notes, impact on common man’ at Recob Bazar School here on Saturday. 
In a statement here on Friday, the party district secretary G. Venkateshwara Rao said that common man continued to reel under the impact of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. 
The Government, which scrapped high-value currency notes in the name of curbing black money, owed an explanation to the nation on the rationale behind introduction of Rs. 2,000 currency notes, he said. 
Financial analyst D. Papa Rao, former professor of economics Kanaka Chary, the Communist Party of India (ML-New Democracy) Telangana State Assistant Secretary P. Ranga Rao and others will also address the seminar.

2016-11-18 23:31:00,,"The yarn bobbins mounted on the creel of the circular interlock machine move seamlessly. A series of bulky movements later, the off-white yarn churns out some more off-white cloth, stretched from under the cylinder of the knitting machine. Venkatachalam, in his mid-50s, stands watching his machines, with his hands crossed behind his back, in his unit in Samundipuram in Tiruppur.
The air is thick under the slow grumble of the machines and the steady suspension of off-white dust of the yarn, accentuated by the yellow light bulbs lighting up from underneath each running machine, casting long shifting shadows. Bales of yarn waiting to be fed into the machine and bales of cloth knitted from the yarn ready for the supplier are stacked on the side of the shop floor. This is what remains of the Diwali stock, he says.
Venkatachalam had reached the knitting unit at 6 a.m. to run the machines. “My first worker will come in at 8.15 a.m,” he says. Until last week, this unit of 16 machines ran with two workers on round-the-clock shift. They were paid Rs.3,000 each every Saturday.
This Monday, a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes invalid, Venkatachalam had cut down two shifts to one. This has meant only alternate days of work for each of the two labourers. “Now, I’ll pay Rs.1,500 each to the two workers this week. No fresh yarn has come, and even if it did, I can’t run the machines without cash,” he says. Last week he produced 600 kilogram of cloth, against the usual 1,500 kilogram per week. He receives cheques from the supplier. But his wages are in cash.
Some 18 kilometres away in Pandian Nagar, Shakthivel is picking up the last of the cloth bundles he had commissioned Karal Marx for cutting. Marx owns a rib-cutter that cuts fabrics into bundles of ribbons that are then stitched up as folding on collars and sleeves of T-shirts. His rib-cutter occupies a 50-sq.-feet space partitioned off his less-than-modest living quarters. The last of the bundles remaining from the Diwali stock supplied by people like Shakthivel are the ones left for work for Marx.
At the foot of the rib-cutter is a can full of petrol. “Oh that. I had to fill petrol for my moped. But they refused change and I was forced to buy petrol for the entire money,” says Marx.
Shakthivel runs a stitching section with seven labourers including his wife. The supplier provides him with cut cloth, and the cloth runs through five machines to emerge as a fancy top. “Just my type” declares a fair-skinned girl gazing out of a fuchsia printed top, on the bundle just finished.
Only two days ago, Shakthivel had asked three of his workers not to come. “I only have old cash. And no fresh orders had come, and there were serpentine queues in the bank.” He has to pay Rs.4,000 each to each of them. He plans to wind up the remaining work, and lock up the section for the rest of the week. The rent of Rs.6,000 for the stitching section and house rent of Rs.5,000, both due for the 10th, was not accepted with old cash. Bending down to gently pick up her two-year-old son asleep on a cut cloth on the floor, Shakthivel’s wife Swarnalatha asks him if they should go to Palani, to be with their relatives.
Abu Baquar Siddique, Shakthivel’s chief tailor, is a man of quiet pride. He collects part of his weekly wages daily, the Rs.200 from Shakthivel every evening goes into buying 2 kilograms of rice for Rs.100 and other groceries for a fresh-cooked dinner for his family of four. On Wednesday, Shakthivel gave him Rs.500 of the old note to tide over.
When the past week saw households running on credit, goodwill, trust and goodness of the local grocers, Siddique never kept an ‘account’ of credit with any grocer. “I never have before. That’ll push us to buy more, consume more.” So, when the outlet refused to accept his money, he simply migrated to PDS rice. But his two young boys are unable to eat the poor quality ration rice.
These men (and women) are part of the garment supply chain that swells at the lowest end to include many interdependent household units. This chain train hinged on work orders from the small supplier, to a micro unit, to the last-mile household unit — until demonetisation stopped it in its tracks. Slowly, units are beginning to grind to a halt, threatening to snap this chain.
Two domestic suppliers that supplied cloth to Shakthivel’s stitching section locked down this Monday. The same two suppliers had supplied cloth to 20 other units with workforce of 20 each. Between them, the two suppliers each had a workforce of 100-150 workers. “They have to pay me around Rs.20,000-Rs.30,000,” says Shakthivel.
Small suppliers and dependent tiny units that look to the supplier for work are wary of piling up work commitments and resultant unpaid wages.
On Wednesday, the South Indian Collar Shirt and Small Manufacturers Association (SISMA) passed a resolution to downscale from 15 shifts per worker per week to six shifts. “Units are already laying off non-salaried workers,” says K.S. Babuji, general secretary, SISMA.
Eashwaramoorthy is a domestic supplier selling to buyers in Mumbai and Delhi. His unit with a 20-man workforce has now pared down to just three workers. The rest were asked not to come. “The current account withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 is not allowed by banks here. How do we pay,” he asks.
Demonetisation for the garment industry came at a time when the buyers were on the verge of settling payments of the suppliers for the Diwali despatches across the country. The buyers are now unable to make bank transfers to the suppliers beyond Rs.49,000, and that too only after the suppliers courier multiple copies of proof for bank verification.
The garment industry in Tiruppur is made of three types of units: exporters, merchant exporters who receive subcontract work from exporters, and domestic suppliers.
Exports — a Rs.22,000-crore turnover business — are primarily cashless. Yet demonetisation has tangentially affected exporters because they have to engage peripherally with cash-based subcontracts for ‘job works’ such as knitting, buttoning, small servicing, printing, packing to merchant exporters. The merchant exporters themselves are small units with a workforce paid in cash.
The cash crunch has halted 25 per cent of subcontracts commissioned by exporters, says T.R. Vijaya Kumar, general secretary, Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA), that has over 1,000 members. The exporters will have to deal with penalty of 20 per cent additional costs on shipments that will now be airlifted.
It’s domestic suppliers who are facing the demonetisation heat the most. They include micro units and sections that are partly, largely or fully run on cash.
The garment industry in Tiruppur has 8 lakh employees; 4 lakh in direct employment and another 4 lakh in subsidiary units such as knitting, dyeing, printing, embroidering, spinning, accessories. Of this, 20 per cent or 1.6 lakh workers are estimated to be unorganised workforce. There are 2,000 small, medium and tiny units — now facing the prospect of phased lockout — that provide work to this unorganised workforce.
Early this year, the TEA had met the Prime Minister during his visit to Coimbatore to present a ‘Vision 2020’ document to him that envisages increasing the garment industry’s turnover to Rs.1 lakh crore by 2020. 
When demonetisation was announced, the exporters had cheered the decision. The TEA estimates the turnover of domestic units at Rs.7,000 crore from accounted transactions and another Rs.7,000 crore from cash transactions. On the other hand, the unorganised units solely run on cash are estimated to have a turnover of Rs.15,000 crore.
 For the exporters, this is a ‘parallel economy’ with a cumulative Rs.22,000-crore turnover. “This supply chain runs on cash, weeding out taxes. If this economy is integrated, then there will be a level playing field for all,” says Vijaya Kumar.
Jeganathan bears a distant look as he scans through a Tamil paper. He was making daily sales worth Rs.10,000-Rs.30,000 on average out of his 80-sq.-feet shop, stacked with bundles of trackpants, T-shirts of all hues. On Monday, he sent away the only daily wager he had. “Yesterday, I downed the shutter by 4 p.m.,” he says. Not a single sale on Wednesday in the shop he co-owns with his brother.
Khaderpettai market represents that parallel economy that Vijaya Kumar was talking about. It has over 3,000 shops, wholesale and retail and godowns, run solely on cash transactions. Khaderpettai lends the retail-end support for the domestic garment suppliers. They lend the rationale for business for the smaller manufacturing units, whose manufacturing orders hinge largely on the business vibrancy of Khaderpettai. Some of the garment godowns are straight extensions of the manufacturing units.
The hustle of Khaderpettai is missing since the demonetisation. Many believe things would look up once money circulation picked up.
The garment industry has a high labour demand. Attrition rate is 50 per cent, and the average labour shortage is 35 per cent. There is a general resistance both among labourers and domestic units to crediting wages through banks. Wage account entails Employees’ State Insurance and Provident Fund contribution from both ends. Labourers, with marginal wages, are not enthused at the prospect of deduction, and employers are equally unwilling to contribute.
 Demonetisation has struck at the heart of this cash mode of payment of wages. Hence, ever since demonetisation, a primarily contractual workforce is migrating from smaller domestic units to export units, which credit salary through wage accounts. But the ability of smaller export units to absorb this preliminary flight of labour will unfold only in the coming days. Also, export units may not fully be insulated as the chain involves cash-based merchant exporters too.
Exporters also view demonetisation as a prelude to the nationwide rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), as a move to bring everything into accounting, force small units to migrate to wage accounts. “Once GST comes into operation in April, there will less opposition and easy integration,” predicts Vijaya Kumar.
But on the ground, there is another reality being played out. The experience of micro units and sections so far indicate a possible immiserisation of owners and workers. 
While labourers just may have the option of flitting to an export unit wherever possible, marginal units such as Shaktivel’s stitching section or the yarn-knitting unit of Venkatachalam don’t have that option. At worst, they will have to close down and move into the labour market themselves.
Forty years ago, Vijaya Kumar’s father had started out with 10 workers and 10 machines. Today, he runs an export business with 1,500 workers. “If this had come then, my father would not have survived,” he agrees.
This churn will decimate small units, which are unable to migrate, have no means or know-how to systemise their business operations. This slowly would also mean that businesses can henceforth be run only by the educated, who can engage tax accountants, auditors, and dedicated personnel for documentation. “Today’s tiny units are tomorrow’s larger units. This will also mean nipping start-ups in the bud,” concedes Vijaya Kumar.
Pointing at three shuttered shops in a Khaderpettai lane, a man, who refuses to disclose his name, says that almost all shops have sent away their daily wage workers. Until last week, each shop had a Hindi-speaking worker to help negotiate with buyers from beyond the Vindhyas. 
“Do you see knitwear in the street shops of Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi? They are from here. The garment units are showroom; we, Khaderpettai, are for the pavement. The poor buy from us,” he says. “We all started off lifting loads on our back and have come to own businesses. We are not educated.”",,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/The-warp-and-woof-of-demonetisation/article16645634.ece,

The by-elections will be held in Cooch Behar and Tamluk Lok Sabha constituencies and in Monteswar Assembly constituency. Ruling Trinamool Congress, BJP, Left Front and Congress have fielded their candidates in all three seats.
Although the Congress and CPI(M)-led Left Front had contested the Assembly polls held earlier this year, the two decided to part company in this round of by-elections.
Demonetisation has become a key issue in the last lap of campaign for the bypolls. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did not campaign for the bypolls and left it to the other leaders of her party.
Apart from state BJP president Dilip Ghosh, Union minister Babul Supriyo canvassed for his party.

According CPI(M) and Congress leaders, demonetisation has all of a sudden come up as an issue for the polls as they are receiving feedback that people are inconvenienced due to the new decision.
CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said demonetisation became a prominent issue as the people faced huge problems and added that the situation was much worse in rural areas.
The BJP, on the other hand, said that by-elections would be a litmus test for political parties.
“What TMC, Congress and CPI(M) are saying is not right. People of Bengal are happy with the decision and will give a hands down victory to our candidates,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.
“It’s not a question of black money or white money. All of a sudden if you scrap high value notes how will you meet various expenditures for the campaign,” Congress candidate from Monteswar Bulbul Ahmed Sheikh said.
By-election in Cooch Behar was necessitated by the death of TMC MP Renuka Sinha while the by-election in Tamluk in East Medinipur district was caused by the resignation of TMC MP Suvendu Adhikari who also won the Assembly poll and joined the state cabinet as transport minister.

2016-11-18 00:00:00,Demonetised notes accepted at book fair,"To attract buyers during the cash crunch, book sellers at the eleventh Ganjam District Book Fair in Berhampur have decided to accept the demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.

Hit by demonetisation

It is one of the several book fairs organised in Berhampur, a major trading centre of Odisha, every year. This year the book fair started on November 14 and will go on till November 23. As the fair coincided with the sudden declaration of the Central government to demonetise high denomination currency notes, it has had a major impact on the sale of books.
A day after the fair’s inauguration, book sellers and the organizers of the book fair decided to accept the demonetised notes, said Bhabani Shankar Panigrahy, secretary of the book fair organising committee.
All sales will have receipts so the sellers can deposit the cash in old currency in their bank accounts.
Customers have welcomed this decision and sellers at the fair, like Dilip Kumar Sahu of ‘Lark Books’, said that they are doing transactions with the old notes daily. Poet and former member of Odisha Sahitya Akademi, Bipin Nayak said people should realise that investment of old currency to buy books is acquirement of something which will not lose its value with time. “People are searching outlets to encash their old notes, they should come over and buy some books with them to decrease their monetary burden,” he added.

Sales not high

However sellers feel people facing the cash crunch are not yet ready to spend their old currency notes for books.
Basant Kumar Panda, a book seller at the fair said sale of books has also not gone up much despite the move to accept old currency notes.

2016-11-18 19:40:00,ICAI members hail demonetisation,": The chartered accountants praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing demonetisation of high denomination currency notes to keep a check on unaccounted money.
At an awareness programme organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party, here on Friday, Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI) Karimnagar chapter chairman D. Niranjana Chary hailed the bold decision of the Union Government. 
He said the demonetisation would check terrorism and hoarding of unaccounted money.
Allaying fears among the people, he said that they would not face any problem in banking transactions with their legal money. 
He said that presenting the PAN card number was mandatory in the banking system if a customer withdraws more than Rs. 50,000. 
The institute office-bearers K. Venkateshwarlu, G. Anand Kumar, N. Varaprasad, Y. Anil Kumar, K. Rammohan, BJP official spokesperson Bandi Sanjay Kumar and others participated in the programme. They said that the demonetisation would help reduce prices in the real-estate sector and there would be no registrations of properties under fictitious names. It would also have an impact on the fee of management-quota seats in professional colleges.
They also said that people would be habituated to do more banking transactions and there would be more deposits in the banks helping the bankers in providing more loans at lower interest rates. 
They also clarified that the CAs would only tell the people on how to manage taxes and help the Government get its revenue.",Hyderabad,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ICAI-members-hail-demonetisation/article16642168.ece,KARIMNAGAR
2016-11-18 19:21:00,Demonetisation hits rural farmers hard ,"Kozhikode: In an attempt to overcome demonetisation challenges, rural merchants in the district are still depending on old currency notes as a last resort to pay farmers who are in need of liquid cash. 
While a few are trying to run the show by partly releasing money to their regulars, majority are still clueless about tiding over the challenge in the changing circumstances. Binu Abraham, a rural farmer, reveals that old currency notes are still in use in many locations as a short-term arrangement to manage the crisis with the mutual consent of sellers and buyers. 
“In emergency cases, farmers familiar with local traders accept old currency notes and get them exchanged at various banks later,” he adds. 
George Thottathil, a farmer from Koodaranhi, says: “There are around 10 shops in the Koodaranhi and Koombara regions alone, but none of them makes full payment to their clients owing to shortage of currency notes. Small-scale rubber growers are the worst hit even as their well-off counterparts somehow manage the crisis by granting more time to local traders to clear arrears.” 
Mr. George also points out that local agriculturists are facing a huge crisis owing to the closure of some rural shops as a result of the currency crisis. “We can’t blame merchants alone as they have been depending on the conventional style of trading with liquid cash for decades,” he adds. 
P. Saji, a rubber merchant from Thiruvambadi, says only a few farmers in his area know how to use credit and debit cards as they have been meeting daily expenses using liquid cash. “The sudden withdrawal of high-value currency notes has literally shaken them and doubled their turmoil,” he adds. 
K. Johnson, a farmer and office-bearer of a newly constituted farmer organisation at Koombara, points out that he is also among the several hundreds of frustrated settler farmers who are yet to get the money for the agriculture produce they have sold in the open market. “In the last two weeks, I sold 130 kg of raw rubber to a local merchant. I am yet to get the money as the trader complains of shortage of new currency notes,” he rues. 
The experience is not any different for coconut farmers. They say the continuing reluctance of small- and large-scale traders to take the stock for more than a week is ultimately fuelling the whole crisis with no easy way out. Owing to shortage of liquid cash for daily transactions, many are opting for the conventional credit purchase from familiar local shops that are yet to get into the modern style of trading involving swipe card machines and internet banking.

2016-11-18 00:00:00,M.P. by-polls first litmus test for BJP after demonetisation,"As campaigning ends on Thursday for the November 19 by-elections to the Shahdol Lok Sabha and Nepanagar Assembly seats, the ruling BJP will face its first litmus test since demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes.
Retaining both the ST seats in this by-polls will be crucial for the BJP as if it loses any one of them it will be construed that the decision to scrap high denomination currency has not gone down well with the people, a Congress leader said.
However, a BJP leader exuded confidence of retaining both the seats with a comfortable margin and claimed that the issue of demonetisation will not affect its poll prospects.
“People were facing grave problems with this dictatorial order. Both common man and farmers were forced to stand in long queues. Farmers are not having money to purchase fertilizers and seeds,” Madhya Pradesh Congress president Arun Yadav told PTI.
“People are highly annoyed with the decision and I am sure that they will vote against the BJP on the issue,” Mr. Yadav said.
They are already facing a lot of problems because of lack of development and tall claims of the government that people are getting 24x7 power supply in the State. Now, the decision to demonetise Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes has added further fuel to the fire, the Congress leader said.

Not an issue

However, BJP leader and Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd chairman Hitesh Bajpai said that demonetisation was not an issue in tribal-dominated areas.
“They are more concerned with issues of getting land lease rights, their staple food is rice and jowar and they are happy with it,” he said.
“(Earlier) the party had won the Shahdol seat with a margin of over two lakh votes and I am sure that we will retain it with a difference of more than 1.5 lakh ballots,” he said.

Public meetings

MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and State BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan, former Union Minister Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and State Congress president Arun Yadav have addressed series of public meetings to woo voters and drum up support for their respective parties.
Mr. Chouhan has frequented Shahdol to ensure that the BJP retains the seat. He is taking no chances given that the BJP had failed to retain the Ratlam-Jhabua Lok Sabha by-polls in November 2015. - PTI

2016-11-18 21:02:00,Demonetisation will not hit informal economy: BJP ,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Informal economy will not be crippled by demonetisation, and real productive economy in agriculture, tiny and micro enterprises will improve, BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao has said.
On the other hand, the highly extortionist practices of daily finance would be hit to some extent, he told reporters here on Friday.
Describing demonetisation as the beginning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war against black economy, fulfilling the 2014 election mandate, he said it would bring down inflation very soon and curb speculation in gold and land. Consequently, their rates would come down, bringing them within the reach of the common people.
Describing demonetisation as a historic step and not a decision in isolation, he said it would bring about fundamental changes in political and economic system, including simultaneous elections and State-funding of elections. The war also could later be taken to black money in the form of gold and land.
The war against black money would ultimately benefit the people and that was the reason why the Prime Minister appealed to the people to bear with the inconvenience for 50 days. 
He addressed the nation because he knew about the problems that would arise from demonetisation of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation. 
He said that the Rs.2,000 note was not a substitute for Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, and RBI had not indicated the volume of Rs.2,000 notes it would print. The demand for higher denomination notes could not be estimated and the government was seized of the matter.
Demonetisation would result in considerably higher revenues for State and Central governments, enabling them take up construction of schools, hospitals, etc., Mr. Rao said.
Mr. Modi had taken up the issue of bringing back black money stashed abroad, and because of limitations in international laws it could not be achieved, he said. 
The government, however, would not compromise on black money abroad. A SIT was constituted at the first Cabinet meeting. The mandate against black money was not divided, Mr. Rao said.

Its members distributed pamphlets accusing the Central government of carrying out a surgical strike against the common man to cover its failures on all fronts. The pamphlets claimed that the demonetisation would not help bring out the black money, which were stashed away in foreign countries and in various forms of investments in gold and real estate.
Black money hoarders would not be affected by the move, it claimed.
The organisation demanded why the common man should be made to suffer when they were not responsible for the rise in black money, fake currencies and corruption. Its members distributed the pamphlets to those standing in queues at banks in different parts of the city on Thursday.
“We are staging street plays in various places to create awareness among the people and asking them to resist the move,” said P.Dharmaraj, coordinator, Makkal Adigaram, Tiruchi.
The first phase of this campaign would continue till November 20, he said.

Protest in Pudukottai

Members of the district wing of the Tamil Nadu State Cooperative Bank All Employees’ Association staged a demonstration in front of the Collelctor’s Office here on Thursday to highlight their difficulties as transactions in cooperative societies and banks have come to a standstill following the demonetisation.
Led by T. Balasubramanian, district secretary of the association, they raised slogans urging the Centre to evolve ways and means for normal functioning of primary cooperative societies in rural areas.
M. Ramachandran, district president, said that secretaries could neither get old currencies from those who repaid loans nor make disbursements. “No transaction can be effected at these institutions, which form the grass-root of the banking system,” they said in a memorandum to the Collector, S. Ganesh.
Meanwhile, the serpentine queue in front of the branches of nationalised banks continued on Thursday. Indelible ink was applied on customers’ fingers. No sooner an automated teller machine was re-filled with cash, a large crowd of customers vied with one another in withdrawing the money leaving it dry within a few hours.",Tiruchirapalli,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/Campaign-against-demonetisation/article16667304.ece,TIRUCHI

2016-11-19 16:30:00,How this Mumbai koliwada is tiding over demonetisation,"Every day, this woman, possibly in her 60s, sits on a little durrie, a drugget, and sets up shop right next to the jetty. Ferries transport travellers — around 50 or 60 at a go — to and from Madh Island. It includes young star-crossed lovers, fisherfolk, families on Sunday outings, friends looking to get away. A ticket costs Rs. 3. The area is called Versova gaon. It’s a ‘koliwada’, a colony of fishermen, just outside Mumbai. Versova gaon, which hosts the annual Versova Koli Seafood Festival,is a few minutes from Yari Road, perennial home to younger Bollywood hotshots (like, say, Shahid Kapoor or, earlier, Priyanka Chopra) and also aspiring stars who’re known in Mumbai, both colloquially and condescendingly, as the “strugglers”. The jetty is packed with massive boats that aren’t in use anymore. A fisherman tells me casually that each boat costs Rs. 15 lakh or so (or 15,000 hundred-rupee notes). Within a year, it loses most of that value. The boats stationed here, he says, are now bhangaar, scrap.
The woman sells garlic. It’s garlic, but — oddly — you can’t smell it. That’s because the air is thick; smouldering with the whiff of fresh fish. It’s the kind of smell that moves upwards, from the nostrils into the space between the eyebrows before settling into your brain, where you can smell nothing else for the next few hours. During low tide, when all the fish wash ashore, it gets especially bad (or good — I’m no one to judge anyone’s olfactory preferences).
Before November 8, business used to be good, the garlic seller tells me. She’d make Rs. 800 a day, sometimes up to a thousand rupees. With that, she could keep her household running, and also buy some new stock to sell. She has three sons. She lost a son eight months ago to dengue. After November 8, she’s making less than half of that. Around Rs. 350 a day. Right now, she’s making just about enough to get by, but with no eye on the future. “People are burning thousand-rupee notes; they’re dumping them into the sea. No one’s giving us anything,” she says, with an odd note in her voice. It’s not anger, possibly resignation or dejection. Hope, though, remains. She’s hoping things will settle down in the next few days.

‘Feel the music and dance,’ says the poster at a dance studio called The Dance Floor, which is shut when I get there. Next to it is a departmental store aka supermarket aka kiraane ki dukaan. The man running it — teeth faded, hair grey, earring in one ear, dressed in a classic white shirt — is hunched over his desk, looking dreadfully bored. He points to a plastic jar that’s almost empty. It contains chocolates for Re. 1 each. These jars are such an inescapable part of growing up. You get hold of some loose change and you scamper off to the friendly uncle who runs one such store in literally every neighbourhood. You buy the latest candy that all the other kids are talking about. He can’t replenish the supply fast enough.
The owner, Dilip (name changed), talks about how demonetisation has affected the community around him. Business has been impacted considerably. No one is buying because no one has any cash. Which means his stocks aren’t getting over. If they do, he won’t have the cash to buy more. Down the line, his suppliers aren’t getting any goods. It’s a massive slowdown. Which means you sit and hope and wait. Grin and bear it. That’s what Dilip says. He’s not giving credit; no one in the area is, unless you share a good relationship with someone.
Just then, this little runt shows up in a red shirt and shorts and floppy hair. No more than two-and-a-half feet tall, he yells out ‘Uncle’ repeatedly. But Dilip can’t even spot him from behind the counter. So the kid hands me a two-rupee coin and points at something. The only word he knows, or is ready to say, is ‘uncle’. He refuses to accept the two candies he’s handed by Dilip, pointing instead at the Gems packet. Dilip tells him that the small Gems packet costs Rs. 5, so he should bring Rs. 3 more. Silence. “Run along,” says Dilip. The kid stands his ground. Within a minute or two, Dilip relents and hands the kid a Dairy Milk bar at a 60 per cent discount. “Khud hi dekh lo,” he says, “ab kya karein.” (You see? What can we do?)

Closer to the sea, there’s a little congregation happening under a shaded, half-enclosed area, sort of like a panchayat but more relaxed. There’s a man sitting on a makeshift bench. He owns the boats. He has a flowing silver beard, tied at the bottom with a red rubber band. Next to it is a small boat, on which a man sits weaving fishing nets. One net costs Rs. 300. Is anyone buying? Do you have change to return? “Ah, well,” he responds. It is what it is.
They’re all aware that business is slow. How do you pay for diesel in the boats? How do you buy the nets? Who’s going to pay for the fish? And in what denomination? Nevertheless, they’re trying to stay positive, hopeful that things will get better soon. They feel this will affect them for at least the next six months, although the immediate crisis should get over in the coming days. They’re telling themselves, and me, that it’s for the greater good. It’s not a lie; they do believe it’ll work out in the long run. But it’s also far more nuanced than that. There’s hope and resentment and cynicism and dejection and optimism all at the same time. They grin, then stop, then laugh, then stare quietly into the distance. One fisherman friend there rues the fact that their cause hasn’t really been taken up. “Humaara koi waaris nahi hai wahaan pe.” (We don’t have a voice.) His laugh sounds bitter.
The chaos after the demonetisation is being documented. Is it collateral damage? Do the ends justify it? These are legitimate queries, but walking through this urban fishing village, I suspend all questions. It seems to make more sense to keep my conversations with the people of Versova gaon to just their day-to-day life. I cannot pretend to understand their situation.
****
My new friends on the boat insist that I visit the fish market a couple of hundred metres away. While in school, we were accused of sounding like a fish-market every time we got too loud, so I go in expecting chaos. But things seem fairly calm. It’s around 4.00 p.m., so the freshest fish have already been sold. The four women I speak to are trying to get rid of the last batch of jhinga (prawns)in their bucket, and tell me the best time to buy is 2.00 p.m.
They go out to sea with their husbands, and come back to the market to sell the catch. They have to pay the boatmen who take them. The leader of the group tells me that they’ve struck up a weekly or monthly deal with these men, so that they don’t have to pay cash for each trip. It’s not credit, more like buying in bulk. An MBA graduate might have said “consignment buying”. The woman offers her last batch of jhinga for Rs. 250. I buy Rs. 100 worth of shrimp, some 40 tiny ones in a little black plastic bag, a little less than half of what’s in the bucket. “I was born in this village,” she says, “and I will die here.” She’s stoic in the face of adversity, maybe even proud, refusing to accept that the last 10 days have affected her. Her colleagues are willing to concede that it’s become quite hard; that everyone’s working extra hours to sell as much as they can. But not her. A young girl in her teens offers to clean the shrimp. I refuse awkwardly and walk away.
The mood, as far as I can gather, isn’t one of gloom or simmering rage. There’s barely any concern with the politics of the move. In fact, if anything, there’s empathy. The silver-bearded boat-owner tells me that someone like Rahul Gandhi didn’t need to stand in a queue but he still did. The Prime Minister’s 94-year-old mother didn’t need to exchange her notes, he says, but she still did. It’s all about making do and getting by. And this too shall pass.

Here’s a round-up of all the important developments:
1. On November 19, banks served only their respective customers and did  not exchange old notes from customers of other banks. However, the restriction was not applicable to senior citizens.
2. The Supreme Court on Friday warned that there “may be riots” and refused the government’s plea to stay cases filed against demonetisation in High Courts and lower courts across the country, saying “how can we shut our doors to people when there is a problem of such magnitude.”
3. The exchange limit has been reduced to Rs. 2,000 to ease some pressure on cash demand. Families can withdraw up to Rs. 2,50,000 for weddings.
4. The withdrawal limit from ATMs has been increased from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,500, but this will apply only to the recalibrated ATMs.
5. Several measures were announced to ease the burden on farmers. To ensure sowing in the Rabi season, the government has allowed farmers to withdraw Rs. 25,000 a week against crop loan/kisan credit card. Traders in agricultural mandis will be permitted to draw Rs. 50,000 in cash per week to pay for sundry expenses like wages. While the time limit for payment of crop loan insurance premium has been extended by 15 days, government employees up to Group C have been given an option to draw salary advance in cash.
6. To stop repeat money exchange with invalid currency notes, banks have started applying indelible ink mark on the right index finger of customers in select metro cities.
7. Following the move, the Election Commission asked the Central government to continue its use of indelible ink at banks, but in keeping with the EC’s directions.
8. The exemption deadline for all those services allowed to accept the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes was extended to November 24 midnight. These services include petrol pumps, pharmacies, and utility services amongst others.
9. Parliament saw repeated disruptions over the issue. Both Houses ended up being adjourned on the second day of the winter session after Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s remarks comparing deaths in this period to those in the Uri attacks. MoS for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi demanded an apology from Mr. Azad, stalling business further.

2016-11-19 00:00:00,Demonetisation effect: Jewellery trade scenario turns bleak,"Gandhi Road, Ongole’s main jewellery market, sees thin crowds nowadays in the wake of scrapping of high-value notes by the Centre.
The footfalls to gold shops has dropped to single digit from about 50 since the commencement of the marriage season since Diwali as a majority of sales are only through cash. Only some big corporate jewellery stores, which have come into existence of late in the city, still transact taking payments from customers either by way of cheque or plastic cards.
People with stocks of scrapped notes make enquiries, but refrain from making any purchases. Many smaller players who cater to the needs of rural people are completely out of business, say some leading gold shop owners here.
“We have been expecting a brisk sale for six months from now. But the demonetisation has put paid to our hopes,” laments Andhra Pradesh Gold Merchants Association state convener Thata Prasad in a conversation with The Hindu here. Only those with the dire need for purchasing gold for special occasions do so with either cheques or plastic cards, he explains. The silver lining for the jewellery industry is that people from now will feel safe putting their money on gold and precious stones than currency notes in the medium to long run, thanks to demonetisation.
“In the short run, the bullion market likely to see a correction,” he opines, adding that “our business has come to almost standstill as we have stopped accepting scrapped Rs.500 and Rs. 1,000 rupee notes from November 8.”
The jewellers had already lost business for three months following their protest against imposition of excise duty on gold and diamond jewellery by the Centre and making mandatory PAN card for purchases worth Rs.2 lakh, points out its Ongole unit vice-president V. Venkateswarlu.
At least 60 per cent of the jewellery shops here will have to down the shutters once and for all if the Centre does not ensure replacement of notes expeditiously as almost 97 per cent of the business is done with cash as the industry is unorganised, laments its treasurer P. Ramesh Kumar.
Expressing concern over the fall in business, Tata Goldplus branch manager Boyapati Naveen Chowdhary wants the Centre to enhance the credit limit for each day to up to Rs.5 lakh to enable customers purchase gold ornaments.
“No big sale could be clinched since November 9. Only some small purchases like studs, ear rings, nose studs are made,” he adds.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-effect-Jewellery-trade-scenario-turns-bleak/article16668115.ece,ONGOLE
2016-11-19 00:50:00,Farmers at Vijayapura AMPC Yard forced to accept demonetised notes," When Rudrappa Marigoudar, a farmer of Atharga village in Vijayapura district unloaded his onion bags at the APMC Yard here, little did not know that he would be forced to accept money which has now been demonetised.
“Everyone knows that Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denomination notes are no longer valid for transaction. But here dealers are forcing farmers to accept old notes or take back commodity. What is the choice before the farmers other than accepting old notes and later get them exchanged in banks. If we refuse to accept, we will have to bear expenses of carrying back the commodity which is perishable, and no farmer can afford to do that,” he said.
This is the situation most farmers, who bring perishable commodities such as onion or lemon to the APMC yard from their farms and are forced to accept demonetised currency, find themselves in.
The farmers said that agents give them a simple reason for giving them demonetised notes.
“They say that since agriculture income is exempted from tax, farmers can get any amount of old notes deposited and exchanged in banks. While the agents easily get their old notes disposed of, it is the farmers who have to bear the pain of waiting in queues at banks to deposit old notes,” the farmers said.
The agents, meanwhile, have their own reasons for using old notes.
One of the main onion dealers of the city, who did not wish to be identified, said that the dealers do not have adequate cash in Rs. 100 or Rs. 50 denomination.
“We have to make payments in lakhs to farmers. How do we arrange for so much money in Rs. 100 denomination. The farmers can get old notes easily exchanged but the same is not the case with us; thus, it is inevitable for us to pay in old notes,” he said.
Meanwhile, transactions have been badly affected in the APMC market which predominately deals in cash.
“The onion market alone has been witnessing a loss. While normal arrivals are over 2,000 bags daily, after the note ban, it has come down to 500 bags. The porters here who used to earn about Rs. 500 a day are also losing earnings,” the dealers said.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Farmers-at-Vijayapura-AMPC-Yard-forced-to-accept-demonetised-notes/article16654776.ece,Vijayapura
2016-11-19 00:59:00,,"Apprehending “riots,” the Supreme Court on Friday refused the government’s plea to stay cases filed against inconveniences caused by demonetisation in High Courts and lower courts across the country, saying, “How can we shut our doors to people when there is an issue of such magnitude.”
Noting that people have started becoming “frantic” for money, braving queues for hours, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur observed that the very fact that cases are being filed in courts all over is a signal that the problem is “serious and of magnitude.”
“They are going to the courts for relief. We cannot shut our doors to the people,” Chief Justice Thakur said, refusing the government’s plea.
The Bench, however, said the government could file transfer petitions to shift all the cases filed in other courts to Delhi.
“This is very serious. This will require great consideration. People have become frantic, people are affected... There may be riots,” the Bench, also comprising Justice Anil R. Dave, told Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi. “That is completely wrong. People are patiently standing in lines,” Mr. Rohatgi protested.
""There is suffering. There is difficulty and you cannot dispute that,"" Chief Justice Thakur observed.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal submitted that 47 people had died post November 8, as an after effect of the demonetisation.
""Would we be issuing notifications by the day, by the hour, if we were not concerned about the people's problems? The length of the lines is reducing by the day,"" Mr. Rohatgi claimed.
Chief Justice Thakur asked why the government has a problem in dispensing enough cash. ""Tell us, is there any deficiency in Rs. 100 notes? They have not been demonetised. Why are they not been made available at least?"" the Chief Justice asked.
The government acknowledged that there was a shortage of Rs.100 notes as the now defunct Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes had formed 80 per cent of the currency in circulation before November 8. “Rs. 100 notes are not available as Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes was over 80 per cent of the currency,” Mr. Rohatgi submitted.
But the Attorney-General, in the same breath, said denied any “cash crunch”. He submitted that there was only trouble dispatching the newly printed currency all over the country — to post offices, ATMs, banks, etc.
Chief Justice Thakur asked why the government chose to reduce the limit of exchange of currency notes from Rs. 4500 to Rs. 2000 despite the Supreme Court asking the Centre to do its best to alleviate the hardship of the common man.
Mr. Rohatgi replied that debit cards could be swiped for cash at petrol bunks. and a withdrawal limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh has been allowed for wedding purposes. Besides, farmers would get Rs. 50000.
Mr. Sibal said, “People with Mercedes can afford to swipe their cards at petrol bunks, not farmers. And many who line up are illiterate...A family walked 20 km from Bastar to an ICICI bank branch,” he said.
Mr. Sibal said 23 lakh crore notes have to be printed and Rs. 14 lakh crore worth currency was frozen as from November 8. 
Mr. Rohatgi at this point directed the government's attack on Mr. Sibal, accusing him of attempting politics in court. “I saw your press conference,” Mr. Rohatgi told Mr. Sibal.
“Was my press conference held in court? Then why are you bringing it here?” Mr. Sibal countered.
The Bench has asked both the Centre and Mr. Sibal to produce facts and figures on November 25, depicting the ground realities and sufferings caused to the people due to demonetisation. 
The apex court had on November 15 refused to stay the government’s demonetisation notification, but asked it to spell out the steps taken to minimise public inconvenience. Out of the four PILs in the apex court on the demonetisation issue, two were filed by Delhi-based lawyers Vivek Narayan Sharma and Sangam Lal Pandey, while two others were filed by individuals, S Muthukumar and Adil Alvi.
The petitioners have alleged that the sudden decision has created chaos and harassment to the public at large and the notification of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance be either quashed or deferred for some time.",,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/SC-fears-riots-says-people-are-frantic-due-to-demonetisation/article16654850.ece,NEW DELHI

2016-11-19 01:43:00,The warp and woof of demonetisation,"
Samundipuram, Wednesday, 7.30 a.m.

 The yarn bobbins mounted on the creel of the circular interlock machine move seamlessly. A series of bulky movements later, the off-white yarn churns out some more off-white cloth, stretched from under the cylinder of the knitting machine. Venkatachalam, in his mid-50s, stands watching his machines, with his hands crossed behind his back, in his unit in Samundipuram in Tiruppur.
The air is thick under the slow grumble of the machines and the steady suspension of off-white dust of the yarn, accentuated by the yellow light bulbs lighting up from underneath each running machine, casting long shifting shadows. Bales of yarn waiting to be fed into the machine and bales of cloth knitted from the yarn ready for the supplier are stacked on the side of the shop floor. This is what remains of the Diwali stock, he says.
Venkatachalam had reached the knitting unit at 6 a.m. to run the machines. “My first worker will come in at 8.15 a.m,” he says. Until last week, this unit of 16 machines ran with two workers on round-the-clock shift. They were paid Rs.3,000 each every Saturday.
This Monday, >a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes invalid, Venkatachalam had cut down two shifts to one. This has meant only alternate days of work for each of the two labourers. “Now, I’ll pay Rs.1,500 each to the two workers this week. No fresh yarn has come, and even if it did, I can’t run the machines without cash,” he says. Last week he produced 600 kilogram of cloth, against the usual 1,500 kilogram per week. He receives cheques from the supplier. But his wages are in cash.

Life in the slow lane

 Some 18 kilometres away in Pandian Nagar, Shakthivel is picking up the last of the cloth bundles he had commissioned Karal Marx for cutting. Marx owns a rib-cutter that cuts fabrics into bundles of ribbons that are then stitched up as folding on collars and sleeves of T-shirts. His rib-cutter occupies a 50-sq.-feet space partitioned off his less-than-modest living quarters. The last of the bundles remaining from the Diwali stock supplied by people like Shakthivel are the ones left for work for Marx.
At the foot of the rib-cutter is a can full of petrol. “Oh that. I had to fill petrol for my moped. But they refused change and I was forced to buy petrol for the entire money,” says Marx.
Shakthivel runs a stitching section with seven labourers including his wife. The supplier provides him with cut cloth, and the cloth runs through five machines to emerge as a fancy top. “Just my type” declares a fair-skinned girl gazing out of a fuchsia printed top, on the bundle just finished.
Only two days ago, Shakthivel had asked three of his workers not to come. “I only have old cash. And no fresh orders had come, and there were serpentine queues in the bank.” He has to pay Rs.4,000 each to each of them. He plans to wind up the remaining work, and lock up the section for the rest of the week. The rent of Rs.6,000 for the stitching section and house rent of Rs.5,000, both due for the 10th, was not accepted with old cash. Bending down to gently pick up her two-year-old son asleep on a cut cloth on the floor, Shakthivel’s wife Swarnalatha asks him if they should go to Palani, to be with their relatives.
Abu Baquar Siddique, Shakthivel’s chief tailor, is a man of quiet pride. He collects part of his weekly wages daily, the Rs.200 from Shakthivel every evening goes into buying 2 kilograms of rice for Rs.100 and other groceries for a fresh-cooked dinner for his family of four. On Wednesday, Shakthivel gave him Rs.500 of the old note to tide over.
When the past week saw households running on credit, goodwill, trust and goodness of the local grocers, Siddique never kept an ‘account’ of credit with any grocer. “I never have before. That’ll push us to buy more, consume more.” So, when the outlet refused to accept his money, he simply migrated to PDS rice. But his two young boys are unable to eat the poor quality ration rice.

Grinding to a halt

 These men (and women) are part of the garment supply chain that swells at the lowest end to include many interdependent household units. This chain train hinged on work orders from the small supplier, to a micro unit, to the last-mile household unit — until demonetisation stopped it in its tracks. Slowly, units are beginning to grind to a halt, threatening to snap this chain.
Two domestic suppliers that supplied cloth to Shakthivel’s stitching section locked down this Monday. The same two suppliers had supplied cloth to 20 other units with workforce of 20 each. Between them, the two suppliers each had a workforce of 100-150 workers. “They have to pay me around Rs.20,000-Rs.30,000,” says Shakthivel.
Small suppliers and dependent tiny units that look to the supplier for work are wary of piling up work commitments and resultant unpaid wages.
On Wednesday, the South Indian Collar Shirt and Small Manufacturers Association (SISMA) passed a resolution to downscale from 15 shifts per worker per week to six shifts. “Units are already laying off non-salaried workers,” says K.S. Babuji, general secretary, SISMA.
Eashwaramoorthy is a domestic supplier selling to buyers in Mumbai and Delhi. His unit with a 20-man workforce has now pared down to just three workers. The rest were asked not to come. “The current account withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 is not allowed by banks here. How do we pay,” he asks.
Demonetisation for the garment industry came at a time when the buyers were on the verge of settling payments of the suppliers for the Diwali despatches across the country. The buyers are now unable to make bank transfers to the suppliers beyond Rs.49,000, and that too only after the suppliers courier multiple copies of proof for bank verification.

Tiruppur’s layered system

 The garment industry in Tiruppur is made of three types of units: exporters, merchant exporters who receive subcontract work from exporters, and domestic suppliers.
Exports — a Rs.22,000-crore turnover business — are primarily cashless. Yet demonetisation has tangentially affected exporters because they have to engage peripherally with cash-based subcontracts for ‘job works’ such as knitting, buttoning, small servicing, printing, packing to merchant exporters. The merchant exporters themselves are small units with a workforce paid in cash.
The cash crunch has halted 25 per cent of subcontracts commissioned by exporters, says T.R. Vijaya Kumar, general secretary, Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA), that has over 1,000 members. The exporters will have to deal with penalty of 20 per cent additional costs on shipments that will now be airlifted.
It’s domestic suppliers who are facing the demonetisation heat the most. They include micro units and sections that are partly, largely or fully run on cash.
The garment industry in Tiruppur has 8 lakh employees; 4 lakh in direct employment and another 4 lakh in subsidiary units such as knitting, dyeing, printing, embroidering, spinning, accessories. Of this, 20 per cent or 1.6 lakh workers are estimated to be unorganised workforce. There are 2,000 small, medium and tiny units — now facing the prospect of phased lockout — that provide work to this unorganised workforce.
Early this year, the TEA had met the Prime Minister during his visit to Coimbatore to present a ‘Vision 2020’ document to him that envisages increasing the garment industry’s turnover to Rs.1 lakh crore by 2020.
When demonetisation was announced, the exporters had cheered the decision. The TEA estimates the turnover of domestic units at Rs.7,000 crore from accounted transactions and another Rs.7,000 crore from cash transactions. On the other hand, the unorganised units solely run on cash are estimated to have a turnover of Rs.15,000 crore.
For the exporters, this is a ‘parallel economy’ with a cumulative Rs.22,000-crore turnover. “This supply chain runs on cash, weeding out taxes. If this economy is integrated, then there will be a level playing field for all,” says Vijaya Kumar.

Khaderpettai, Wednesday, 3.40 p.m.

 Jeganathan bears a distant look as he scans through a Tamil paper. He was making daily sales worth Rs.10,000-Rs.30,000 on average out of his 80-sq.-feet shop, stacked with bundles of trackpants, T-shirts of all hues. On Monday, he sent away the only daily wager he had. “Yesterday, I downed the shutter by 4 p.m.,” he says. Not a single sale on Wednesday in the shop he co-owns with his brother.
Khaderpettai market represents that parallel economy that Vijaya Kumar was talking about. It has over 3,000 shops, wholesale and retail and godowns, run solely on cash transactions. Khaderpettai lends the retail-end support for the domestic garment suppliers. They lend the rationale for business for the smaller manufacturing units, whose manufacturing orders hinge largely on the business vibrancy of Khaderpettai. Some of the garment godowns are straight extensions of the manufacturing units.
The hustle of Khaderpettai is missing since the demonetisation. Many believe things would look up once money circulation picked up.
The garment industry has a high labour demand. Attrition rate is 50 per cent, and the average labour shortage is 35 per cent. There is a general resistance both among labourers and domestic units to crediting wages through banks. Wage account entails Employees’ State Insurance and Provident Fund contribution from both ends. Labourers, with marginal wages, are not enthused at the prospect of deduction, and employers are equally unwilling to contribute.
Demonetisation has struck at the heart of this cash mode of payment of wages. Hence, ever since demonetisation, a primarily contractual workforce is migrating from smaller domestic units to export units, which credit salary through wage accounts. But the ability of smaller export units to absorb this preliminary flight of labour will unfold only in the coming days. Also, export units may not fully be insulated as the chain involves cash-based merchant exporters too.

Small is no longer beautiful

 Exporters also view demonetisation as a prelude to the nationwide rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), as a move to bring everything into accounting, force small units to migrate to wage accounts. “Once GST comes into operation in April, there will less opposition and easy integration,” predicts Vijaya Kumar.
But on the ground, there is another reality being played out. The experience of micro units and sections so far indicate a possible immiserisation of owners and workers.
While labourers just may have the option of flitting to an export unit wherever possible, marginal units such as Shaktivel’s stitching section or the yarn-knitting unit of Venkatachalam don’t have that option. At worst, they will have to close down and move into the labour market themselves.
Forty years ago, Vijaya Kumar’s father had started out with 10 workers and 10 machines. Today, he runs an export business with 1,500 workers. “If this had come then, my father would not have survived,” he agrees.
This churn will decimate small units, which are unable to migrate, have no means or know-how to systemise their business operations. This slowly would also mean that businesses can henceforth be run only by the educated, who can engage tax accountants, auditors, and dedicated personnel for documentation. “Today’s tiny units are tomorrow’s larger units. This will also mean nipping start-ups in the bud,” concedes Vijaya Kumar.
Pointing at three shuttered shops in a Khaderpettai lane, a man, who refuses to disclose his name, says that almost all shops have sent away their daily wage workers. Until last week, each shop had a Hindi-speaking worker to help negotiate with buyers from beyond the Vindhyas.
“Do you see knitwear in the street shops of Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi? They are from here. The garment units are showroom; we, Khaderpettai, are for the pavement. The poor buy from us,” he says. “We all started off lifting loads on our back and have come to own businesses. We are not educated.”",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-warp-and-woof-of-demonetisation/article16667604.ece1,

2016-11-19 00:32:00,"No demonetisation threat to voter turnout, say Dravidian majors"," With people queuing up outside banks and ATMs to source legal tender, one question that emerges in the three Assembly constituencies that go to the polls on Saturday is whether this would impact the voter turnout. A section of observers and leaders of the two Dravidian parties – the AIADMK and the DMK – feel that the turnout of voters will remain unaffected by the crisis triggered by demonetisation. 
Though the entire Tamil Nadu, like the rest of the country, has been witness to tales of hardship of people either trying to withdraw money from their accounts or exchange the demonetised notes for fresh notes, it will not come in the way of a large number of electors in the three constituencies – Thanjavur, Aravakurichi and Thiruparankundram – turning up on the election day, the parties say. In terms of popular perception, the poll for the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur constituencies is viewed more as a by-poll though election to these seats was scrapped in May this year in the wake of allegations of large-scale bribing of voters. 
In recent years, especially in the last 10 years, high voter turnout in by-elections has become the norm in the State. Of the 18 by-polls held since October 2006, on five occasions, the turnout exceeded the 80 per cent mark, and on eight occasions, it was in the range of 70 per cent to 79 per cent. In four occasions, the poll percentage varied from 60 per cent to 69 per cent, and only once, it was less than 60 per cent.
Even in the general elections, either to the Lok Sabha or to the Assembly, the turnout has been above 70 per cent. In the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the figures were 73.05 per cent and 73.74 per cent, respectively. Similarly, the 2011 and 2016 Assembly elections saw 78.29 per cent and 74.26 per cent turnout. The 2011 figure remains an all-time high for the Assembly polls. 
Discussing voter behaviour, observers and representatives of the two parties cite political mobilisation as the primary factor for their optimism. Both K.N. Nehru, the DMK’s coordinator for Thanjavur and a seasoned AIADMK Minister looking after Thiruparankundram who requested anonymity, emphasise that the campaign by their parties was quite intensive in the last two weeks. Apart from employing their senior leaders, the two parties had made their volunteers to “interact with electors frequently,” the representatives of the DMK and the AIADMK say.
“This time, the turnout will be 80 per cent in all the three constituencies,” Mr. Nehru says, confidently.
The campaign style of the two parties has prompted the Pattali Makkal Katchi to lodge a complaint with the Election Commission a few days ago, alleging widespread distribution of money.
M.G. Devesahayam, a former civil servant and now an anti-corruption activist, says the present situation, arising out of demonetisation, has been cleverly used by the political parties, considering the fact that there is enough time left for the exchange of the demonetised notes. Giving a left-handed compliment, he describes the response of the parties as a mark of “their fantastic ingenuity.” 
G, Palanithurai, Chair for Panchayati Raj Studies, Department of Political Science and Development Administration of the Gandhigram Rural Institute, says the voters are also keenly watching how the two dominant parties are reacting to the demonetisation. 
R.S. Bharathi, DMK’s Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, says that it is very likely that the people of the State would use the by-poll as an opportunity to express their resentment and anger over demonetisation, which in turn would result in increased turnout.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/No-demonetisation-threat-to-voter-turnout-say-Dravidian-majors/article16654715.ece,CHENNAI
2016-11-19 00:11:00,TNCC to protest demonetisation outside nationalised banks ," Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw currency notes of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denominations, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee said on Friday said that it would hold protests outside nationalised banks on November 21.
In a statement, TNCC president Su. Thirunavukkarasar said that the order had been implemented without any planning by the Central government. Despite repeated revisions in upper limit for banking transactions, the exemptions offered by the government will not be sufficient for a family to conduct a wedding, for which a withdrawal limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh has been set as a sovereign of gold costs over Rs. 22,000.
Mr. Thirunavukkarasar also blamed the Tamil Nadu government saying that it had not taken adequate steps to help farmers who felt “cheated” by the demonetisation. The restrictions placed on cooperative banks had stagnated the agricultural economy.
Mr. Thirunavukkarasar also raised politician and mining baron Janardhana Reddy’s daughter’s wedding saying that the Centre should check which bank had released Rs. 650 crore allegedly spent by Mr. Reddy for the wedding ceremony. 
 Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan on Friday announced that his party would hold a protest next week against the Centre for its “lack of preparedness” as regards the demonetisation issue.
 The move is a shift from the position adopted by the TMC after the Prime Minister announced his decision. Mr. Vasan’s first reaction was one of support as he termed the move as one against black money. Later, he began noting that people had been inconvenienced by the move and appealed to the Centre to ensure that people’s lives are not affected.
On Friday, in a strongly-worded statement, Mr. Vasan noted that trade had come to a standstill. He said that long queues could be seen outside banks and people living in rural areas had to travel long distances to ATMs and banks. Mr. Vasan also noted that there was scrutiny on the use of indelible ink with the Election Commission writing to the Finance Ministry about a possible impediment during the upcoming elections.

2016-11-19 00:00:00,Central co-op bank staff stage stir over demonetisation,"Members of the Vellore District Central Cooperative Bank Employees Union staged a protest demanding that the banks be allowed to exchange and accept deposits of the demonetised currencies of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000.
Delli Babu, general secretary of the union, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued a notification on November 14 that the District Central Cooperative Banks should not exchange the two currencies nor accept deposits from its customers.
There are 34 branches of the District Central Cooperative Bank operating in Vellore district.
“We were accepting the two notes for exchange and as deposits from customers since the announcement for demonetising the two notes was made. But we stopped accepting the two currencies after the notification from the RBI. This has affected the bank customers to a large extent,” he said.
The bank has nearly two lakh customers in the district, with its branches in rural areas having a majority of farmers as customers. “As we are not accepting the two notes, inconvenience is caused to customers and they are saying they will close the accounts,” he added.
The union said that the RBI should permit the Central Cooperative Banks to exchange the notes.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Central-co-op-bank-staff-stage-stir-over-demonetisation/article16668125.ece,VELLORE
2016-11-19 22:58:00,Banks worried over stock of demonetised currency,"ADILABAD: Banks operating in the four districts — Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal — are now worried over safety of the building stock of demonetised currency notes in different branches as most of the over 300 bank branches in the four districts do not have ‘proper’ strongrooms.
On an average, the main branch of State Bank of Hyderabad in Adilabad town, which is also the Lead Bank, is receiving demonetised currency notes with a face value of Rs. 8 crore every day while some others in important centres like Mancherial and Nirmal are receiving about Rs. 3 crore in old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. The rest of the branches of the 31 banks have received the demonetised notes with a face value of about Rs. 1.5 to Rs. 2 crore by way of exchange during the last 10 days.
“Many of our branches in rural areas have about Rs. 2 crore each of demonetised currency notes and safety is the main concern as these branches operate out of private premises which do not have proper strongrooms,” pointed out an official of the Telangana Grameena Bank, which has over 100 branches under its two Regional Offices operating in the rural areas of the four districts. “The SBH, our sponsor bank and the chest branch, should take the notes as our bank will stand to lose heavily in case of any eventuality,” added the worried officer.
“Banks can transport the banned currency notes to their own chests as we too are flooded with the exchanged notes. We will accept once RBI clears our pile,” clarified SBH Assistant General Manager P. Umamaheswara Rao.
Allocation of notes
The TBG has also accused the SBH of discrimination in apportioning of cash for day-to-day operations in its branches. “We are disbursing cash judiciously because of the crunch we are facing,” the AGM explained.
“The SBH main branch disburses about Rs. 10 lakh to each of the 10 banks which have their accounts with it while it gives Rs. 50 lakh to the TGB which operates 21 branches. It is not enough for our operations as we have a large customer base and serve in rural areas,” the TGB official noted.
The constraint imposed by demonetisation on banking operations is likely to ease somewhat as the government has restricted the quantum value of exchange of old notes to Rs. 2,000. “The move will certainly bring down the demand for valid currency notes,” Mr. Umamaheswara Rao agreed.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Banks-worried-over-stock-of-demonetised-currency/article16658543.ece,
2016-11-19 00:00:00,ICAI members hail demonetisation,": The chartered accountants praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing demonetisation of high denomination currency notes to keep a check on unaccounted money.
At an awareness programme organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party, here on Friday, Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI) Karimnagar chapter chairman D. Niranjana Chary hailed the bold decision of the Union Government.
He said the demonetisation would check terrorism and hoarding of unaccounted money.
Allaying fears among the people, he said that they would not face any problem in banking transactions with their legal money.
He said that presenting the PAN card number was mandatory in the banking system if a customer withdraws more than Rs. 50,000.
The institute office-bearers K. Venkateshwarlu, G. Anand Kumar, N. Varaprasad, Y. Anil Kumar, K. Rammohan, BJP official spokesperson Bandi Sanjay Kumar and others participated in the programme. They said that the demonetisation would help reduce prices in the real-estate sector and there would be no registrations of properties under fictitious names. It would also have an impact on the fee of management-quota seats in professional colleges.
They also said that people would be habituated to do more banking transactions and there would be more deposits in the banks helping the bankers in providing more loans at lower interest rates.
They also clarified that the CAs would only tell the people on how to manage taxes and help the Government get its revenue.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ICAI-members-hail-demonetisation/article16667992.ece,KARIMNAGAR

2016-11-19 22:47:00,Demonetisation good in the long run: Cummins ," While the government’s move to demonetise old Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes may negatively impact businesses in the short-term, Cummins Inc has said it did not intend to re-look at business strategy in India as it expected the long-term effect of the move to be positive.
“It looks like it will definitely have a negative impact on businesses in the short run. In the long run, it is a very good thing to do. The government is trying to deal with corruption at a broader level, bring more people into the regular economy. This is a positive,” Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO, Cummins Inc told The Hindu when asked about demonetisation. Cummins makes diesel and natural gas engines and is into related technologies.
He added, “The industry expects a lot of short-term pain and we will deal with it… In the trucking industry we are already seeing the impact…But again, in the long run, it feels right.”
Mr. Linebarger, who was in the national capital to be part of CII’s Clean Air Initiative, said the company would not take a re-look at strategies for India business. “No, we will not re-strategise on anything. We always look forward to steps that take India to modernisation… more openness, transparency and ease of making investments.”
On the focus on automobiles to curb pollution, he said, “The automobile is part of the solution, but it won’t be the only part... It seems too easy to pick just one thing and say we will stop large-engine cars.

2016-11-19 10:02:00,"No demonetisation threat to voter turnout, say Dravidian majors"," With people queuing up outside banks and ATMs to source legal tender, one question that emerges in the three Assembly constituencies that go to the polls on Saturday is whether this would impact the voter turnout. A section of observers and leaders of the two Dravidian parties – the AIADMK and the DMK – feel that the turnout of voters will remain unaffected by the crisis triggered by demonetisation. 
Though the entire Tamil Nadu, like the rest of the country, has been witness to tales of hardship of people either trying to withdraw money from their accounts or exchange the demonetised notes for fresh notes, it will not come in the way of a large number of electors in the three constituencies – Thanjavur, Aravakurichi and Thiruparankundram – turning up on the election day, the parties say. 
In terms of popular perception, the poll for the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur constituencies is viewed more as a by-poll though election to these seats was scrapped in May this year in the wake of allegations of large-scale bribing of voters. 
In recent years, especially in the last 10 years, high voter turnout in by-elections has become the norm in the State. Of the 18 by-polls held since October 2006, on five occasions, the turnout exceeded the 80 per cent mark, and on eight occasions, it was in the range of 70 per cent to 79 per cent. In four occasions, the poll percentage varied from 60 per cent to 69 per cent, and only once, it was less than 60 per cent.
Even in the general elections, either to the Lok Sabha or to the Assembly, the turnout has been above 70 per cent. In the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the figures were 73.05 per cent and 73.74 per cent, respectively. Similarly, the 2011 and 2016 Assembly elections saw 78.29 per cent and 74.26 per cent turnout. 
The 2011 figure remains an all-time high for the Assembly elections. 
Discussing voter behaviour, observers and representatives of the two parties cite political mobilisation as the primary factor for their optimism. Both K.N. Nehru, the DMK’s coordinator for Thanjavur and a seasoned AIADMK Minister looking after Thiruparankundram who requested anonymity, emphasise that the campaign by their parties was quite intensive in the last two weeks. Apart from employing their senior leaders, the two parties had made their volunteers to “interact with electors frequently,” the representatives of the DMK and the AIADMK say.
“This time, the turnout will be 80 per cent in all the three constituencies,” Mr. Nehru says, confidently.
The campaign style of the two parties has prompted the Pattali Makkal Katchi to lodge a complaint with the Election Commission a few days ago, alleging widespread distribution of money.
M.G. Devesahayam, a former civil servant and now an anti-corruption activist, says the present situation, arising out of demonetisation, has been cleverly used by the political parties, considering the fact that there is enough time left for the exchange of the demonetised notes. Giving a left-handed compliment, he describes the response of the parties as a mark of “their fantastic ingenuity.” 
G, Palanithurai, Chair for Panchayati Raj Studies, Department of Political Science and Development Administration of the Gandhigram Rural Institute, says the voters are also keenly watching how the two dominant parties are reacting to the demonetisation. 
R.S. Bharathi, DMK’s Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, says that it is very likely that the people of the State would use the by-poll as an opportunity to express their resentment and anger over demonetisation, which in turn would result in increased turnout.",Chennai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/No-demonetisation-threat-to-voter-turnout-say-Dravidian-majors/article16656762.ece,CHENNAI
2016-11-19 00:00:00,Trust in the time of demonetisation,"Many years ago, a man called Francis Fukuyama proposed an economic theory that rested on trust. He argued that economic development would be based on the amount of trust each society displayed in non-kin relationships.
In his 1996 publication, Trust , he said: “One of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nation’s well being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.”
This past week, we’ve probably come out with flying colours in Fukuyama test. Since demonetisation reduced liquidity in the market, with limited sectors accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as legal tender, and the insufficiency of notes to replace the currency, this society has moved on, thanks largely to trust. At a micro level, people, traders and vendors who are used to cash transactions on a daily basis, sought refuge in credit and trust, hoping the tide would turn again. For autorickshaw drivers, watercan suppliers, milkmen, tea shops and small roadside eateries with their loyal clientele, it was easy to slip into credit mode.
Vanessa Peter, who often takes autorickshaws to commute to work, found it was exactly this which came to her rescue when she hailed an auto at the stand near her house in Kodambakkam, after the demonetisation drive left her short of change.
It is not all profit for Samivelu, a water bubble-top supplier in Madipakkam. He said all his customers had promptly made payments all these days, and he felt that water being an essential commodity, it was his duty to ensure they got the water, even if he had to supply it all on credit.
In Coimbatore, several builders have requested the grocery outlets and tea stalls near their construction sites to give products on credit to their workers.
With a shortage in the availability of cash to pay weekly wages for the workers, they have only paid an advance amount to these workers. Dhanalakshmi, who has rented out two houses to workers, says her tenants were unable to pay the rent. “How can I ask them when they have not received their wages properly? I know they will pay up when they get money,” she says.
At Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity.
“Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions,” said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association. “Retail traders who purchase onions from us say they will pay after selling the produce. We realise their position and allow them to take the stocks on credit. We know we may have to wait for even up to a month to get the money,” he said.
The same with suppliers. J. Madhavan, who runs a stationery shop in Madurai, said the daily sale of school and college notebooks and accounts books used to be around Rs. 25,000 a day but had plummeted to Rs. 2,000 a day since the announcement. Regular customers like representatives of educational institutions, who used to seek only discounts on notebooks, were now seeking credit for want of currency notes. He had no option but to oblige.
Petty shopkeepers too say that sales on credit are on the rise.
There’s also trust from the other side. There are regular customers who pay up tea stalls and vegetable vendors larger notes and ask them to hold the change against future purchases. A bakery owner from Salem says he sells goods on credit only to known customers, and politely turns away others. T. Arunkumar, an advocate at the Madras High Court, said stamp vendors from whom he regularly purchased stamp papers were now lending them on credit.

2016-11-19 00:00:00,Traders flay Centre for demonetisation,"Traders affiliated to Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai have condemned the Central government for demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.
A group of traders of the forum who staged a demonstration in the city on Friday charged the Central government of trying to destroy retail traders who had been serving the common people through the demonetisation.
It had severely hit the retail trade. If the general public was facing hardship on the one hand to buy even essential commodities, retail traders were facing difficulty in selling their stock, the protestors said.
If the government had identified and imprisoned black money holders, gangs involved in circulation of fake currency notes, bank loan defaulters, those depositing their ill-gotten wealth in banks abroad and corrupt politicians, the culture of black money and fake currency could have been wiped out. Should the common man and traders be punished for the inefficiency of officials and those in governance, the protestors said.
The Central government had announced this decision with the intention that business should not take place in the shops of retail traders. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were competing to protect foreign trade and destroy domestic trade, they said.

2016-11-19 10:13:00,Traders flay Centre for demonetisation,"Traders affiliated to Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai have condemned the Central government for demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.
A group of traders of the forum who staged a demonstration in the city on Friday charged the Central government of trying to destroy retail traders who had been serving the common people through the demonetisation.
It had severely hit the retail trade. If the general public was facing hardship on the one hand to buy even essential commodities, retail traders were facing difficulty in selling their stock, the protestors said.
If the government had identified and imprisoned black money holders, gangs involved in circulation of fake currency notes, bank loan defaulters, those depositing their ill-gotten wealth in banks abroad and corrupt politicians, the culture of black money and fake currency could have been wiped out. Should the common man and traders be punished for the inefficiency of officials and those in governance, the protestors said.
The Central government had announced this decision with the intention that business should not take place in the shops of retail traders. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were competing to protect foreign trade and destroy domestic trade, they said.

2016-11-19 00:00:00,Demonetisation will not hit informal economy: BJP,"Informal economy will not be crippled by demonetisation, and real productive economy in agriculture, tiny and micro enterprises will improve, BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao has said.
On the other hand, the highly extortionist practices of daily finance would be hit to some extent, he told reporters here on Friday.
Describing demonetisation as the beginning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war against black economy, fulfilling the 2014 election mandate, he said it would bring down inflation very soon and curb speculation in gold and land. Consequently, their rates would come down, bringing them within the reach of the common people.

‘Historic step’

Describing demonetisation as a historic step and not a decision in isolation, he said it would bring about fundamental changes in political and economic system, including simultaneous elections and State-funding of elections. The war also could later be taken to black money in the form of gold and land.

People to benefit

The war against black money would ultimately benefit the people and that was the reason why the Prime Minister appealed to the people to bear with the inconvenience for 50 days.
He addressed the nation because he knew about the problems that would arise from demonetisation of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation.
He said that the Rs.2,000 note was not a substitute for Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, and RBI had not indicated the volume of Rs.2,000 notes it would print. The demand for higher denomination notes could not be estimated and the government was seized of the matter.

Higher revenues

Demonetisation would result in considerably higher revenues for State and Central governments, enabling them take up construction of schools, hospitals, etc., Mr. Rao said.
Mr. Modi had taken up the issue of bringing back black money stashed abroad, and because of limitations in international laws it could not be achieved, he said.
The government, however, would not compromise on black money abroad. A SIT was constituted at the first Cabinet meeting. The mandate against black money was not divided, Mr. Rao said.
BJP Floor leader in the Assembly P. Vishnu Kumar Raju, city president M. Nagendra and leaders Ch. Ramakotaiah and P.V.N. Madhav were present.

“It should be viewed as an initiative to change the country rather than as a process of changing notes,” he said at the 3rd G. Ramachandran Memorial Lecture organised by The Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
“Banks would be flooded with deposits, which can be used to create a multiplier effect by circulating them back in the economy,” he said. The move will increase the tax base, which is very important to curb the parallel black money economy.

2016-11-20 22:27:00,Unite against demonetisation: Uddhav to traders,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday asked the country’s trader community to unite against the Central government’s demonetisation initiative, and assured them of the party’s support.
On Sunday, a delegation of traders held a meeting with Mr. Thackeray to explain hardships being faced by the trading community. “Not only your generation, but even the next generation is going to suffer from this decision. Are you going to remain silent? Do not sit idle and shed tears. Be prepared to fight against this autocratic decision,” Mr. Thackeray said.
“He (Narendra Modi) was elected by the country’s 125-crore population, which was disillusioned with Congress rule. This population should have been taken into confidence before any such decision,” he said.
Earlier, a delegation of traders held a meeting with the Sena chief, where he was informed that the trading business has taken a 70-per cent hit due to demonetisation. “Our business has come to a complete standstill. November and December are usually the best profit- making months for us, but demonetisation has completely changed the picture,” Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said after meeting. He added that the association has conveyed its problems to the Prime Minister in the past. “The government has taken the decision without adequate homework,” he said.
Biren Lambichiya, another officer bearer of the association, said retail traders helped Mr. Modi come to power. “But now he is taking steps against us,” he said.
Despite these strong opinions from the trading community, the Sena chief chose to not speak out against demonetisation. When asked whether he supports the traders’ demands, he asked other Sena leaders to speak.
Sena leaders have made controversial statements in the last week. Party MP Anand Adsul said the Sena will withdraw support if the District Central Co-operative Banks are not allowed to exchange old notes. He later withdrew the statement. Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana wrote an editorial claiming Mr. Modi’s decision has led to financial anarchy. Several Sena MPs even participated in the protest walk organised by Opposition parties in Delhi against demonetisation. It was rumoured that Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had even called Mr. Thackeray asking him to not participate in the protest march.
Questioning the rationale behind the Jan Dhan scheme, Mr. Thackeray said the country’s farmers have opened accounts under scheme. “Now, by bringing restrictions on district central co-operative banks, the government is harming farmers’ interests. What was the rationale behind starting this scheme if you wanted to keep an eye on them as well?” he asked.",Mumbai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Unite-against-demonetisation-Uddhav-to-traders/article16661429.ece,
2016-11-20 00:00:00,Sculptors feel the pinch of demonetisation,"The demonetisation has put a group of families engaged in making stone idols at Nagalapuram village, bordering the Tiruchi-Perambalur districts, in a soup.
At least 15 finished idols have been gathering dust at each shop -- (called ‘pattarai’ in local parlance) -- in the village, as most of those who placed orders have not come forward to take delivery for want of small denomination currencies.
The village accounts for three major ‘pattarai’ each ‘pattarai’ having a strength of at least 10 labourers.
Thus, as many as 30 workers have been left in the lurch as they are unable to get wages for their work.
The men are involved in making idols, mostly catering to the needs of rural temples. These sculptors have learnt the art from their forefathers and are skilled in making different forms of gods and goddesses.
Lord Ganapathy, Sri Perumal, Sri Chellayi Amman, Sri Ondikaruppanna Swamy and Sri Mariamman are the main deities for which there has been a consistent demand.
Each idol is priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 depending on its size and intricate carvings involved. “Although we had readied the idols based on orders, most of them have been idling at our shops,” says G. Venugopal, one of the ‘pattarai’ owners.
The major financial set back he faces is due to the huge investment on idols of bigger size with intricate craftsmanship. Two idols -- Sri Chandikeswari and Sri Bairavar - which were priced at Rs. 1.25 lakh each are yet to be taken. The height of the idol is 5.5 feet and involves complex workmanship,” he said.
Although he had taken an advance, it was just part of the expenditure meant for the stone and labour wages.
Another sculptor, V. Lakshminarayanan, said that labourers were finding it difficult to eke out their livelihood, although they could manage by exchanging the old currencies.
Every ‘pattarai’ disburses wages on monthly basis on the first working day every month. ‘We do not know what to do on December 1, when we should disburse wages. We only hope that the situation would ease by then,” he said.
Workers who have pinned their hopes on their masters, have been working with their chisels and hammers.
The sculptors said that they purchase stones from Oothukuli for making the idols. “We first ascertain the quality of stones so that we do not incur any loss due to any defect,” Mr. Venugopal says. They accept the order and work on an idol after taking an advance from the temple authorities. “We have stocked a large number of idols in our thatched shed, all awaiting delivery,” he says.

2016-11-20 00:00:00,Demonetisation hits winter wear sales by Tibetans,"Like ever year, Tibetan refugees from Odisha, Karnataka and other parts of the country came to the city a month ago with loads of winter wear.
They had set up shops on the canal bund, near Alankar Centre, and began sale a fortnight ago with the hopes of making profits at the end of the season.
Unfortunately, the announcement of demonetisation and the subsequent fall in sales of their products only indicates a dull business for them.
Post announcement of withdrawal of the Old High Denomination bank notes, the sales at these special stalls plummeted.
One of the traders from Chandragiri in Odisha, Tenzil Dorjee, says, “Business is very dull since the day one. Post withdrawal of high value currency, the number of visitors too came down. It seems the situation continues further.”
The traders are also finding it difficult to exchange their cash which they got through sales before November 8.
“Only a few customers are giving Rs. 2,000 notes and buying stuff worth that much. Otherwise we are unable to given change in Rs. 100 notes or accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations,” said another trader.
All the traders, in an understanding, fix the prices of their products ranging from shawls to sport jackets, including hand woven products.
Not just demonetisation, but also lack of cool weather is affecting the sales.
“The temperature is not cool enough for people to buy woollen wear yet. Even this is a reason for poor sales and we faced this the last year too,” Mr. Dorjee, a full-time farmer said.
Each trader makes a business of Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 4 lakh during their three-month stay here. The sale ends in mid of January next year.

2016-11-20 20:46:00,Demonetisation woes continue ,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The closure of banks, for the first time after demonetisation by the government, added to the woes of the public on Sunday. Customers were greeted by ‘not working’ boards at many of the ATMs, some ATMs downed their shutters, while others witnessed long queues.
Long queues were seen at the ATMs of SBI at Dwaraka Nagar and Rednam Gardens on Sunday. The HDFC Bank ATM at Dwarakanagar also witnessed long line of customers while the ICICI ATMs at Madhavadhara and Dwarakanagar downed shutters. People were seen trying to exchange their Old High Denomination (OHD) notes at fuel stations. 
Small traders, fish vendors and the general public continued to face problems even after 12 days of the government’s decision on big notes. 
“Motorists have stopped coming for repairs unless they feel it absolutely important to go for immediate repairs. Some are bringing old Rs.500 notes for repairs costing Rs.100 or so and we cannot give them change,” said Tata Rao, a motorcycle mechanic, who has his shop beside Sankar Matham. 
“We are telling customers that if they give Rs.2000 note, the bill should be at least Rs.1600 or more. Our cash transactions dropped by around 50 per cent. On the positive side, however, we have noticed a quantum jump in card transactions,” said an employee of a restaurant near Diamond Park.
There is a drastic fall in fish sales at the Nehru Bazaar. “Customers are giving Rs.2000 note for making purchases of Rs.200. This is for the first time that we are experiencing such a problem,” said Pydamma, who has been selling fish for the past 30 years.
“We used to make sales to the tune of Rs.15,000 a day before demonetisation. Now we hardly make around Rs.5,000. You can estimate how much we are losing every day,” said Kodanda, another fish vendor. 
The fish market near RTC Complex presented a different picture with many vendors accepting OHD notes. “We are accepting OHD notes as we cannot afford to lose business. The dip in sales is partly due to the auspicious Karteeka masam, when many consumers avoid taking non-vegetarian food.
It was a similar story at the Fishing Harbour on Sunday. The normally busy vendors were seen awaiting customers. “Demonetisation is good but the poor could have been given the OHD notes instead of dumping them in the drains,” said Lakshmi, a vendor.",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Demonetisation-woes-continue/article16661189.ece,
2016-11-20 21:49:00,Demonetisation hits buffalo meat exporters,"NEW DELHI: With the demonetisation exercise severely hitting their operations, meat exporters have asked the government to lift curbs on cash withdrawal and related transactions to help them pay the traders as well as small and marginal farmers from whom they purchase buffaloes for slaughter.
The All India Meat & Livestock Exporters Association (AIMLEA), in a representation to the commerce ministry, complained that the withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 a week from the current account was not enough for these exporters to pay the entire chain of people – including traders (middlemen who purchase the buffaloes from farmers) and subsistence farmers - for the bovines, official sources said. They added that AIMLEA wants cash withdrawal and transaction curbs to be either done away with or eased. The commerce ministry has forwarded the representation to the finance ministry for further action. According to the AIMLEA, farmers who sell the bovines are mostly poor and without any bank account, and therefore, they are paid in cash, which they in turn use for activities including purchasing seeds and fertilisers and running their households. The buffalo meat sector in the country is largely unorganised. The regulators for the sector include the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority that falls under the commerce ministry’s jurisdiction as well as the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (under the health & family welfare ministry).
Similar complaints from exporters in other sectors, on the problems that they are facing due to the demonetisation policy, are being compiled, sources said, adding that the commerce ministry will soon hold discussions on the issue with representatives from various Export Promotion Councils. An August 2016 report by ICRA Ltd said, “Indian buffalo meat exports have grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29 per cent, from Rs.3,533 crore in FY08 to Rs.26,682 crore in FY16, enabling (the country) to overtake its close competitors Brazil and Australia to become the largest exporter of buffalo meat/beef, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of the world’s total buffalo meat/beef exports (in volume terms).”
Buffalo meat has been the highest agri-related export item from India for the past two consecutive years and its contribution to the total export revenues of India has almost doubled to 1.56 per cent in FY2016 from 0.76 per cent in FY2011, it said. ICRA said it estimated that buffalo meat export revenues will grow to about Rs.40,000 crore by FY21, at a CAGR of eight per cent. The Indian buffalo meat sector has boomed thanks to the buffalo population increasing to 108.7 million in 2012 (as per the 2012 all India livestock census) from 43.4 million in 1951.",Business,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Demonetisation-hits-buffalo-meat-exporters/article16661374.ece,

Lashing out at the BJP government, Mr. Jogi, the chief of the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress, said the demonetisation decision was taken with an eye on the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
“It was a badly planned move. The same objective could have been achieved by planning its implementation in a better manner.

It is becoming difficult for farmers and common people in the rural areas to manage the day-to-day life,” Mr. Jogi said.

“We have been making endless visits to the ATMs from the past couple of days, but at most places there’s no cash. In fact, we took out ₹ 10,000 in the denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 just the day the demonetisation news broke. Now, we are stuck with several notes which are useless,” said Rebecca Honeycone from Canterbury, a cathedral city in southeast England. 
Rebecca is in Visakhapatnam with her husband Phillip to cheer the England cricket team as part of her India tour itinerary which began from October this year. 
“Our everyday expenses have escalated way beyond what we planned. We had to upgrade from homestays to bigger hotels which accept credit cards. If we go to see any tourist monument, the fee for a foreign tourist is ₹ 500 but nobody is accepting the ₹ 500 notes as a result we had to skip several such tourist places because we are guarding whatever little lower denomination notes we are left with for emergency needs,” said Phillip, her husband. “Some banks refused to entertain us as we are foreigners. Tomorrow we head to Hyderabad and there again will begin a next chapter for the hunt of ₹ 100 notes!” quipped Rebecca.
There are hundreds of England cricket fans, who currently in Visakhapatnam and on an India tour, including the organised cricket fan groups like the Barmy Army that are often termed as the England team’s unofficial 12th man. Most of them said that they were facing problems as they mostly have the old ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes or are given ₹ 2,000 notes at airport forex counters. In Visakhapatnam, like in many other Indian cities, majority of ATMs are still not functioning properly. 
Oliver Terry from Nottingham, England, who was enjoying the cricket match on Sunday with several other England fans said: “Hotels and bars are the only places where we are finding change for ₹ 2,000 notes. We are buying beer cans and food collectively as a group for a high value bill. We have also noticed that most of the local vendors and stores are not willing to part with change.” 
“If we want to go out and see some tourist place, we cannot go as the taxi driver or autorickshaws are demanding new currency notes or money in lower denomination. We are not able to taste local delicacies or buy a pack of cigarettes as the stores are refusing to take old notes or give us change for the few ₹ 2,000 notes we are left with,” said John, another England cricket fan. His group fears that the Indian currency they hold in ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 denominations may go waste. John displayed his wallet containing wads of ₹ 1,000 and ₹ 500 notes and said: “I got several British pounds changed to rupees. What will happen to those notes?”
Andrew Gosden from Lymington Hampshire said that this time he may have to disappoint his friends and family members back home as he doesn’t have enough lower denomination currencies to purchase souvenirs. “It is Christmas season for us and obviously my family will be eagerly waiting for me to get them some Indian souvenirs. But I am finding it tough to get change for the souvenirs in the local shops in cities,” he added.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-stumps-England-cricket-fans-and-tourists/article16661248.ece,VISAKHAPATNAM

At a rally here, he said it appears the move was implemented without considering the risks involved and nobody even in the BJP was aware of it.

2016-11-20 03:00:00,Demonetisation: Centre sends teams to study impact,"Having resolved to stay the course and see through the implementation of the Prime Minister’s decision on withdrawal of 500- and 1000-rupee notes from circulation, the Union Government late on Friday night announced that a team of officials from the centre was being rushed to different States for a spot assessment of the situation arising out of the demonetisation.
According to a senior official, who did not wish to be quoted, “Coming in the face of logjam in Parliament and conflicting voices from chief ministers across the country, this decision is intended to convey that there is no going back on Mr. Modi’s announcement. At the maximum New Delhi is ready to look into the possible short and medium term measures to alleviate the suffering of the people from all walks of life and of the business and industry.”
Jagannath Srinivasan, a director-level officer in the Ministry of Personnel and Pension, on Friday night issued an office memorandum listing the names of the officers who have been deputed to different States and Union Territories.
“The undersigned is directed to refer to the above mentioned subject and to say that the following officers are hereby deputed to undertake field visits in various States (as listed below) for making on the spot assessment of the situation and to provide feedback thereon,” the memorandum said.
A senior official in the ministry told The Hindu that respective teams from each assigned State would submit a report to the government on how exactly the decision of the Prime Minister is being implemented. “They would, of course, identify the bottlenecks in the system so that whatever course correction is required from New Delhi can be applied.”
The official said that the Centre is ready to look at demands from various quarters, be it the State governments or the industry and commerce circles to see how best the ‘pain’ could be minimised.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Centre-sends-teams-to-study-impact/article16668964.ece,NEW DELHI

DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, in a statement, said the protest will be held between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. and called upon traders, workers and farmers to take part in it. The DMK’s district secretaries will lead the human chain. 
“There seems to be no end to the suffering of people caused by the scrapping of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The poor and daily wage workers are standing in queue for hours and traders have been severely affected by the lack of smaller denomination of currencies,” Mr. Karunanidhi said.

2016-11-20 01:10:00,‘Demonetisation is a transformative move’," Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move is bold and transformative, as well as a very profound and important moment in India’s history, said Jayant Sinha, Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation. 
“It should be viewed as an initiative to change the country rather than as a process of changing notes,” he said at the 3rd G. Ramachandran Memorial Lecture organised by The Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
“Banks would be flooded with deposits, which can be used to create a multiplier effect by circulating them back in the economy,” he said. The move will increase the tax base, which is very important to curb the parallel black money economy. 
The flow of counterfeit currency from Bangladesh and other countries has stopped. The move will give a massive boost to the digital economy, he said. 
“Our economy will be less cash and more digital. This would lead to lot of digital innovation where fin-tech firms will thrive,” he noted.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/%E2%80%98Demonetisation-is-a-transformative-move%E2%80%99/article16659112.ece,CHENNAI
2016-11-20 00:00:00,Banks worried over safety of demonetised currency,"Banks operating in the four districts — Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal — are now worried over safety of the building stock of demonetised currency notes in different branches as most of the over 300 bank branches in the four districts do not have ‘proper’ strongrooms.
On an average, the main branch of State Bank of Hyderabad in Adilabad town, which is also the Lead Bank, is receiving demonetised currency notes with a face value of Rs. 8 crore every day while some others in important centres like Mancherial and Nirmal are receiving about Rs. 3 crore in old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. The rest of the branches of the 31 banks have received the demonetised notes with a face value of about Rs. 1.5 to Rs. 2 crore by way of exchange during the last 10 days.

Piling up

“Many of our branches in rural areas have about Rs. 2 crore each of demonetised currency notes and safety is the main concern as these branches operate out of private premises which do not have proper strongrooms,” pointed out an official of the Telangana Grameena Bank, which has over 100 branches under its two Regional Offices operating in the rural areas of the four districts. “The SBH, our sponsor bank and the chest branch, should take the notes as our bank will stand to lose heavily in case of any eventuality,” added the worried officer.
“Banks can transport the banned currency notes to their own chests as we too are flooded with the exchanged notes. We will accept once RBI clears our pile,” clarified SBH Assistant General Manager P. Umamaheswara Rao.

Allocation of notes

The TBG has also accused the SBH of discrimination in apportioning of cash for day-to-day operations in its branches. “We are disbursing cash judiciously because of the crunch we are facing,” the AGM explained.
“The SBH main branch disburses about Rs. 10 lakh to each of the 10 banks which have their accounts with it while it gives Rs. 50 lakh to the TGB which operates 21 branches. It is not enough for our operations as we have a large customer base and serve in rural areas,” the TGB official noted.
The constraint imposed by demonetisation on banking operations is likely to ease somewhat as the government has restricted the quantum value of exchange of old notes to Rs. 2,000. “The move will certainly bring down the demand for valid currency notes,” Mr. Umamaheswara Rao agreed.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Banks-worried-over-safety-of-demonetised-currency/article16668815.ece,ADILABAD
2016-11-20 00:53:00,19-11-01-Demonetisation-Weddings,"New Delhi: The big, fat Delhi wedding seems to have gone on a diet thanks to the ongoing demonetisation exercise. From band wallahs to ghodi wallahs and from caterers to photographers, the crunch in liquid cash has affected every service provider with families of brides and grooms mutually agreeing to trim excess expenditure.
Sixty-year-old Sunil Kashyap (name changed), whose daughter got married on November 12, said the sudden deficit in liquid cash had left fathers like him no option. “I remember sweating while I stood in line outside an ATM at 2 a.m. — my third since the announcement earlier in the evening of November 8 — wondering how, if at all, we would be able to pull it off,” he said.
Fortunately for him, Mr. Kashyap said, the banquet hall owner and caterer had been paid most of their dues in advance a week ago; however, exchange gifts ranging from fruit baskets to blankets and bedsheets still needed to be purchased and led him to a local currency dealer who demanded a 10 per cent commission to exchange Rs, 100 notes for older notes.
“I decided not to risk it and promised the guests that their exchange gifts would be delivered to them as soon as I could purchase them with my debit card; what I do regret is that even the milni (the ceremonial introduction of family members from both sides accompanied with an exchange of money) had to be done with old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes,” Mr. Kashyap added. 
Ashok Chadha, a businessman based in Noida, said the cash crunch had led him to dispense with the ceremonial ghodi ( arrival of the groom ona horse) and cut down on the contingent of band wallahs (musicians) from his son's wedding on November 25.
“I've told the band company owner to spare as big or small a group that he can with the cash advance I gave him and my son's in-laws say they have no issues with him turning up in the doli (ceremonial palanquin) instead of a ghodi to pick up his bride. Postponing or cancelling a wedding is too much to handle – better a small wedding than none,” he said.
Decisions like Mr. Chadha's, said Virender Singh from the popular Chawla Band in Karol Bagh, had severely affected his business. “As if the fact that walk-in customers have completely stopped making enquiries wasn't enough, bookings are being cancelled every day because of the cash crunch. We have begun taking post-dated cheques so that the entire wedding season doesn't go to waste,” he said.
Gaurav from Sindhi Hira Nand Ghori Wale, one of the oldest wedding planners in the Capital based out of Beadon Pura in Karol Bagh's Band Market said the cash crunch had completely crippled business. 
“Business is destroyed either way because of the lack of liquidity. Even if we accept payment cheque, how will we pay our staff who work solely on a per-day and cash payment basis like daily wagers?” he complained.
Mohit Birla from Mohit Birla Photography, said business had been affected “to some extent” but not as severely as one would expect. “I do not work on cash as a principle but business has been affected to a small degree; I had ten bookings this month out of which one had to be cancelled because the party seemed to have run out of cash but the others are scheduled as per plan,” he said. 
Vijender Singh Rawat, a caterer operating out of Kaushambi, said he was operating on credit. “A marriage isn't something that either family can afford to postpone or cancel so we are doing all we can to offer clients our services on credit basis if they can't afford to pay through cheque at the moment,” he said.

2016-11-20 00:00:00,Demonetisation hits liquor sale in Odisha,"The demonetisation of high value currency notes has adversely affected the sale of liquor across Odisha with most of the outlets reporting a decline in sales even as queues outside ATMs and banks continued to swell.
Of the total 3,843 liquor shops in the state, 50 per cent have reported a decline in sales following banning of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes from November 8 mid-night, an official at the excise department said.
In this backdrop Excise Revenue collection is likely to be badly hit even as the State government has set a target of Rs 3,300 crore collection during the ongoing fiscal.
While the excise collection in 2015-16 was Rs 2,568 crore, this time the government expected an additional Rs 800 crore.
The liquor is supplied to the licensed shops through Odisha State Beverage Corporation Limited (OSBC).
The business of the Corporation has been considerably less during November in several districts as compared to earlier months, the official said, adding that the volume of liquor sale has also slipped in hotels and restaurants.
The excise personnel on the basis of feedback received from sale counters acknowledged that the IMFL and country liquor sale plummeted drastically.
“Though we do not maintain weekly sale records, the sale of both IMFL and country spirit has made a nosedive drastically. The officials at the ground level have informed regarding the fall of sale of liquor of all varieties,” said Kendrapara district Excise Superintendent, Ram Narayan Seth.
Jagatsinghpur Excise Superintendent Rajat Kuamar Praharaj also reported about a similar situation in his district.
“The number of consumers visiting the shop has dropped considerably since the November 8 announcement. The average daily sale in our counter was more than Rs 5,000 earlier. But now it has come down to Rs 2,000 or less. We are not entertaining customers who are visiting to buy liquor with demonetised notes,” said the manager of an IMFL counter in Kendrapara, Sudam Charan Sahu.
“We do not want to disappoint the regular customers. We are accepting scrapped notes for liquor. However we have fixed a ceiling for purchase of Rs 350 or more. We are forced to do so as there is possibility of regular customers skipping visit to our shop in future,” a staffer in another retail IMFL shop, Rajani Mohanty, said.
Decline in liquor sale is also affecting small eateries.
“I was earning about Rs 5000 daily prior to November 8. It has now come down to Rs 1000,” said Brundaban Sahu, a roadside eatery owner near an IMFL shop. - PTI

2016-11-20 22:47:00,Demonetisation: SCB realises a fifth of its annual revenue," The Secunderabad Cantonment Board has realised more than a fifth of its annual revenue in the last ten days alone, thanks to the demonetisation decision.
The board raked in over Rs. 6 crore, largely in property tax, after it decided to accept payments in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. The SCB began accepting the demonetised currency on November 11. Officials say that they expect more revenue in the coming days.
“A large chunk of the payments are from those who had not paid earlier. After an initial dilemma over whether the old notes should be accepted or not, we began the collections,” informed an SCB official.
SCB’s revenue collection has increased in the recent years, mainly through revision of property tax rates and stringent collection norms. However, the collection has remained well below Rs. 50 crore, though talk of a potential Rs. 100 crore collection is common. With four more days to go before the deadline for acceptance of old notes elapses, taxmen are hopeful of more revenue collection.
The SCB’s collection of toll tax at the entry and exit points is now being questioned as the Centre has exempted toll payment till November 24. A former ward member, Jai Prakash, made a representation to the SCB asking for exemption.
When contacted, an SCB official, on condition of anonymity, said the toll collection was exempted on the highway, but at other entry and exit points of the SCB, it continues to be collected. It was also informed that toll collection has reduced by more than 30 per cent as the transport sector has been affected by lack of currency.",Hyderabad,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Demonetisation-SCB-realises-a-fifth-of-its-annual-revenue/article16661441.ece,HYDERABAD
2016-11-20 20:06:00,Demonetisation may hit fee reimbursement ," The present cash crunch and the huge projected decline in the State’s income in near future due to withdrawal of high-denomination notes may impact the fee reimbursement scheme in Telangana that is already in controversies over pending bills for the last two years. 
With Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao himself reportedly expecting a fall of Rs. 2,000 crore in the State’s revenue, college managements fear that the scheme may be hit badly. Their fears gain strength from the fact that the Government itself indicated the revenue shortfall, which will have a direct impact on welfare schemes. Apart from taxes from real the estate sector, the Government foresees taxes declining in excise, luxury and entertainment sector. 
The college managements say that the Government still owed them Rs. 2,050-odd crore and, after a few threats of closure, had released some amount, which was insufficient. In fact, Rs. 258 crore was released recently though the Government had promised Rs. 600 crore but the colleges say even that amount has not reached them. 
The Chief Minister also assured the managements, and later announced in the Assembly, that all dues would be cleared and the slate would be clean once the new academic year commenced. But not much progress had been made. 
In the backdrop of demonetisation, college managements met Deputy Chief Minister Kadiam Srihari and Power Minister. G. Jagadish Reddy on Saturday to seek an assurance. “We did appraise them of our fears and concerns and the Ministers assured us to do the best,” said Satish and Siddeshwar of the Degree Colleges Managements Association.
Fee reimbursement has not been on the priority list of the Government that has actually found several loopholes in the system and wanted to plug them. The series of inspections done by the universities first and by the Task Force, including policemen, later actually sent a signal to the colleges that the Government wanted to dilute it or at least make changes to escape the huge burden. 
Senior officials in the education department agree that revenue shortfall is imminent and fee reimbursement is definitely on the non-priority list of the Government. “Unless the Central Government supports the scheme it will certainly take a hit,” a senior official, unwilling to be quoted, said. 
College managements fear that if the payments are delayed, an additional Rs. 2500 crore would be added to the existing dues. The uncertainty over the impact of demonetisation is likely to hit the very survival of small and medium colleges in the rural sector as they totally depend on the Government’s support.

“While the earlier policy had these provisions the new one makes the provisions more effective,” he said. The expert recommended a 12 per cent tax rate across all commodities.

Addressing Congress workers at the birth centenary celebrations of the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the Nehru Maidan here, he said that demonetisation had worried only ordinary people and not those having black money.
“Are those who have been standing in queue in front of banks and ATMs are having black money? It is the common man who has been having sleepless nights and not those having black money,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.
The Chief Minister said that the Union government should have ensured that Rs. 100 and the new Rs. 500 notes were made available in enough numbers. “Now, many ordinary people, petty traders, and patients are suffering because of the non-availability of denomination of other currency in enough number.

2016-11-20 23:15:00,Demonetisation hits buffalo meat exporters,"With the demonetisation exercise severely hitting their operations, meat exporters have asked the government to lift curbs on cash withdrawal and related transactions to help them pay the traders as well as small and marginal farmers from whom they purchase buffaloes for slaughter.
The All India Meat & Livestock Exporters Association (AIMLEA), in a representation to the commerce ministry, complained that the withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 a week from the current account was not enough for these exporters to pay the entire chain of people – including traders (middlemen who purchase the buffaloes from farmers) and subsistence farmers - for the bovines, official sources said. They added that AIMLEA wants cash withdrawal and transaction curbs to be either done away with or eased. The commerce ministry has forwarded the representation to the finance ministry for further action. According to the AIMLEA, farmers who sell the bovines are mostly poor and without any bank account, and therefore, they are paid in cash, which they in turn use for activities including purchasing seeds and fertilisers and running their households. The buffalo meat sector in the country is largely unorganised. The regulators for the sector include the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority that falls under the commerce ministry’s jurisdiction as well as the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (under the health & family welfare ministry).
Similar complaints from exporters in other sectors, on the problems that they are facing due to the demonetisation policy, are being compiled, sources said, adding that the commerce ministry will soon hold discussions on the issue with representatives from various Export Promotion Councils. An August 2016 report by ICRA Ltd said, “Indian buffalo meat exports have grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29 per cent, from Rs.3,533 crore in FY08 to Rs.26,682 crore in FY16, enabling (the country) to overtake its close competitors Brazil and Australia to become the largest exporter of buffalo meat/beef, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of the world’s total buffalo meat/beef exports (in volume terms).”
Buffalo meat has been the highest agri-related export item from India for the past two consecutive years and its contribution to the total export revenues of India has almost doubled to 1.56 per cent in FY2016 from 0.76 per cent in FY2011, it said. ICRA said it estimated that buffalo meat export revenues will grow to about Rs.40,000 crore by FY21, at a CAGR of eight per cent. The Indian buffalo meat sector has boomed thanks to the buffalo population increasing to 108.7 million in 2012 (as per the 2012 all India livestock census) from 43.4 million in 1951.",Economy,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-buffalo-meat-exporters/article16669034.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-21 20:30:00,Mamata to take protest to States against demonetisation," Extending an invite to Opposition parties to join her protest against demonetisation, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced plans of rallies in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab on the issue in next few weeks. 
Ms. Banerjee would be in Delhi on November 23 and 24 and hold a rally at Lucknow on November 29 followed by events in Bihar on December 1 and 2 and also visit Punjab.
‘No personal interest’
“We are ready to join any political programme and anyone can join our programme. This is a movement of people. I have no personal interest in this,” she said. 
Her announcement came 72 hours after her deadline in Delhi that she would go for nationwide protests if the government did not withdraw demonetisation. 
In West Bengal, her party Trinamool Congress (TMC) had already announced plans of a State-wide protest on Wednesday. While she raised questions on the “hidden agenda” for demonetisation, she accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of threatening the opposition.
“The Prime Minister is threatening other parties who are raising their voices against demonetisation. PM should be sober. PM should behave like a PM. If necessary, he should convene an all-party meeting on the issue,” she said, adding that she would not be “cowed down by such threats.” 
“Don’t take it like an ego fight. Did we not support GST [Goods and Services Tax] for the interest of the country knowing that State earnings will drop,” Ms Banerjee said. 
CPI(M)’s charge 
Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) marched with the Chit Fund Sufferers Forum during the day and gave a deputation to Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi. 
“There is an understanding between the BJP and her [Ms. Banerjee] and she is there to destroy the rest of the Opposition. This is true for Bengal and now rest of the country is also understanding this,” CPI(M) State Secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said. Dr. Mishra said the Prime Minister had raised the chit fund issue in the past but nothing had been done in this regard.

“The Prime Minister is threatening other parties who are raising their voices on demonetisation. PM should be sober. PM should behave like a PM. If necessary, he should convene an all-party meeting on the issue,” Ms. Banerjee told a press conference at the state secretariat.
“There is no ego fight. There should be a plan of action on demonetisation. My humble submission is that let us work together to solve the issue. The people are suffering,” the Trinamool Congress supremo said.
Claiming that some political parties were unable to raise their voices because the “PM is threatening them”, she said, “But I will not be cowed down. I will continue to protest. He can put me in jail. He (Modi) is even threatening his own party.”
Mr. Modi at a rally in Agra yesterday said that political leaders behind multi-crore chit fund scams were attacking him because they had been hit hard by demonetisation, indirectly referring to Mamata Banerjee.
Alleging that there was a ‘scam’ behind this move, she said, “There must be some hidden agenda. What is the hidden agenda? Let them bring it to the public domain,” she said.
Ms. Banerjee said that she would hit the streets in Delhi on Tuesday and visit other states also on this issue.
“I will be in Delhi on November 23,24 and in Lucknow on November 29. I will also go to Bihar and Punjab,” she announced.
“This is not a political issue. We are speaking on behalf of commoners. Markets are closed. Small traders are hit,” she remarked and said “I have no personal interest. I am doing this for the sake of the people of the country“.

The Opposition asserted that no discussion on demonetisation would take place till the House mourns the nearly 70 deaths caused by hardships due to the withdrawal of higher denomination currency notes.
While Congress, BSP, TMC and CPI(M) among others wanted a resolution condoling the deaths to come from the Chair, Leader of the House and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley charged the Opposition of running away from the demonetisation debate.
Slogan-shouting opposition members rushed into the well of the House, forcing Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien to first adjourn the proceedings till 1130 hours and then again till noon.
“Why are they (opposition parties) running away from debate,” Jaitley asked. “This is clear now that the opposition is not ready for debate and is coming up with new excuses to disrupt the House.”
Stating that the notice for suspension of business under Rule 267 was accepted on first day of the winter session and a debate had started, he said the reported deaths could come up during the course of this debate and the reply to it.
No sooner that the House mourned the death of 130 persons in the derailment of Indore-Patna Express near Kanpur yesterday, Sitaram Yechury (CPI0-M) said an obituary reference condoling the death of 70 people due to hardships caused by the demonetisation should be moved by the Chair.
He was supported by Mayawati (BSP) who said people have died standing in queues because of hunger, want of medicines and waiting for currency for marriage.
Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad (Cong) said while condolences have been expressed for those killed in yesterday’s train accident, the same should be done for the 70 people who have lost their lives in last 15 days.
“They are also citizens of this country. We want such an obituary reference to come from the Chair,” he said, adding that Prime Minister Narenda Modi should also come to the House for the debate.
Kurien said if the members were ready, the discussion on demonetisation issue can resume immediately. “I would like to make it very clear that the Chair is ready for discussion if you are ready,” he said.
Stating that 11 bank employees were among the 70 who lost their lives, Yechury asked the Chair to take the opinion of the House on moving a resolution condoling their death. He said the debate could be held after the obituary reference is made by the Chair.
Kurien however virtually ruled it out saying “condolences are not done on demand. That has to come spontaneously. You can approach the Chairman (on that).”
To this, Yechury said “take consensus of the House”. At this point, opposition Congress, BSP and TMC members rushed into the Well shouting slogans.
“Narendra Modi sharam karo, sharam karo (shame on Narendra Modi)”, “Modi sadan mein jawab do (Modi please reply in the House)”, “poonjiwadio ki yeh sarkar nahi chalegi (this government of capitalists will not be tolerated)”, “Jan virodhi Narendra Modi sharma karo, sharam karo (shame on anti-people Narendra Modi),” they shouted.
TMC members carried placards with “Financial Emergency” written. Kurien then adjourned the proceedings till 1130 hours.

Second adjournment

No sooner did Deputy Chairman Kurien occupy the Chair and call Dilip Tirkey (BJD) to start his Zero Hour mention, Congress members trooped into the Well.
Kurien suggested that members could continue the discussion on demonetisation of currency, but Congress members kept shouting slogans and other opposition members were seen standing on the aisles.
Amid din, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi too pitched for continuation of the debate. “Many members want to speak (on the demonetisation),” he said.
Yechury (CPI-M) again asked the Chair for an obituary reference for those who died while standing in queues outside banks due to the demonetisation move.
Kurien said there is a procedure for such references and suggested that the members to approach Rajya Sabha Chairman.
“What is the authenticity of numbers (of dead) you are speaking,” he said, adding that obituary references cannot be taken up suo motu.
As Naqvi pressed for continuation of the debate on currency notes, the vociferous protests continued while BJP members kept shouting “We want discussion. We want discussion”. Kurien then adjourned the House till noon.

Third adjournment

As soon as House met at noon for the Question Hour, Opposition members again rose from their seats and started shouted slogans over demonetisation of currency.
Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari asked the members to let the Question Hour continue, but the Opposition did not relent.
Members including those from the Congress, TMC and BSP were seen standing along their seats with many of them shouting slogans.
Following the din in the House, Ansari adjourned the proceedings for the third time on Monday for 30 minutes.

2016-11-21 17:13:00,"Mamata targets Modi, to hit Delhi streets against demonetisation","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was threatening other parties raising voices against demonetisation. She would hit the streets of Delhi on Tuesday and visit other States also to protest against the Centre’s move which, she termed, was causing immense hardship to people.
“The Prime Minister is threatening other parties that are raising their voice on demonetisation. He should be sober. He should behave like a Prime Minister. If necessary, he should convene an all-party meeting on the issue,” Ms. Banerjee said at a press conference at the Secretariat.
“There is no ego fight. There should be a plan of action on demonetisation. My humble submission is that let us work together to solve the issue. The people are suffering,” the Trinamool Congress supremo said.
She claimed that some political parties were unable to raise their voices because the “Prime Minister is threatening them.” “But I will not be cowed down. I will continue to protest. He can put me in jail. He [Mr. Modi] is even threatening his own party.”
At a rally in Agra on Sunday, Mr. Modi said political leaders behind multi-crore chit fund scams were attacking him because they were hit hard by demonetisation, indirectly referring to Ms. Banerjee.
Ms. Banerjee alleged that there was a ‘scam’ behind this move. “There must be some hidden agenda. What is the hidden agenda? Let them bring it to the public domain.” 
“I will be in Lucknow on November 29. I will also go to Bihar and Punjab,” she announced.
“This is not a political issue. We are speaking on behalf of commoners. Markets are closed. Small traders are hit. I have no personal interest. I am doing this for the sake of the people of the country,“ she observed.
She said that she was not alone in her fight and added that at least three other parties had gone with her to the President.
“I will request all [Opposition] political parties to be with the people”, she said.

2016-11-21 18:41:00,Demonetisation hits farm sector hard,"ONGOLE: Demonetisation has come at an inopportunate time for the farming community as November is the month when khariff crop harvest picks up pace, coinciding with the sowing of rabi crop in Prakasam district.
Farm sector is among the worst-affected with farmers badly in need of cash to complete the harvest of khariff crops saved against odds in view of drought and start sowing of the winter crops like Bengal gram and tobacco. 
Thanks to tight liquidity position, the price of vegetables and other crops are falling. 
Cotton growers are in an unenvious position with the price of white gold crashing to about Rs. 4,100 per quintal in the market from about Rs. 5,600 per quintal in the pre-demonetisation period. 
“Adding to our woes, the traders are asking us to accept payments in scrapped notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000,” says a group of cotton growers from Inkollur who have deferred plucking hoping that the cash crunch will ease in the next one week to 10 days. They welcomed the Centre’s decision to allow scrapped notes for purchase of seed and fertilisers during the rabi season.
The monetary crisis has brought to the fore the resilience of the farming community in the post-demonetisation phase. Farmers, who have been hitherto used to cash transactions mostly, are exploring all ways to stay afloat and undergo pain in the fond hope that better days will come. 
“No doubt, we are facing severe cash crunch. We will bear it as the nation will be benefited in the long run as a result of weeding out of black money and counterfeit notes,” says a farmer leader, Jagarlamudi Anil Babu, from the rice-rich Karamchedu village. With only Rs. 2,000 notes made available in banks, there is a huge shortage of notes in Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denomination needed to make payments to farm workers and purchase of farm inputs. “We have found a solution to the persistent problem by deferring payments to farm workers and paying partly in the form of rice,” he says.
“We have started paying the workers partly in the form of rice and stand guarantee to small loans extended to them by the local grocery shops to buy other essential commodities,” says Palaparthi Srinivasa Rao, a farmer from Nagulapupadu. The trust they enjoy with suppliers of farm inputs have ensured uninterrupted supply of pesticides to their farms on credit. 
“The fertiliser dealers also oblige us by accepting scrapped Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes,” says another farmer, G.Veeraragavalu from Chadalavada.
“With no access to institutional credit, tenant farmers, who are mainly depend upon private money lenders, faced difficulty in raising capital for the rabi crop,” says Kuvulu Rythu Sangam State secretary N. Ranga Rao.
The farmers needed about Rs. 3,200 crore in cash, particularly lower denomination of Rs. 50 and Rs. 100 notes to pay farm workers and complete the harvest of khariff crop in about 40 lakh hectares in the State without any hassles, according to YSRC farmers’ wing State president N.V.S. Nagi Reddy. He wants the Central and State governments to release crop loans sanctioned for growers on a top priority basis to go for Bengal gram and other crops in 25 lakh hectares during the rabi season.

2016-11-21 18:33:00,Vadde faults Centreon demonetisation ,"VIJAYAWADA: Former minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao on Monday asked the Centre not to discriminate the co-operative banking sector in the demonetisation drive and suggested bringing in rules that govern the commercial banks as far as the availability of the money was concerned.
Speaking to the media persons, he said the co-operative banking sector was the worst-hit as the availability of money made was less. “Co-operative banking sector is the backbone of the rural India and the Banking Regulation Act that govern the commerical banks is applicable to it. Now that the khariff season has ended, the farmers have no money to give to the farm hands. To raise the second crop they have no money to buy seed, pesticides and fertilizers,” he said.
He blamed the Centre for its ham-handed executing of demonetisation exercise and felt that more number of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 notes must have been available to the public. “Releasing Rs. 2,000 is a big mistake. No one is giving change for Rs. 2,000 and for the past 12 days people across India are suffering. The badly hit are those in the lower section of the society,” he said.
He felt corruption cannot be stopped even after the initiative. “It is an open secret that in all public works and projects, kickbacks up to 5 and 7 per cent were being paid.” Citing an example at Amaravati, he said while per acre at the capital city was around Rs. 4 crore, the government was doling out land for the corporate sector for a paltry Rs. 50 lakh.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Vadde-faults-Centreon-demonetisation/article16671201.ece,
2016-11-21 00:08:00,Farmers of Malnad region grappling with after effects of demonetisation," With paucity of cash to pay labourers for harvesting work and the decline in the price of agriculture produce, farmers in rural areas of Malnad region are grappling with the after effects of demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes.
It may be mentioned here that immediately after the announcement of demonetisation, the prices of arecanut registered a slump by around 10 percent in the Shivamogga market. Arecanut trading had come to a standstill from November 10 to 17. Though the trading of arecanut has resumed, no improvement in the price can be seen.
Decline in yield
There was decline in the yield of arecanut in the region this year owing to moisture stress caused by drought prevalent from the past two years. 
Tirthappa, a farmer from Holalur village near here, said that arecanut prices were expected to escalate owing to a decline in the yield. It is unfortunate that owing to demonetisation, there has been sharp decline in the price. The decline is attributed to confusion at multiple levels, including at firms engaged in making products from arecanut and owners of local mandis, on making payments for purchases following demonetisation.
Maize and paddy 
Not only arecanut, the prices of maize and paddy have also declined owing to demonetisation. The centres involved in procuring paddy have not yet commenced functioning in the district. The price of paddy that was at Rs. 1,600 per quintal and had declined to around Rs 1,500 after demonetisation. The price of maize has fallen to around Rs. 1,310 from Rs. 1,400 per quintal. 
Yogish, a farmer from Anavatti village said that middlemen, who purchase produce from the doorsteps of farmers, are citing paucity of cash as the reason for the decline in the price. He said that the government should immediately commence the procurement of agriculture produce at minimum support price to arrest the decline in the prices.
Tankachan Andrews, who is engaged in integrated farming in Ripponpet village near here, said that he had postponed the work of harvesting arecanut, ginger and tapping trees at his rubber plantation owing to the non-availability of cash to pay wages to labourers. Agricultural activities have faced serious setbacks owing to the restrictions on withdrawal of cash from banks.
Banana
Mr. Andrews said that he had even postponed the work of providing additional an dose of fertiliser to his banana plants. The shops engaged in selling agricultural inputs are not accepting demonetised currency. The delay in providing additional dosage of fertiliser will affect the yield of banana. 
Withdrawal limits 
In the wake of commencement of harvesting activities, farmers should be exempted from the weekly withdrawal limits of Rs. 24,000 from savings accounts, he said.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Farmers-of-Malnad-region-grappling-with-after-effects-of-demonetisation/article16661730.ece,Shivamogga
2016-11-21 00:04:00,Farming community struggling to cope with demonetisation in Hassan," The withdrawal of high denomination notes has severely affected cash flow in the district, leaving the farming community in dire straits. Farmers, who already marketed their kharif harvest, cannot spend the cash they have earned to prepare the ground for rabi cultivation, while the rest are not finding traders to purchase their produce.
Many ginger growers have left their produce on the farmland, waiting to sell at a suitable price. Similarly, maize growers have delayed the harvest hoping that the situation will get better soon. 
Steep fall in price
Rajaiah, of Boovanahalli in Hassan taluk, has cultivated maize. “No merchants are buying maize as they do not have cash. Besides this, the price has also come down in the market as there is no cash flow. After the demonetisation came into effect, the price of maize came down by Rs. 1,700 to Rs. 1,350 per quintal, within a few days,” he said.
Harvest postoned
Similar is the case of ginger growers. Many of them have decided to leave the yield in the field for some more time, hoping that the situation will improve soon. Lakshman, of Shantigrama village, has grown ginger in his two-acre farm. The yield is ready for harvest, but he has delayed it. “The price of ginger has come down in the last eight days from Rs.1,200 per bag to Rs.900 per bag of 62 kgs,” he said.
The delay in harvest will have adverse effects. Kanagal Murthy, a maize grower at Dodda Kanagal in Alur taluk, said even if it rained for a day, the standing crop would go waste. Like him, many are finding it difficult to arrange for labourers for harvest as there is no cash on hand to pay them. The farmers who delay the harvest of ginger also face the loss, as tubers become dry and lose weight. “I have been providing sufficient water to the ginger tubers so that weight is not lost,” said Lakshman. However, not every ginger grower can afford the luxury of watering the tubers for a long period.
The farmers, who sold their products early, are not getting cash for household expenses or for preparations for rabi cultivation. They have had to deposit cash in their accounts as they had received cash in the old currency.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Farming-community-struggling-to-cope-with-demonetisation-in-Hassan/article16661684.ece,Hassan

To get back whatever they had invested on the crop, growers with small land holdings have started direct sale of their produce along the main roads, highways, hobli headquarters, and towns. Such scenes are becoming common, especially on the outskirts of Mysuru, with the produce being carried in goods vehicles to reach out to buyers.
Beans, tomato, brinjal, cabbage and other major vegetables are prominently sold and offered at a price less than the market price. “Growers have no other option but to go for direct marketing ... otherwise the crop will rot with not many traders coming forward to buy the produce,” a farmer leader said.

As in most of the estates, their family gets a weekly advance of Rs. 1,200 and a salary at the end of the month. “We have not been paid the advance for the last two weeks in cash,” Anand told The Hindu.
The estate manager informed the workers that the advance of Rs. 1,200 had been credited to their bank accounts (Jan Dhan accounts). “When I went to the bank, I was told that as only Rs.1,200 was in the account, I could not withdraw it. The officials at the bank said they did not have smaller currency to give us Rs.1,200. I need to withdraw a minimum of Rs. 2,000. For this, I will have to wait for one more week,” he said.
For the last two weeks, Anand, who has two children, has received no payment. This is situation hundreds of workers in the estates are facing.

2016-11-21 19:56:00,LDF announces 24 hour stir against cooperative crisis created by demonetisation,"Thiruvananthapuram, Nov 21:
The Left Democratic Front has decided to broad base its agitation against the attempts to undermine Kerala’s vibrant cooperative sector under the pretext of demonetisation by organising a day and night demonstrations at the local bodies’ level on November 24 and 25. The agitation will begin at 10 am on November 24 and end at 10 am the next day.
In a statement here, LDF convenor Vaikkom Vishwan said the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party were trying to strangle Kerala’s cooperative sector which has been a life line of the people of Kerala. The LDF’s stand is to organise a general platform of protest cutting across political affiliation. It wanted all persons active in the cooperative sector to stand united in the attempts to save it.
Mr. Vishwan said the Centre had failed to solve the difficulties faced by the people as a result of the demonetisation of the high value currency notes. The crisis became acute because sufficient precautionary steps were not taken prior to withdrawing the notes from circulation. He alleged that the attempts to undermine the cooperative sector was pre-planned . The sector had been able to attract the trust of people and attempt was to destroy this by creating panic situation.
The CPI(M) state secretariat issued a statement expressing solidarity with the day and night agitation called by the LDF. It said that the entire state, irrespective of politial affiliation, was opposed to the moves to undermine the cooperative sector. It wanted all other political parrites to cooperate with the LDF’s agitation and convert into an unanimous voice against the Cetnre’s decision.
The CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran issued a statement extending his party’s full support to the LDF agitation against the Centre’s attempt to paralyse the rural economy of the State.

2016-11-21 00:00:00,Business at weekly ‘santhais’ in rural areas hit due to demonetisation,"The normal business at the weekly ‘santhais’ in the rural areas in the districts of Salem and Namakkal remained crippled for the second consecutive week, thanks to the shortage of lower denomination currency. The ‘santhais’ used to be overflowing with traders, mainly the farmers, and consumers from across the districts every week.
The weekly cattle ‘santhais’ in these two districts which attract a large number of traders from the neighbouring states of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have also been affected.
The ‘santhai’ at Konganapuram near Edappadi, which meets on Saturdays, is a major cattle market of the western region. Every week, about 5,000 goats are brought here from the surrounding villages and all were sold out instantly for good price.
On Saturday, only 2,000 goats were in the market and they too were quoted very lesser price compared to the previous occasions. “The present scenario is something unprecedented which we have not witnessed in the last many decades”, laments S. Marisamy, a 65-year-old farmer of Konganapuram.
The Sinna Tirupathi weekly ‘santhai,’ about 20 km from Omalur town, is another major market of the district. The market which met on Saturday did not attract many consumers.
The farmers who had brought the cattle in the morning left in huff within a couple of hours with the cattle, due to the absence of any trader to purchase them.
“We have not witnessed such a poor scenario in the ‘santhai’ in many years. This is something peculiar. It will take a long time for the normal situation to return”, says Pakkiam, who had put up a vegetable stall in the ‘santhai’. Taramangalam ‘santhai’ near Salem city which met on Thursdays is another major weekly market. The traders complain that there were no takers even for the regular grocery items and vegetables, which were not very costly.
Similar is the case in other weekly markets too in Salem and Namakkal districts.
The business and the weekly auctions of copra, plantain, cotton, turmeric, too have been affected due to shortage of currency with the trading community.
The copra auction at Paramathivelur regulated market was cancelled for the past two weeks, due to poor traders turn up.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Business-at-weekly-%E2%80%98santhais%E2%80%99-in-rural-areas-hit-due-to-demonetisation/article16670052.ece,SALEM
2016-11-21 00:00:00,"Demonetisation is to divert dissent of the public, says Ramakrishnan","CPI (M) state secretary G. Ramakrishnan has said that the demonetisation exercise in its present form was not genuinely aimed at eradicating black money but only to divert the overall dissent of people on Union Government.
“Considering the apparent hardships faced by the common man, the authorities should allow to use the now withdrawn Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 as legal tenders till December 30 before phasing them out.
“The buffer period could be utilised to inject adequate replacement currencies into the system. At the same time, all other scrutiny procedures meant for monitoring of any unaccounted money flowing into the system can be continued up to December 30,” he told reporters here on Sunday.
On why he felt that the present measures will not wipe out entire black money, Mr. Ramakrishnan claimed that according to the authentic studies, only six per cent of the black money generated in the country was stored in cash. “The remaining 94 per cent have been either stashed in banks abroad or invested in properties, gold, equities and other investment destinations. Similarly, the issue of counterfeit notes is also not at any worrisome levels to warrant any demonetisation exercise of the kind. A report of Indian Statistical Institute says that counterfeit notes comes to only 0.025 per cent of the legal currencies in circulation,” he contended.
The CPI (M) leader wondered why the Union Government opted for such an exercise when it is not even listed among the eight steps suggested by the special investigation team (SIT) constituted for tackling black money.
He asked why the Union Government, which shows much concern about wiping out black money, has waived off loans given to the corporate houses to the tune of Rs. 1,12,000 crore during 2014-15 fiscal.
On the sufferings of the agrarian community due to the monetary curbs imposed on co-operative sector credit institutions post-monetisation, Mr. Ramakrishnan pointed out that agrarian community in the State had plunged into a predicament as they obtain nearly Rs 6,000 crore worth agriculture loans from these institutions.

“I never came across a crisis that could not be solved for so many days in my entire political career,” he said in a teleconference with officials and bankers from his residence here.
The State government could tide over the Hudhud cyclone impact and restore normalcy in just eight days. It was on high alert following a setback on the first day of the Godavari pushkarams ensuring the event went off smoothly thereafter. It was unfortunate the problems of demonetisation had remained unsolved even after 12days, he said.
“I myself feel impatient over the predicament. Despite all hardships, the people are exhibiting patience and endurance. Really, we need to appreciate it.” The bankers and the finance department officials should get up and go. “It is time the people got their much needed relief from cash crunch.”

It was time to meet the expectations of the public and work overcoming rules and regulations, he said. “Address every complaint received at the command control room.”

2016-11-21 00:55:00,Demonetisation badly implemented: Jogi,"RAIPUR: Former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister and Chhattisgarh Janata Congress (CJC) chief Ajit Jogi on Sunday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the ‘badly-implemented’ decision of demonetisation.
“The PM thought that he will go down in the history as someone who got rid of black money. But now he will go down in the history as someone who was not fit to be the Prime Minister of the country, and who did not realise the meaning of demonetisation,” Mr. Jogi, who is now wheelchair-bound, told The Hindu.
He also said the decision of demonetising the now outdated Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 currency notes was taken with an eye on upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
“The objective [of demonetisation] could have been achieved by planning its implementation in a better manner. When they [Bharatiya Janata Party] realised that they could not recover the NPAs [Non Performing Assets] from industrialists, they thought that they would recover it from the common public. You have restricted co-operative banks from changing notes. It is becoming difficult for farmers and common people in the rural area to manage the day to day life,” Mr. Jogi claimed.
He also said that the move would damage the BJP in the upcoming elections.
“ The common public will find it difficult to forget this as they had to stand in queues for hours [to get] their own money. There is hardly any way to deal with it apart from a partial rollback or some concessions, at least in rural areas, ” he added.
Tribal deaths in Bastar
When asked about the current situation in Bastar region of Chhattisgarh and the alleged extra-judicial killings of tribals, Mr. Jogi said the controversial officer, under whose watch the alleged excesses are happening, was “once very close to him.”
“Even Narendra Modi and [Chhattisgarh] Chief Minister Raman Singh have no control over the administration in Bastar. The majority of the encounters are false and fake, and 75 per cent of those who are surrendering as Maoists are common people. If this continues, we will never be able to get rid of Maoist insurgency in Bastar. I always believe that there will be officers who will go their own way if the political leadership fails to control them; the government’s approach [in Bastar] is totally wrong,” Mr. Jogi told The Hindu.",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Demonetisation-badly-implemented-Jogi/article16662085.ece,

2016-11-21 00:00:00,Capital’s scrap market feels the heat of demonetisation,"The little space outside Alam’s shanty, where he would relax after a long day of collecting household waste from door-to-door, is dotted with empty plastic bottles and metallic scrap.
These heaps of plastic waste are only getting bigger with each passing day, as are the lines on Alam’s forehead. After repeatedly trying to call someone, the 20-year-old turns to his mother and says, “Phone abhi bhi band hai [the mobile phone is still switched off].”

Shutting shop

Most shops that deal in scrap near Seemapuri slums in north-east Delhi, which is where Alam lives with his family, have shut shop since Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 currency notes.
The reason being that the scrap dealers have no change to pay for the waste plastic they buy from garbage collectors.

Caught off-guard

“The few shops that are open are buying it for half the price and forcing us to accept old notes. What do we do with these notes?” said Alam, the youngest of five siblings.
The news of demonetisation took Alam and his family by surprise. Their immediate worry was the few thousand rupees they had saved over the past few years.
A day after the announcement, Alam was among those who lined up outside a bank with Rs.10,000 in his pocket.
“There was a huge rush. Like hundreds others, I skipped work and stood in a line to exchange the old notes. My turn didn’t come. I went again the next day and waited several hours, only to be told that I couldn’t get Rs.10,000 exchanged, and that I would have to deposit the money instead. I came back empty-handed as I don’t have an account,” he said.
So demoralised were Alam and his family that they joined their neighbours in an impromptu protest.
Reality, however, dawned on Alam the next day when he required the new currency to take care of his family’s daily expenses. His family includes two differently-abled nephews.
Alam then met a bank employee, who told him that he could get Rs.4,000 exchanged at a time.
“I reached the bank with a blanket at 8 p.m. and slept in the queue with several others. Next morning, I managed to get two Rs.2,000 notes,” he said with a smile.

Short-lived joy

But his happiness was short-lived. He was in for a shock when he reached the market the next day.
“The shopkeepers refused to accept the new currency. They claimed not to have change. Ultimately, I had to buy a big sack of rice worth Rs.1,000 and get some grocery from another shop. Thankfully, I now have a few Rs.100 notes,” he said.

The board raked in over Rs. 6 crore, largely in property tax, after it decided to accept payments in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. The SCB began accepting the demonetised currency on November 11. Officials say that they expect more revenue in the coming days.
“A large chunk of the payments are from those who had not paid earlier. After an initial dilemma over whether the old notes should be accepted or not, we began the collections,” informed an SCB official.
SCB’s revenue collection has increased in the recent years, mainly through revision of property tax rates and stringent collection norms. However, the collection has remained well below Rs. 50 crore, though talk of a potential Rs. 100 crore collection is common. With four more days to go before the deadline for acceptance of old notes elapses, taxmen are hopeful of more revenue collection.
The SCB’s collection of toll tax at the entry and exit points is now being questioned as the Centre has exempted toll payment till November 24. A former ward member, Jai Prakash, made a representation to the SCB asking for exemption.
When contacted, an SCB official, on condition of anonymity, said the toll collection was exempted on the highway, but at other entry and exit points of the SCB, it continues to be collected. It was also informed that toll collection has reduced by more than 30 per cent as the transport sector has been affected by lack of currency.",Hyderabad,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Demonetisation-SCB-realises-a-fifth-of-its-annual-revenue/article16670275.ece,HYDERABAD

2016-11-21 18:50:00,Demonetisation may hit labour-intensive export sector output,"Worried that the demonetisation exercise may hit the output of India's labour-intensive export sectors in the short-term, the commerce ministry on Monday said it will take up with the finance ministry a proposal to enhance the weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account for these exporters.
This followed various Export Promotion Councils (EPC) informing the commerce ministry that the demonetisation policy has resulted in difficulties in disbursing wages to seasonal & migrant workers in labour-intensive sectors such as agriculture, carpet, handicrafts, handloom, leather, textiles and engineering, in addition to problems in cash payment to truckers & their support-staff.
These EPCs wanted the government to raise the weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 to as high as Rs 5 lakh. However, the apex exporters’ body -- the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) -- told the commerce ministry that the withdrawal limit may be increased from Rs 50,000 per week to a monthly limit of one per cent of the previous year's turnover of each company/firm. “The said (higher) limit can easily be operated by the banks as they have access to the balance sheet and turnover details of each firm/company. The supply of smaller denomination notes may also be increased,” FIEO said.
After holding a meeting with EPCs that lasted for over an hour, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that she will soon take up with the finance ministry the demands put forward by labour-intensive export sectors to raise the weekly cash withdrawal ceiling of Rs 50,000 from the current account.
Sectors such as handloom, handicrafts, textiles and carpet employ a large number of seasonal and migrant workers who do not have a bank account, and therefore, their wages are paid in cash, she said, adding that even engineering sector firms procure some inputs such as scrap metal from people in the informal/unorganised sector and without bank accounts.
Citing the difficulties due to the government's surprise move to withdraw the legal tender status of high-value currency notes in the denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 from the midnight of November 8, these labour-intensive export sectors said they will be reducing their production capacity by as much as 40 per cent in the short-term, which in turn will lead to a lower output. “We have assured the exporters that we will soon send our report to the finance ministry so that quick remedial measures can be taken,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

Economic losses

However, the minister said so far no one has quantified the economic losses incurred by the export sectors due to the demonetisation exercise. She added that the impact is unlikely to last beyond a fortnight as the government is speeding up the process of ensuring cash at the ATMs as well as taking other necessary remedial measures such as lower denomination notes.
Ravi Sehgal, Senior Vice Chairman of the apex engineering exporters’ body EEPC India, said: “This (weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000) is inadequate and is affecting most of the small and medium scale units. Some companies have a weekly system of wages where workers seek payment in cash. Though the workers have bank accounts, they are unwilling to accept direct payment to their banks largely because if the amount exceeds Rs. 50,000 this would lead them to forfeit their subsidy benefits for below poverty line (BPL) account.” Besides, with the transport sector being affected by demonetisation, the movement of export cargo has been hit, Mr Sehgal said.
According to the FIEO, the demonetisation policy may lead to the economy slowing down particularly in the sectors primarily dealing in cash, but it would be a course correction for larger inclusive growth and greater push to Indian economy in the long-term. “For micro and small companies and those dealing with unorganised sector, payment of wages to workers is currently a challenge as the workers are not keen to take the wages through cheque. Many of them coming from distant areas may not have bank account at their place of work. Those exporters procuring in small quantities like fruits & vegetables from farmers or handicraft from artisans or sending goods for job work, are also reporting the same problem,” the FIEO said.

The TTD temple in Chennai has received Rs. 2.13 crore, the highest ever cash offering from devotees in a short span of 18 days from Novermber 1. The hundi collections included foreign currency, gold and silver, the quantum of which is being valued.
“The usual hundi collection in the Chennai temple is between Rs. 80 lakh to Rs. 1 crore per month. But the offerings crossed Rs. 2 crore in just 18 days. The same trend is happening at Tirumala, the abode of Lord Venkateswara,” TTD Board Member J. Sekhar told The Hindu’ on Sunday.

2016-11-21 00:00:00,Fuel outlet employees too face demonetisation heat,"Like bank employees, fuel outlet attendants too have had a harrowing time these past few days since people come to them with notes of large denominations. Many of them said their patience was exhausted talking to customers who were often rude in their demand for change.
“Most of the middle class customers have exhausted their Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and are bringing in Rs. 2,000 notes. If they tank up for Rs. 1,000, we are forced to give them Rs. 1,000 in change and that would mean ten notes of Rs. 100, which is just not possible,” said a fuel pump attendant.
Fuel outlet managers said they were not getting enough change from banks though they knew their sales volume was high. “We easily require around Rs. 30,000 in notes of Rs. 100 a day. But we get notes for only Rs. 5,000-Rs. 6,000 and that too from other customers. Some people wait for a few minutes so that we can get Rs. 100 notes when others pay. But some others just refuse to wait and they also don’t tell us they have only notes of higher denominations. We cannot take back the petrol just because we don’t have change,” said an outlet manager.
Added to this is the recent announcement that cash can be withdrawn using electronic data capturing machines. These are outlets that are linked with State Bank of India accounts and debit cards can be used. However, customers do not realise that only a few outlets have such facilities.
“On Saturday, we had a tough time telling people they can’t withdraw cash at our outlet since we don’t bank with SBI. What we do at present is withdraw cash from our current account by cheque and the amount gets credited to our account the next day.

2016-11-21 01:02:00,Economy demonetised,"Though the apex Court has gone slightly overboard in saying that there may be riots if the present suffering caused by the government’s demonetisation move goes on, the anguish and apprehension of the honourable judges is understandable (“People are affected, there may be riots: Supreme Court,” Nov. 18). It is clear that the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demonetise the old Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes, though bold, historic and well-intended, was hasty and taken without contemplating its short-term implications, especially on the poor and the downtrodden.
When 86 per cent of the notes in circulation were about to be sucked out, was it not the responsibility of the powers-that-be to make alternate prior arrangements?
Further, any banker in the know of things would vouch for the fact that the statements of the government and the RBI that adequate supplies of alternate cash/currency have been made to meet the demand are wrong and misleading. It is clear that most of the bank branches and currency chests have not received the new notes or notes of smaller denominations. Instead the RBI has given instructions to re-circulate old, soiled and damaged notes. The government’s decision to send teams to different States for a spot assessment is belated and doesn’t serve any purpose as the officials constituting those teams cannot be expected to give any realistic, impartial and independent report.

B. Harish,


Mangaluru

It was very thoughtful of The Hindu to have covered a day in the life of a bank (”Drowning in illiquidity: A day in the life of bank,” Nov. 20). There is no gainsaying that bank branches across the country have been standing up to the task of handling the shortage of cash, in the wake of the demonetisation move, to mitigate the resultant inconvenience caused to the public. Incidentally, it has given banks a great opportunity to touch people belonging to different walks of life. They should use this chance to refurbish their oft-maligned and derided customer service.

C.G. Kuriakose,


Kothamangalam

The recent claim by our Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, regarding the demonetisation move as one having been executed after comprehensive planning, lacks genuineness, given the arbitrary changes with regard to the exchange cap on the old denomination notes. The Indian public needs to be lauded for putting up with the hardships and coming up with a plethora of impromptu measures.

2016-11-21 20:48:00,Those against demonetisation are anti-nationals: Fadnavis,"MUMBAI: Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis at an election rally in Ratnagiri town of Konkan on Sunday termed the opponents of demonetisation as anti-nationals.
“The decision of demonetisation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is historic. Freedom fighters sacrificed their lives to make India independent. Those who are supporting demonetisation are freedom fighters for economic independence...There are people who are opposing the move. They are nothing but anti-nationals,” said Mr. Fadnavis.
The CM went on to compare the plight of citizens facing the cash crunch to the Army jawans. “Our jawans stand at the border to protect the country. They do not have any personal animosity with Pakistan. If they can do it, can’t you suffer for 50 days for the country’s benefit?”
Reacting to his comments, the Congress said declaring the opposition as anti-national is nothing but an attempt to shift the democratic country towards dictatorship. “For the last two years, the Sangh parivar and the BJP have been playing the game of patriotism. All those who are talking against Mr. Modi are being termed anti-nationals. Protesting the irresponsible government and lousy bureaucracy cannot be anti-national,” said party spokesperson Sachin Sawant.
He said the government has taken the decision without proper homework and adequate measures. “The actual black money hoarders are out in the open, but common citizens are standing in queues to withdraw their honestly-earned money.”",Mumbai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Those-against-demonetisation-are-anti-nationals-Fadnavis/article16671677.ece,

On Sunday, a delegation of traders held a meeting with Mr. Thackeray to explain hardships being faced by the trading community. “Not only your generation, but even the next generation is going to suffer from this decision. Are you going to remain silent? Do not sit idle and shed tears. Be prepared to fight against this autocratic decision,” Mr. Thackeray said.
“He (Narendra Modi) was elected by the country’s 125-crore population, which was disillusioned with Congress rule. This population should have been taken into confidence before any such decision,” he said.
Earlier, a delegation of traders held a meeting with the Sena chief, where he was informed that the trading business has taken a 70-per cent hit due to demonetisation. “Our business has come to a complete standstill. November and December are usually the best profit- making months for us, but demonetisation has completely changed the picture,” Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said after meeting. He added that the association has conveyed its problems to the Prime Minister in the past. “The government has taken the decision without adequate homework,” he said.
Biren Lambichiya, another officer bearer of the association said that retail traders helped Mr Modi to achieve power. “But now he is taking steps against us,” he said.

Customers were greeted by ‘not working’ boards at many of the ATMs, some ATMs downed their shutters, while others witnessed long queues.
Long queues were seen at the ATMs of SBI at Dwaraka Nagar and Rednam Gardens on Sunday. The HDFC Bank ATM at Dwarakanagar also witnessed long line of customers while the ICICI ATMs at Madhavadhara and Dwarakanagar downed shutters. People were seen trying to exchange their Old High Denomination (OHD) notes at fuel stations.
Small traders, fish vendors and the general public continued to face problems even after 12 days of the government’s decision on big notes.
“Motorists have stopped coming for repairs unless they feel it absolutely important to go for immediate repairs. Some are bringing old Rs.500 notes for repairs costing Rs.100 or so and we cannot give them change,” said Tata Rao, a motorcycle mechanic, who has his shop beside Sankar Matham.
“We are telling customers that if they give Rs.2000 note, the bill should be at least Rs.1600 or more. Our cash transactions dropped by around 50 per cent. On the positive side, however, we have noticed a quantum jump in card transactions,” said an employee of a restaurant near Diamond Park.

“We have been making endless visits to the ATMs from the past couple of days, but at most places there’s no cash. In fact, we took out Rs. 10,000 in the denominations of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 just the day the demonetisation news broke. Now, we are stuck with several notes which are useless,” said Rebecca Honeycone from Canterbury, a cathedral city in southeast England.
Rebecca is in Visakhapatnam with her husband Phillip to cheer the England cricket team as part of her India tour itinerary which began from October this year.
“Our everyday expenses have escalated way beyond what we planned. We had to upgrade from homestays to bigger hotels which accept credit cards. If we go to see any tourist monument, the fee for a foreign tourist is Rs. 500 but nobody is accepting the Rs. 500 notes as a result we had to skip several such tourist places because we are guarding whatever little lower denomination notes we are left with for emergency needs,” said Phillip, her husband.
“Some banks refused to entertain us as we are foreigners. Tomorrow we head to Hyderabad and there again will begin a next chapter for the hunt of Rs. 100 notes!” quipped Rebecca.
There are hundreds of England cricket fans, who currently in Visakhapatnam and on an India tour, including the organised cricket fan groups like the Barmy Army that are often termed as the England team’s unofficial 12th man. Most of them said that they were facing problems as they mostly have the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes or are given Rs. 2,000 notes at airport forex counters.
In Visakhapatnam, like in many other Indian cities, majority of ATMs are still not functioning properly.
Oliver Terry from Nottingham, England, who was enjoying the cricket match on Sunday with several other England fans said: “Hotels and bars are the only places where we are finding change for Rs. 2,000 notes. We are buying beer cans and food collectively as a group for a high value bill. We have also noticed that most of the local vendors and stores are not willing to part with change.”
“If we want to go out and see some tourist place, we cannot go as the taxi driver or autorickshaws are demanding new currency notes or money in lower denomination ,” said John, another England cricket fan.
Andrew Gosden from Lymington Hampshire said that this time he may have to disappoint his friends and family members back home as he doesn’t have enough lower denomination currencies to purchase souvenirs. “It is Christmas season for us and obviously my family will be eagerly waiting for me to get them some Indian souvenirs. But I am finding it tough to get change for the souvenirs in the local shops in cities,” he added.

2016-11-22 04:37:00,," As India grapples with the implications of demonetisation, many Sri Lankans are watching it keenly. Not just those planning a trip across the Palk Bay but also others who remember a similar exercise undertaken by the Sri Lankan government in the early 1970s to declare 50 and 100 rupee notes illegal tender. 
It was the initiative of N.M. Perera, a renowned Left politician who was then Finance Minister. The Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) he led was in the coalition government, led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
The LSSP’s current leader, Tissa Vitharana, said the initiative came when there was evidence that large amounts of money had been out of the banking system. “There was a feeling that people had not declared their wealth for taxation,” said Mr. Vitharana, who served as a Cabinet Minister in the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
Unique exercise
Many economists have deemed the exercise unique in Sri Lanka’s monetary history. 
“In the process, the details of the owner were passed on to the Department of Inland Revenue. With this information, it was possible to rope in additional sums of tax,” wrote economist Saman Kelegama, in his commentary on N.M. Perera’s Policies and Achievements as Finance Minister, a book authored by senior academic Buddhadasa Hewavitharana.
“There was not as much chaos as there seems to be in India now,” said former cricket administrator and businessman Chandra Shaffter, who was on a visit to India, when The Hindu contacted him. “At that time in Sri Lanka, ordinary citizens were not inconvenienced, only the rich who had hoarded money complained,” he recalled. 
According to W.D. Lakshman, economist and former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo, the exercise brought a substantial amount back into the banking sector and helped maintain a healthy tax-to-GDP ratio. “It was a very innovative attempt. N.M. Perera had a long history of activism,” he said. 
“Ordinary people responded positively, while the upper middle class, particularly those who had kept money hoarded, had an issue,” Prof. Lakshman said. It was, some observed, part of a general resentment at the Leftist leader whom the wealthier classes saw as bad for business. Not very long after, Prime Minister J.R. Jayawardene, who won a massive mandate in the next general election, liberalised the economy in 1977.
The positive response of the ordinary citizens was also to do with the strong banking sector in the early 1970s, Prof. Lakshman said
The move hurt only those who had a lot of cash on hand, not others, said Devanesan Nesiah, a civil servant at that time. . ",,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Sri-Lanka%E2%80%99s-demonetisation-pinched-only-the-rich/article16674578.ece,COLOMBO

Harvesting of two freshwater fish species – rohu and catla – had to be postponed in over one lakh hectares of aqua ponds in Krishna district and in the areas of its neighbouring West Godavari district. Rohu and catla are the most economically important fish species which are cultivated in Krishna district. Above 80 per cent of the production of freshwater fish species is being exported to Kolkata and Odisha states. “Price of rohu and catla at the domestic market has fallen drastically owning to the impact of demonetisation. The price fall of the two species this year is 20 per cent when compared to the last season,” Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture senior scientist B. Seshagiri has told The Hindu. 
However, Mr. Seshagiri has opined that the impact of the demonetisation will be less on those who could manage the expenditure to postpone the harvesting of the fish. Ironically, farmers of Kaikaluru, Mandavalli and other areas surrounding the Kolleru lake are the worst affected as freshwater aquaculture has been thriving in this region over the years. 
Aquaculture farmers have observed that they are unable to provide the work for those who depend on aquaculture due to lack of work in the wake of postponement of fish harvesting. Several thousands of workers directly depend on aquaculture ponds for daily work including collection and loading of the fish.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-impacts-aquabusiness-in-Krishna-district/article16675677.ece,

Farm sector is among the worst-affected with farmers badly in need of cash to complete the harvest of khariff crops saved against odds in view of drought and start sowing of the winter crops like Bengal gram and tobacco.
Thanks to tight liquidity position, the price of vegetables and other crops are falling.
Cotton growers are in an unenvious position with the price of white gold crashing to about Rs. 4,100 per quintal in the market from about Rs. 5,600 per quintal in the pre-demonetisation period.
“Adding to our woes, the traders are asking us to accept payments in scrapped notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000,” says a group of cotton growers from Inkollur who have deferred plucking hoping that the cash crunch will ease in the next one week to 10 days.
They welcomed the Centre’s decision to allow scrapped notes for purchase of seed and fertilisers during the rabi season.
The monetary crisis has brought to the fore the resilience of the farming community in the post-demonetisation phase.
Farmers, who have been hitherto used to cash transactions mostly, are exploring all ways to stay afloat and undergo pain in the fond hope that better days will come.

Note shortage

“No doubt, we are facing severe cash crunch. We will bear it as the nation will be benefited in the long run as a result of weeding out of black money and counterfeit notes,” says a farmer leader, Jagarlamudi Anil Babu, from the rice-rich Karamchedu village. With only Rs. 2,000 notes made available in banks, there is a huge shortage of notes in Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denomination needed to make payments to farm workers and purchase of farm inputs. “We have found a solution to the persistent problem by deferring payments to farm workers and paying partly in the form of rice,” he says.
“We have started paying the workers partly in the form of rice and stand guarantee to small loans extended to them by the local grocery shops to buy other essential commodities,” says Palaparthi Srinivasa Rao, a farmer from Nagulapupadu. The trust they enjoy with suppliers of farm inputs have ensured uninterrupted supply of pesticides to their farms on credit. “The fertiliser dealers also oblige us by accepting scrapped Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes,” says another farmer, G.Veeraragavalu from Chadalavada. “With no access to institutional credit, tenant farmers, who are mainly depend upon private money lenders, faced difficulty in raising capital for the rabi crop,” says Kuvulu Rythu Sangam State secretary N. Ranga Rao.
The farmers needed about Rs. 3,200 crore in cash, particularly lower denomination of Rs. 50 and Rs. 100 notes to pay farm workers and complete the harvest of khariff crop in about 40 lakh hectares in the State without any hassles, according to YSRC farmers’ wing State president N.V.S.

Flower business has recorded a 50-60 per cent drop owing to the currency crisis in the aftermath of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, claim flower vendors who are into the business since many years. Mujahid Pasha, a flower designer at the market, said, “Those engaged in flower decorations and garland-making used to get a lot of orders, especially in November, from Mysuru and other places in view of weddings. I heard people are putting off weddings owing to cash crunch and this has impacted our business too.”
Jasmine price falls 
With the fall in demand for flowers, jasmine growers are not getting suitable price for their produce. Despite the fall in production, jasmine is being sold at Rs. 350-400 a kg whose price should have been in such a situation between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,200 a kg, flower vendors said. 
Moreover, supply of jasmine variety from Tamil Nadu, which is among the popular variety and an integral part of flower business here, has been affected post-demonetisation.
“The daily supply from cities and towns bordering the State has been cut owing to currency shortage. The vendors don’t give credit and this is one issue which needs to be addressed soon,” said Noor Pasha, a flower vendor.
Noor Pasha said both wholesale and retail business has been dull. “Owing to the issue of change, retail business has seen a fall since we don’t have sufficient change for transactions for a higher denomination note,” Noor Pasha added. 
Khalid, a flower decorator, who along with Mujahid Pasha designs decorative garlands, said a bunch of ornamental roses, which used to cost Rs. 150 (for 20 pieces), is now available for Rs. 40 a bunch. “You can just imagine how the scenario is. Remember, this is the marriage season and the demand should have been more,” he added. For Swamy Gowda and Raje Gowda and Kumara hailing from Bookanakere hobli and Hoskote respectively, who have grown chrysanthemum, their daily earnings from flowers have fallen by 50 per cent.
The market has been flooded with chrysanthemum, but there is no demand and not many takers.
“After paying to labourers for plucking flowers in the fields, we end up earning a meagre Rs. 100 a day growing flowers. Glut and currency crisis has eaten into our revenue,” claim the growers, while searching for flower buyers opposite the Dufferin Clock here.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Flower-business-takes-a-hit-post-demonetisation/article16672345.ece,MYSURU

2016-11-22 22:18:00,Steel flyover vs. demonetisation in Assembly ," The Legislative Assembly on Tuesday saw the Opposition BJP and the Congress choosing steel flyover and demonetisation issues, respectively, to politically outsmart each other.
Irked over BJP member C.T. Ravi’s remarks that the government has given more attention to construction of the controversial steel flyover in Bengaluru and paid only a lip service to drought in villages, the Congress members raised the issue of demonetisation. 
Participating in the discussion on drought and drinking water problem, Mr. Ravi remarked: “Let the government build a steel or silver flyover when there is abundance wealth. But now, more than three-fourths of the taluks in the State have been declared drought-hit and there is no need to spend on construction of the flyover.”
Congress members countered by saying that farmers have not been able to withdraw money from their accounts and purchase seeds and other inputs owing to demonetisation. The Centre was more responsible for sufferings of rural people, said Bengaluru Development Minister K.J. George and Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy. This resulted in a heated exchange of words between the Congress and the BJP members.
Earlier, Opposition JD (S) members sought permission to discuss the impact of demonetisation on District Credit Co-operative Banks through an adjournment motion. When the Speaker asked them to wait till the completion of discussion on drought, JD(S) members trooped into the well of the House and commenced a dharna leading to adjournment of the House for some time.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Steel-flyover-vs.-demonetisation-in-Assembly/article16680700.ece,BELAGAVI

The queue waiting to receive cash from banks has kept increasing ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of high-value currencies to combat black money, Mr. Pandian told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of party workers.
The Central Government which said earlier that the crisis would be resolved in a few weeks is now seeking time extending for a few months, Mr. Pandian said.
On the dry conditions, he said the onus was on the Central and State governments to prevent suicide by farmers due to the failure of monsoons.The State Government must ensure that the 20 kg rice meant for the poor and the benefits of Amma Unavagams reached the farmers and other deserving sections.

2016-11-22 23:59:00,"Post-demonetisation, marriage a knotty affair "," Marriages at the time of demonetisation, marked by cash crunch and restriction on withdrawals from banks, are presenting hard times to families in the State.
Arun V. John, a young banker, is nervous as his marriage is drawing closer.
With just four more days for the wedding, it is the clearing of bills of the ceremony that worries him the most.
Though he had completed all major purchases earlier, he is struggling to raise funds to meet the expenses related to the wedding reception.
Meeting the bills of the caterer, the local guy who has erected shamiana, and at cake shop will be a tough call as their payments have to be made in cash, he said.
Similarly, V.K. Prasad, a former banker, whose daughter is getting married next week, is in a dilemma.
“The Reserve Bank of India’s condition that only one party in a marriage can withdraw Rs. 2.5 lakh from the bank has put me in a fix. If I withdraw money as suggested by the bank, it will inconvenience the bridegroom’s family,” said a worried Mr. Prasad. “One needs cash for meeting minor marriage expenses such as painting, home maintenance, and small purchases where online transactions are not possible,” he said.
The conditions would hit hard those who have raised loans and the amount had been transferred to their bank accounts after November 8, the day demonetisation was announced, he said.
Though most of the upmarket marriage halls in Ernakulam accept online payments, it is not the case with most of the medium-sized halls where payments are settled in cash.
At Pranavam Hall at Vennala, a medium-sized auditorium, all the bills have to be settled in cash.
The rent will come to Rs. 35,000, and another Rs. 10,000 has to be paid as tax. The setting up of the mandapam and stage decoration will cost Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 5,000 has to be paid for cleaning the hall, all in cash, explained manager K. Hariads. In some cases, cash cheques are accepted towards the booking charges, he said.
Nandini Menon, whose daughter is getting married on the first week of December, had planned the events well in advance before the financial crisis hit the market. However, the crisis caught hold of her when she went to collect the wedding dresses from the tailor.
“With currency of lesser denominations unavailable, I could not make the payment at the tailoring shop, and took the stitched clothes on credit,” she explained.",Kerala,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Post-demonetisation-marriage-a-knotty-affair/article16683375.ece,KOCHI

Speakers at the demonstration held in front of the Thanjavur Railway Junction alleged that common people had been forced to suffer due to the Central Government's sudden move to demonetise Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currencies. Considering the plight of the poor and the downtrodden, the Central Government must rescind the order on demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currencies, they demanded. District Congress Committee president T. Krishnasamy Vandayar presided over the demonstration in which many cadres and local party office bearers participated.
The party's town unit also staged a demonstration opposite the Head Post Office here to press the same demands and highlight the issues. District president P.G. Rajendran led the demonstration.

2016-11-22 00:00:00,Denizens find it tough to beat demonetisation blues,"Ever since the night of November 8, Kalyan J. tried a few times to draw some money from the ATMs and another time through the cheque across the counter. He failed both times, once baulking at the huge queues. But, he could not keep out the demonetisation blues from hitting him.
After his SUV got serviced, the automotive centre wanted to know the mode of payment. “No cash...err...what about a cheque?,” he asked. “No cheques sir.” So, it can be moved online to your office account?
“We have opened another account for servicing, please send to it.” But, then its already past online banking hours and next transaction is next day. “There is no money in the banks and I have accounts in a top private and a nationalised bank. They are refusing to accept cheques to give cash across the counter. I am unable to pay my staff and even they are not able to do any transactions,” he bemoans. “I am a regular tax payer and I am not getting access to my money,” he sniggers.
More than dozen days after the ‘D’ bomb dropped by Prime Minister Modi, rarely does one come across anyone not suffering any collateral damage even as the banking system struggles to get going due to the heavy demand on their services.
“There is no money irrespective of whether I try from my savings account or my current account. A token is being issued when cheques are presented and not the amount sought,” sighs Mr. Kalyan, running an ad agency. And, he found it was not that easy to open accounts for his staff to credit salaries as cheque from an existing bank account was sought as “introduction amount”!
As is clear, those not in a hurry to queue up for exchanging old notes or draw money too are feeling the pinch.
“People are used to cash and payment through cheques mean a waiting period of three to four working days. Digital payments has its own limitations in the sense of timings and amount while banks are unable to cope up with the sudden surge,” says M. Raj Kumar, a director of a BPO/retailer firm.
Not just in the city, at Mall, 60 km away, banks are not aware of allowing farmers to withdraw Rs.24,000 too. “They are giving Rs.4,000 to Rs.6,000 only,” claims Narasimha, a tenant farmer.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Denizens-find-it-tough-to-beat-demonetisation-blues/article16721962.ece,
2016-11-22 00:00:00,Hoarders ‘cash’ in on demonetisation,"Black money hoarders in Adilabad seem to be posing an additional problem for bankers, that of weeding out the pre-2005 currency notes from the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. They are trying to take advantage of the current system and slipping the pre-2005 notes, which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014, aiming to exchange them for legal tender.
The issue has been noticed by bankers here, but nothing much is being done about it as they are under tremendous pressure owing to demonetisation. They are, however, able to weed out such currency thanks to the note counting machines which are programmed to detect the silver thread pieces printed before 2005.
The chief cashier at State Bank of Hyderabad, Adilabad main branch, K. Dharmender, singled out one note when an individual came to him to exchange demonetised notes. “This has ceased to be legal tender since long,” he admonished the person on Saturday.
A few days earlier, the staff at Andhra Bank in the town found an individual trying to deposit a few Rs. 500 notes which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014. Some of the staff members took strong objection to it .
In another instance which took place four days back, the note counting machine at Indian Bank beeped furiously as it detected pieces of lapsed currency notes in a bundle which was submitted by a seed dealer to be deposited in his account.
The dealer, who swore the money was given to him by farmers, ended up poorer by Rs. 4,500 as the machine refused to accept 7 of the Rs. 500 notes and one of the Rs. 1,000 bill as they belonged to the series which were banned two years back and can now be exchanged only at the RBI.
According to bankers, the number of older banned notes is much smaller where an individual is concerned, but considerably higher when big business houses or industrialists come into play. Though the old money left with hoarders cannot be quantified at this stage, it is being assumed that they were left with huge stockpiles of the silver thread currency having failed to exchange in the earlier instance, they point out.
The cotton market in Adilabad is an ideal place to launder even the older scrapped currency notes as farmers are being paid in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Hoarders-%E2%80%98cash%E2%80%99-in-on-demonetisation/article16721970.ece,ADILABAD

Ms. Banerjee would be in Delhi on November 23 and 24 and hold a rally at Lucknow on November 29 followed by events in Bihar on December 1 and 2 and also visit Punjab.
“We are ready to join any political programme and anyone can join our programme. This is a movement of people. I have no personal interest in this,” she said.
Her announcement came 72 hours after her deadline in Delhi that she would go for nationwide protests if the government did not withdraw demonetisation.
In West Bengal, her party Trinamool Congress (TMC) had already announced plans of a State-wide protest on Wednesday. While she raised questions on the “hidden agenda” for demonetisation, she accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of threatening the opposition.
“The Prime Minister is threatening other parties who are raising their voices against demonetisation. PM should be sober. PM should behave like a PM. If necessary, he should convene an all-party meeting on the issue,” she said, adding that she would not be “cowed down by such threats.”
“Don’t take it like an ego fight. Did we not support GST [Goods and Services Tax] for the interest of the country knowing that State earnings will drop,” Ms Banerjee said.
Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) marched with the Chit Fund Sufferers Forum during the day and gave a deputation to Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi.
“There is an understanding between the BJP and her [Ms. Banerjee] and she is there to destroy the rest of the Opposition.

Official sources told The Hindu that the team members would hold discussion with bank officials, District Collector, officials of various departments and people from various walks of life to get a feedback on the situation from five different angles. 
The special team officials would initially check the currency availability in bank branches and ATMs across the district and the facilities set up at banks for withdrawal, deposit and exchange of currency notes. 
Already, widespread complaints were there from the industrial clusters across the district about the lack of adequate currencies in the ATMs with many of the machines remaining non-operational for long time. 
Even the ATM situated next door to the Lead Bank office in Tirupur Collectorate has not been opened for the past few days due to the non-availability of currencies especially in the denomination of Rs 100. 
The team members would then examine whether the calibration of the ATMs to dispense Rs. 2,000 and the new Rs. 500 currency notes was going at the desired pace. 
The impact of demonetisation on households, industrial and informal sectors, transportation, farmers and daily wage earners would be studied separately.

The party’s Coimbatore Urban District president V.M.C. Manoharan, who along with his rural counterpart K. Mahesh Kumar led the protest, said that after announcing demonetisation, the Government did not take enough steps to mitigate the plight of the common man.
People continued to queue up outside banks and ATMs. But it was of no use as both banks and ATMs ran out of cash by noon.
Adding to the worry was the Government giving new instruction every day. It first fixed the exchange limit at Rs. 4,000, then increased it to Rs. 4,500 and now reduced it to Rs. 2,000.
Mr. Manoharan said that what the Government was doing was taxing common man in the name of fighting black money. The Congress, therefore, wanted to protest to highlight the common man’s suffering, he added. The police removed around 100 protesters from the venue.

PCC president Sachin Pilot, who held a meeting of the party leaders to discuss the issue, said people were facing a tough time due to the currency crisis and no relief measures were taken by the government for the convenience of people who are lined up in queues to exchange currency notes.
Referring to various reports, he said that close to 100 people have died due to the decision of the government and people have to wait for hours in bank queues to change the notes.
“Production and business in the entire country has been badly affected. Daily wagers are without work, farmers are not getting buyers for their agriculture produce and they also have no money to buy seeds and fertilizers which would create crisis of food in the days to come,” Mr. Pilot said.
He said that the government’s decision to not charge toll tax should be continued and free distribution of ration should be there in slum areas and to BPL families who are short of money.
“There is resentment among people which is being ignored by the government. Trade and industry stakeholders are also in trouble due to the decision,” he said.
Pilot said that the Congress welcomes the decision of demonetisation but the hardship faced by the people cannot be ignored or tolerated.

These heaps of plastic waste are only getting bigger with each passing day, as are the lines on Alam’s forehead. After repeatedly trying to call someone, the 20-year-old turns to his mother and says, “Phone abhi bhi band hai [the mobile phone is still switched off].”

Shutting shop

Most shops that deal in scrap near Seemapuri slums in north-east Delhi, which is where Alam lives with his family, have shut shop since Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 currency notes.
The reason being that the scrap dealers have no change to pay for the waste plastic they buy from garbage collectors.

Caught off-guard

“The few shops that are open are buying it for half the price and forcing us to accept old notes. What do we do with these notes?” said Alam, the youngest of five siblings.
The news of demonetisation took Alam and his family by surprise. Their immediate worry was the few thousand rupees they had saved over the past few years.
A day after the announcement, Alam was among those who lined up outside a bank with Rs.10,000 in his pocket.
“There was a huge rush. Like hundreds others, I skipped work and stood in a line to exchange the old notes. My turn didn’t come. I went again the next day and waited several hours, only to be told that I couldn’t get Rs.10,000 exchanged, and that I would have to deposit the money instead. I came back empty-handed as I don’t have an account,” he said.
So demoralised were Alam and his family that they joined their neighbours in an impromptu protest.
Reality, however, dawned on Alam the next day when he required the new currency to take care of his family’s daily expenses. His family includes two differently-abled nephews.
Alam then met a bank employee, who told him that he could get Rs.4,000 exchanged at a time.
“I reached the bank with a blanket at 8 p.m. and slept in the queue with several others. Next morning, I managed to get two Rs.2,000 notes,” he said with a smile.

Short-lived joy

But his happiness was short-lived. He was in for a shock when he reached the market the next day.
“The shopkeepers refused to accept the new currency. They claimed not to have change. Ultimately, I had to buy a big sack of rice worth Rs.1,000 and get some grocery from another shop. Thankfully, I now have a few Rs.100 notes,” he said.

2016-11-22 00:33:00,Denizens find it tough to beat demonetisation blues,"Ever since the night of November 8, Kalyan J. tried a few times to draw some money from the ATMs and another time through the cheque across the counter. He failed both times, once baulking at the huge queues. But, he could not keep out the demonetisation blues from hitting him.
After his SUV got serviced, the automotive centre wanted to know the mode of payment. “No cash...err...what about a cheque?,” he asked. “No cheques sir.” So, it can be moved online to your office account? 
“We have opened another account for servicing, please send to it.” But, then its already past online banking hours and next transaction is next day. “There is no money in the banks and I have accounts in a top private and a nationalised bank. They are refusing to accept cheques to give cash across the counter. I am unable to pay my staff and even they are not able to do any transactions,” he bemoans. “I am a regular tax payer and I am not getting access to my money,” he sniggers. 
More than dozen days after the ‘D’ bomb dropped by Prime Minister Modi, rarely does one come across anyone not suffering any collateral damage even as the banking system struggles to get going due to the heavy demand on their services. 
“There is no money irrespective of whether I try from my savings account or my current account. A token is being issued when cheques are presented and not the amount sought,” sighs Mr. Kalyan, running an ad agency. And, he found it was not that easy to open accounts for his staff to credit salaries as cheque from an existing bank account was sought as “introduction amount”! 
As is clear, those not in a hurry to queue up for exchanging old notes or draw money too are feeling the pinch. 
“People are used to cash and payment through cheques mean a waiting period of three to four working days. Digital payments has its own limitations in the sense of timings and amount while banks are unable to cope up with the sudden surge,” says M. Raj Kumar, a director of a BPO/retailer firm. 
Not just in the city, at Mall, 60 km away, banks are not aware of allowing farmers to withdraw Rs.24,000 too. “They are giving Rs.4,000 to Rs.6,000 only,” claims Narasimha, a tenant farmer.

Hundreds of spotted deer and sambar deer of the deer park on Hill Palace campus, Thripunithura, may go hungry if the restriction on cash withdrawal from banks continues beyond the month end. There are 226 spotted deer and 27 sambar deer at the one-and-a-half-acre enclosure on the campus. 
The weekly ceiling of Rs.24,000 on withdrawal of cash from banks is threatening to deny feed to the caged animals.
Each month, the Centre for Heritage Studies (CHS), which is managing the deer park, pays a significant amount for the purchase of fodder and cattle feed. If the restrictions are not eased, it could lead to a possible stoppage of the purchase of feed. 
The monthly payment for fodder and feed, which would come to around Rs.1.25 lakh, is advanced to the agencies concerned on the first day of every month. Since the payment for the current month was paid earlier, feed and fodder would be available till this month end.

2016-11-22 23:32:00,Demonetisation’s positives unlikely to be strong: Fitch,"Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday the government’s decision on demonetisation that had created a cash crunch would constrain economic activities in the short-term forcing the credit rating agency to cut its GDP forecast for the fourth quarter.
“The impact on GDP growth will increase the longer the disruption continues,” it said.
Fitch also said benefits from the withdrawal of high-denomination currencies were unlikely to be enduring enough to result in a change in the outlook for India’s sovereign rating.
Government revenue
“The move has the potential to raise government revenue and encourage bank lending, but Fitch Ratings believes the positive effects are unlikely to be strong and sufficiently enduring to support credit profiles,” Fitch said in a statement.
 “Demonetisation is a one-off event. People that operate in the informal sector will still be able to use the new high-denomination bills and other options (like gold) to store their wealth. There are no new incentives for people to avoid cash transactions. The informal sector could soon go back to business as usual,” it said. 
On the impact of the move on the banking sector, Fitch said while banks would gain low-cost deposits, it remained to be seen whether the deposits would stay with banks beyond a few months.
“The positive impact on funding conditions will depend on deposits remaining in banks beyond the next few months. There is nothing to prevent them being withdrawn again,” it said. reaffirming its negative outlook on the banking sector. Banks have received more than Rs.5 lakh crore since November 9.
Asset quality
 “Demonetisation could also affect the ability of borrowers in sectors that rely on cash transactions to service their loans, with negative effects on bank asset quality, which is why the RBI has temporarily allowed banks to give small borrowers more time to repay loans.”
Under-capitalisation of state-owned banks and weak investment demand were also among factors holding back lending, Fitch said.",Economy,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation%E2%80%99s-positives-unlikely-to-be-strong-Fitch/article16682643.ece,MUMBAI 
2016-11-22 00:45:00,Behind demonetisation,"Demonetisation was to strike at the roots of black money, counterfeit notes and terror funding. But the fact is that an all-cash currency economy is not evil or bad but essential for our type of economy. Demonetisation must strike at the roots of those who have accumulated wealth through corrupt practices. It
will be a success when the common man gains, the middle class is confident, the corrupt are struck by fear and the wealthy know they have to abide by the laws of the land.

Mathew George,


Thiruvananthapuram

The popular explanation is that demonetisation is a surgical strike to remove black money, to paralyse the terrorist and to weed out fake currency. This argument is very convincing but the purpose appears to be multifold. The main benefit is to increase the value of rupee relative to other international currencies such as the dollar, the euro and the yen.
In a cash economy, currency is parked and the Reserve Bank has to keep printing more money to keep the economy going. The total value of national wealth must be declared regularly and accounted. One waits for the day when the Indian rupee can be floated as an international currency. But for this, there has to be an attempt to raise productivity.

“Politicians behind chit fund scams are now attacking me, says Modi” (Nov.21) may be a catchy heading but the Prime Minister cannot forget that in a democratic set-up, the Opposition plays an important role in raising genuine issues/concerns regarding ongoing policies. Specific answers should be given to the Opposition. The Opposition has collectively raised a genuine concern and citizens expect a specific and relevant answer to the point raised.

Lalita Ramakrishnan,

It is shocking that black money hoarders are now heading to temples to make those they worship partners in crime (“Demonetised notes pour into TTD temple hundis”, Nov.21). The TTD administration should send all such notes to the Enforcement Directorate where they should be destroyed. It should also make an announcement that demonetised notes will not be accepted.

2016-11-22 00:09:00,Demonetisation won’t have lasting benefits: Larry Summers,"Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has said that the Narendra Modi government’s demonetisation move would not have any lasting benefits
In a blog post, co-written with Natasha Sarin, a PhD scholar at the Harvard University, Mr. Summers said, “Without new measures to combat... corruption will continue albeit with slightly different arrangements”.
 
Terming India’s demonetisation move as one of the “most sweeping change in currency policy that has occurred anywhere in the world in decades”, Mr. Summers said, “…For the government to expropriate from even a few innocent victims who, for one reason or another, do not manage to convert their money is highly problematic.”
 
“We strongly suspect that those with the largest amount of ill-gotten gain do not hold their wealth in cash but instead have long since converted it into foreign exchange, gold, bitcoin or some other store of value. So it is petty fortunes, not the hugest and most problematic ones, that are being targeted,” Mr. Summers, currently Charles W. Eliot Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard, said.

But of course for different reasons.
In the U.S. there was ‘anger on the streets’, with protestors displaying placards with the message ‘Not My President’. More than a thousand CEOs urged Donald Trump to ‘stop divisive politics’. It was really ‘shock and awe’, and a news magazine had reportedly prepared its issue in anticipation of a Hillary victory.
In India, people were on the street, fretting and fuming about the delay in exchanging their old notes with new ones and over malfunctioning of or non-availability of cash in ATMs. Even after three days I found several ATMs closed or non-functional, while others had not seen the cash delivery van since the demonetisation demon was unleashed. The cash crunch led to sporadic violence, and ration shops in some places were looted. While there were some cases of dire distress, there were others of philanthropic humanitarianism, where shopkeepers extended credit facility to their customers.
Nevertheless, there was a general public perception that the initiative, though welcome since it could have a positive domino effect on the economy over the long term, had been launched without adequate preparation and hence the arrangements for implementation left much to be desired. Some remedial measures were, of course, introduced subsequently; but given the small size of the premises of most of the bank branches and the logistics of queue management, I wonder how many of them could actually be implemented. One thing is, however, certain; everyone was made to fall in line. It also reinforced the virtue of frugality and established the supremacy of small currency. People were found ‘flaunting’ hundred rupee notes.
Politicians had their own take on the event. The decision was variously described as ‘Tuglaqi farman’, an anti-poor measure and an undeclared financial emergency. It was alleged that having made arrangement for itself, the ruling party had attempted to stymie the Opposition in the coming elections. On a more sober note, it was also suggested that the withdrawal of the currency should have been preceded by an announcement a few days earlier. 
Three of them
 
At a personal level, I belong to that generation that has been witness to three demonetisations so far. I actually felt nostalgic, since the realigned composition of my wallet reminded me of an era gone by, when it used to consist of mostly ten rupee notes and coins, and an occasional hundred rupee note. But I did not have to rush to banks or ATMs. As a pensioner, my monthly pension gets credited into my bank account a few days before the end of the month. 
I therefore make it a point to withdraw the money required for the next month, during the last couple of days of the previous month. I also ask my bank to give me the money in notes of different denominations, including at least one bundle of 100 rupee notes. When the bolt from the blue came, I had a considerable stock of 100 rupee notes to defray the daily milk and vegetable charges for a few months. But my plan was found wanting on one count. Since I had withdrawn currency notes of higher denominations too just a few days ago, I had to put them back in the bank.
For a variety of reasons, including demonetisation of currency in India and the unexpected result of the elections in the U.S., some individuals wanted to drown their sorrows (also known as gam galat karana in Hindi, popularised by such icons as Devdas) in their favourite brand of the bubbly. But they were in for a shock on two counts. First, since the shops would not entertain high denomination notes; and, second, if someone bought a small measure with lower currency and tried to down it in public in Delhi, he would have been fined Rs. 5,000 for the offence in the first instance.
The collectors of old coins and currency notes too were licking their lips in anticipation of a windfall in future. Cases of small thefts perceptibly declined; in one case the snatched purse was returned with a slap. In case of temples, the old notes are still current and the government is unlikely to ask any questions because, in a sense, it amounts to payment of tax directly to God, the original source of the coffers of the Reserve Bank of India.
At the end of the day, I was delighted to receive mint-fresh, crisp currency notes after a long time, having been routinely dished out senselessly vandalised and hopelessly frayed ones by the banks with sickening regularity.

“The decision of demonetisation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is historic. Freedom fighters sacrificed their lives to make India independent. Those who are supporting demonetisation are freedom fighters for economic independence...There are people who are opposing the move. They are nothing but anti-nationals,” said Mr. Fadnavis.
The CM went on to compare the plight of citizens facing the cash crunch to the Army jawans. “Our jawans stand at the border to protect the country. They do not have any personal animosity with Pakistan. If they can do it, can’t you suffer for 50 days for the country’s benefit?”
Reacting to his comments, the Congress said declaring the opposition as anti-national is nothing but an attempt to shift the democratic country towards dictatorship. “For the last two years, the Sangh parivar and the BJP have been playing the game of patriotism. All those who are talking against Mr. Modi are being termed anti-nationals. Protesting the irresponsible government and lousy bureaucracy cannot be anti-national,” said party spokesperson Sachin Sawant.
He said the government has taken the decision without proper homework and adequate measures. “The actual black money hoarders are out in the open, but common citizens are standing in queues to withdraw their honestly-earned money.”

Speaking to the media persons, he said the co-operative banking sector was the worst-hit as the availability of money made was less. “Co-operative banking sector is the backbone of the rural India and the Banking Regulation Act that govern the commerical banks is applicable to it. Now that the khariff season has ended, the farmers have no money to give to the farm hands. To raise the second crop they have no money to buy seed, pesticides and fertilizers,” he said.
He blamed the Centre for its ham-handed executing of demonetisation exercise and felt that more number of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 notes must have been available to the public. “Releasing Rs. 2,000 is a big mistake. No one is giving change for Rs. 2,000 and for the past 12 days people across India are suffering. The badly hit are those in the lower section of the society,” he said. He felt corruption cannot be stopped even after the initiative. “It is an open secret that in all public works, kickbacks up to 5 and 7 per cent were being paid.”",Vijayawada,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/Vadde-faults-Centre-on-demonetisation/article16722152.ece,VIJAYAWADA
2016-11-22 19:56:00,Cyber crime rate drops post demonetisation in city,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Post demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, the Cyber Crime Police station here expected a spurt in the cyber crime rate. But it turned out to be the other way round.
“There is sudden drop in the cyber crime rate and in the last 10 days no fresh case has been reported. In normal times, we would record at least two cases per day”, Inspector of Cyber Crime Police Station K. Satyanarayana Rao said.
After notifying that the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would no longer be legal tender there has been a huge rush at the banks to exchange the old notes and withdraw small change. “Many have switched to online banking to save time and avoid the rush, and this prompted us to be cautious, as there were many first time online bankers, who included senior citizens and from rural areas. Keeping this in mind we expected a spurt in the crime rate,” he added.
DCP (Crime) T. Ravi Kumar Murthy attributes the drop in crime rate to the cautious approach by people or it may be just a lull before the criminals strike it rich. “And what is needed at this moment is educating the people on the online usage,” said the DCP. 
This year, the Cyber Crime Police Station recorded about 250 cases till October 30 and of them 190 pertain to cases where criminals could persuade the victims to divulge their OTP (One Time Password). 
According to Head of the Department of Computer Science of Andhra University College of Engineering P.V.G.D. Prasada Reddy, online transactions would increase from now and cyber criminals will be on the prowl. Apart from securing the systems, the process must be more user-friendly.
The authorities concerned should think of incorporating regional language in the user interface. Rural people will benefit from this move, he said.
Moreover, to make the system more simpler and security-proof, the interface should also be made voice enabled. This apart, the government should now also think of organising mass training camps to educate the people, especially the rural people, to enable them to use the online system more securely, said Prof. Prasada Reddy.
As per the National Crime Record Bureau Visakhapatnam city, has been ranked second after Bangalore in the country to record maximum number of cyber crimes since 2011.",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Cyber-crime-rate-drops-post-demonetisation-in-city/article16677201.ece,

The on-going annual book exhibition, presented by Visalandhra Book House, primarily aims at rekindling the joy of reading.
A major part of the fair includes Telugu titles stocked in different sections. However, a good number of English titles have also been on display at the venue. Of all, ‘Sagaragosha’ written by Garikipati Narasimha Rao, ‘Ardhanareeswarudu’ written by Perumal Murugan and translated by L.R. Swamy, ‘Vibhajana Katha’ by Vundavalli Arunkumar and ‘Runam’ by Gollapudi Maruthi Rao are flying off the shelves like hot cakes.
Though the organisers of the book fair are accepting old currency notes, they mentioned that the sales dropped by 40 per cent when compared to previous exhibitions. “Customers can pay Rs.1,000 or Rs.500 for the purchase provided they buy books worth Rs.900 or Rs.400 in exchange of demonetised notes,” P.A. Raju, manager of the book house, said and added that a portion of the stock could not reach the city in time after the Centre’s demonetisation move.
Bookworms, who came to stuff the bags with their favourite titles, said the government’s demonetisation decision did not impact their purchase power. “Ardent readers will always find a way out. I prefer spending my pocket money for books. With the acceptance of demonetised notes, shopping turns out to be a hassle-free experience,” shares T. Madhu, M.Sc student of Andhra University.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised the higher denominations notes without providing an alternative or putting in place proper method to compensate their absence in the market subjecting the people to a lot of hardships, Mr. Hanumantha Rao said at a press conference.
There were also divergent statements on the situation coming under control. While Mr. Modi said it would take about 40 days, Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu assured that things would be in place in 10 to 15 days while Chief Minister N.

2016-11-23 00:07:00,Modi destabilised many sectors with demonetisation: Chinta Mohan," CHITTOOR: Former Union Minister and senior Congress leader P. Chinta Mohan on Tuesday flayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu over demonetisation issue, and predicted that the NDA government at the Centre and the TDP government in AP would be routed in 2019 elections.
Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Chinta Mohan said that the demonetisation of big currency had affected over 80% of people in India, particularly the agrarian and urban poor. He observed that the adverse impact of demonetisation would take over six years to clear. ""The Modi government move had destabilised the health, business, agriculture and allied sectors in the country,"" he said.
The former MP said that the prime intention of Modi in announcing demonetisation of big currency was to encourage the corporate sector as he was hand in glove with them. Modi was spreading falsehood that he was a tea-master. ""In fact, Modi never sold tea. He was fostered by the RSS and he happened to work in a tea bunk for a while. He is also a school dropout at fourth class, but got his degrees while he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat,"" Mr. Chinta Mohan said.
The Congress leader alleged that Modi was anti-poor, as he had over five thousand dress materials worth over Rs 50 crore.
Terming Modi as ""icon of black money,"" Mr. Chinta Mohan alleged that during 2014 elections, Modi had pooled up black money to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore and the deal was struck with corporate groups at a star hotel in New Delhi. ""As Advani could not move ahead with the deal of pooling up black money, he lost the opportunity of becoming the Prime minster and the post went in favour of Modi,"" the Congress leader alleged. ""At present, there is a rethinking on Modi leadership in BJP, and some are favouring Rajnath Singh to be their future leader. The Cabinet colleagues are facing a tough time with Modi as he doesn’t bother at all to respect their feelings,"" Mr. Chinta Mohan maintained.
Referring to AP, the former MP faulted Chandrababu Naidu for his stand on demonetisation. ""Mr. Naidu is frequently going to New Delhi to prompt handing over of a private port in Srikakulam to Modi's associate Gowtham Adani. Naidu exposed his corruption with Rs. 11 crore deposits in his infant grandson's account,"" he said.
The former Union minister demanded that the Centre should take prompt steps to issue salaries to all employees, besides overcoming the adverse impact of demonetisation in 15 days. 
He also opposed the AP government's move to merge the Sri City SEZ in Chittoor district with Nellore district, allegedly to help foster the interests of Municipal Administration Minister P. Narayana.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Modi-destabilised-many-sectors-with-demonetisation-Chinta-Mohan/article16683685.ece,
2016-11-23 00:00:00,Demonetisation: Tribals too feel the pinch,"Thousands of tribal people feel the pinch of the demonetisation of Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes as they are not able to sell their produce for the last two weeks. They are also facing trouble in depositing and exchanging their money in banks. Around 3,000 families out of 12,500 in the tribal mandals under ITDA-Sithampet region could get Jan-Dhan bank accounts under the financial inclusion programme. NABARD and local NGOs had explained them the benefits of the banking system and made them to open accounts in nearby mandal headquarters such as Sithampet, Palakonda, Kotturu, Bhamini, and Veeraghattam.
However, they have to travel at least 30 km to reach the bank from hilly areas. Many villages do not have road network and transport facility. In fact, many farmers have regular income with the sale of their produce in shandies in places like Sithampet, Kusumi, Polla, and Dhonubhai.

Price fall

“We used to get around Rs.8 per piece of cauliflower. Its price has gone down to Rs.5 with the traders reluctant to buy them due to non-availability of Rs.100 notes.
Many of them are not taking even on credit basis as they are also facing troubles to transport them to cities like Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam,” says Arika Durgarao, a tribal farmer in Kotturu.
“With great difficulty, we could arrange Rs.800, all Rs.100 notes, to families in places like Dhonubhai and Kusumi. The local trader agreed to take old currency notes and give Rs.100 notes to the needy families,” says Nuka Sanyasi Rao, director of ARTS, a non-governmental organisation.

Plea to ITDA

People’s representatives of all parties urged the ITDA to provide exchange of notes for the tribal families since a majority of them don’t have banking facility.

A bench. led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur, said the petitions in the various courts highlight ""the different inconveniences highlighted in the various cases filed across the country, maybe some relief can be had by these people"".
The Supreme Court had refused to ""shut its door"" to the ""frantic and affected"" public.
The court allowed cash-starved co-operative banks to approach their respective High Courts for succour.
The Centre, however, maintained that the demonetisation policy, an exercise meant to weed out black money and cripple terror funding, is a success.
""So is it [demonetisation] a success?"" Chief Justice Thakur asked Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi.
""No doubt. Rs. 6 lakh crore has been deposited in banks. The banks are flush with money and lending rates will come down,"" Mr Rohatgi responded.
The AG said queues in front of banks and ATMS have thinned and the situation would resume normality in the next 20 days.
The court asked whether farmers are able to buy seeds at the peak of the rabi season.
Mr. Rohatgi informed that alternate arrangements have been made, special teams sent to all the States and the situation was monitored on an hourly basis.

2016-11-23 22:28:00,Impact of demonetisation hits milk producers too," Milk producers across Mysuru district have not been spared from the impact of demonetisation.
The cooperative milk producers’ societies had been finding it difficult to pay producers once a week or 10 days upon getting payment to their respective bank accounts from the Mysore Milk Union owing to the ceiling fixed on cash withdrawal.
Since the withdrawal limit a week had been fixed at Rs. 24,000, the societies have been unable to withdraw sufficient cash to pay milk producers registered under it.
The producers’ are either given part payment or their consent taken to transfer money to their accounts if they don’t need the money immediately.
Though almost all the milk producers have bank accounts since the government subsidy of Rs. 4 a litre was directly credited to their accounts, the producers mostly prefer cash payments owing to limited banking facility.
Sources at the Mysuru Milk Union told The Hindu that the societies had been asked to manage the crisis locally and credit the producers’ payment to their accounts henceforth.
“Milk producers have been affected by the cash crisis. Each society gets at least Rs. 1 lakh a week as payment towards milk supply to the union. With the withdrawal limit being Rs. 24,000 a week, it is difficult to make payments to all,” the sources said.
About 89,580 milk producers are registered with the Mysuru union, which procures milk from them daily through the milk producers’ cooperative societies. Mysuru district alone has over 950 cooperative milk producers’ societies.
The union’s current daily milk procurement stands at 6.5 lakh litres. Production had been affected owing to drought and scarcity of fodder.
An officer at the Mysore Milk Union said that around Rs. 7 crore was paid to producers through their respective societies once a week or within 10 days. “By and large, cash transactions had been most preferred by the producers as many are averse to visiting banks for deposits or withdrawals. The currency crisis and restrictions in withdrawal for farmers’ cooperatives are being managed locally,” he said.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Impact-of-demonetisation-hits-milk-producers-too/article16689257.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-23 17:10:00,Demonetisation likely to rob sheen off Kannada Sahitya Sammelan ," Demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes is likely to affect 82nd Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelan scheduled to be held in the first week of December in Raichur in more than one way. As per well-placed sources closely associated with the organisation of the literary event, the target of mobilising Rs. 2 crore from local sources cannot be met as the potential donors - businessmen, rice mill owners, traders and alike – themselves are in financial trouble.
“Businessmen usually donate in cash as they have huge unaccounted money which is normally in the form of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. With the demonetisation of these high value notes, they are unable to make donations. They are not so generous to donate their accounted money through cheques and electronic transfer. The major source of fund mobilisation has thus dried up with the demonetisation,” an organiser associated with the Sammelana activities said.
Sasikanth S. Senthil, Deputy Commissioner of Raichur, who looks after financial matters, is confident of organising the literary event with the funds provided by the State government. He is of the opinion that Rs. 4 crore that the government has allocated for the event is a “decent amount” for neat conduct of the event. Considering the demonetisation and resultant crunch of fund mobilisation, he has approached the potential donors appealing to them to offer their contributions in the form of goods and services required for the event instead of cash donations.
“Hundreds of hotel rooms have been booked for providing accommodation to guests. In a normal condition, we would have collected donations and pay for the rooms. Now, upon our request in view of demonetisation, the hotel owners have agreed to provide rooms free of cost. Similarly, several other responsibilities and tasks that require money are being entrusted to many people,” Mr. Senthil told The Hindu.
Vishnukanth Budadi of Shilpa Medicare Limited and Raichur Rice Millers Association have similarly agreed to provide food to guests and general public for three days, Mahantesh Maski, former district president of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat said.
In order to manage with limited financial resources, the organising committee is planning drop many proposals to cut costs. “We will have to use the funds judiciously. We will put money on unavoidable expenditure such as erecting stage and cultural teams. We may have to avoid providing jackets to mediapersons and other such expenditures,” Mr. Senthil said.
Using the surplus money after the Sammelana, a Kannada Bhavana is normally built for the parishat at the town where sahitya sammelan is organised. But this time, the organisers are not sure that they can save some money for purpose.

Irked over BJP member C.T. Ravi’s remarks that the government has given more attention to construction of the controversial steel flyover in Bengaluru and paid only a lip service to drought in villages, the Congress members raised the issue of demonetisation.
Participating in the discussion on drought and drinking water problem, Mr. Ravi remarked: “Let the government build a steel or silver flyover when there is abundance wealth. But now, more than three-fourths of the taluks in the State have been declared drought-hit and there is no need to spend on construction of the flyover.”
Congress members countered by saying that farmers have not been able to withdraw money from their accounts and purchase seeds and other inputs owing to demonetisation. The Centre was more responsible for sufferings of rural people, said Bengaluru Development Minister K.J. George and Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy. This resulted in a heated exchange of words between the Congress and the BJP members.

2016-11-23 00:00:00,Demonetisation: Udupi Co-ops. Union to approach High Court,"The Udupi District Co-operatives Union on Tuesday decided to approach the High Court of Karnataka on the issue of reduced cash inflow to cooperative societies in the district due to the Union government’s move to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.
Jayakar Shetty Indralli, director of the union, said that all the members of the union had agreed to approach the High Court on this issue as they had exhausted all other options.
Earlier, addressing a meeting of the office-bearers of all co-operative societies of the district, Kishan Hegde Kolkebail, president of the Udupi District Co-operatives Union Ltd., said that the co-operative societies were choking due to the Union government’s demonetisation move.
The co-operatives union was not against the demonetisation move. But this had reduced the cash inflow at cooperative societies drastically and it had become difficult for them to carry out their day-to-day business. The cash inflow to the societies was just 0.9 per cent.
After the government demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8, the union had directed all co-operative societies not to accept these denomination notes for either deposits or loan repayment. With the result, most of the business of the societies had come to a standstill.
The constant change of guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on acceptance of currency notes had created an atmosphere of confusion. There were 53 agricultural credit co-operative societies and 253 credit co-operative societies in the district with over 3.75 lakh members.
Most of the activities of the credit co-operative societies were concentrated in the rural areas. The societies were not able to provide services to the rural people after the demonetisation move. As money in circulation had gone down, loan repayment too was affected.
For the last 12 days, it had become difficult for the societies to either provide money from the deposit-holders’ savings accounts. The District Co-operatives Union had approached both the Union and State governments and written several letters to them about the reduced cash inflow, but these attempts had not yielded any fruit. “All co-operative societies have enough funds to repay the depositors and there has been no Income Tax raids on any of the cooperative societies in the district. People should not get taken in by rumours,” Mr. Kolkebail said.

But I cannot stand the whole day in front of the bank to change it. Hence, I gave it to a shopkeeper. He agreed to take it on the condition that I purchase provisions for at least Rs.200. I had no option but to agree. I cannot blame it on either contractors or people, who construct buildings since they themselves have no money,” he said.
Jayavel, also a mason, said only 20 out of hundred workers who turn up in the park get work. Several ongoing construction works were suspended, he says. 
Nehru, state president of Tamil Maanila Kattida Thozhilalar Sangam, based in Tiruvannamalai, a labour contractor, says he normally employed 50-60 labours a day at different project sites. But now he could hardly employ 10 per cent of them. 
“Almost all the projects I have been involved in have been completely suspended. As far as construction of houses is concerned, house owners could not mobilise money in smaller currencies. We need to give wages in cash and no other form is acceptable to labours. It became impossible to buy materials with little cash to spare,” he added.
Hardware and cement shops too face a slump. Subashchandrabose, proprietor of a hardware shop, said that they virtually had no business ever since the demonetisation was launched. “We get only a little fraction of our original business, that too in small volumes.

We need to pay labourers, rent, electricity etc. It has definitely affected businessmen, workers and contractors”.

2016-11-23 00:00:00,Tackling demonetisation,"Since the announcement of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, commercial establishments, retail outlets, and small-scale vendors are looking at various options for customers to make payments without any hindrance.
Several options that are becoming popular are online transfer, pre-paid cards, use of credit or debit cards and mobile wallets. Banks are promoting their online and mobile banking facilities. Be it cab drivers or roadside vendors, many are starting to explore these options as they face shortage of cash, especially of smaller denominations.
However, customers who need cash for daily purchases and payments are finding it difficult to withdraw the required money as ATMs are not operating in most places and banks are unable to meet the entire fund requirement of the customers who want to withdraw cash.
In an effort to help the public locate the nearest ATMs with cash, several crowd sourced tools have been introduced. cashnocash.com is one such popular tool. When the pincode is typed by a user, it lists the nearby ATMs and also says whether these have cash or not. The users can update the site based on their experience at the ATM.
Another is ATMBot, developed by Coimbatore-based start-up Timebender Technologies. Within 48 years of launch, 6,000 customers were served and so far about 15,000. In this too, the information is crowd-sourced.
The users withdraw cash and click a button on ATMBot, a web robot that runs inside Facebook’s messenger, to say whether the ATM had cash or not. The data is real-time, says its CEO Abishek.

2016-11-23 00:00:00,Hoarders ‘cash’ in on demonetisation,"Black money hoarders in Adilabad seem to be posing an additional problem for bankers, that of weeding out the pre-2005 currency notes from the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. They are trying to take advantage of the current system and slipping the pre-2005 notes, which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014, aiming to exchange them for legal tender.
The issue has been noticed by bankers here, but nothing much is being done about it as they are under tremendous pressure owing to demonetisation. They are, however, able to weed out such currency thanks to the note counting machines which are programmed to detect the silver thread pieces printed before 2005.
The chief cashier at State Bank of Hyderabad, Adilabad main branch, K. Dharmender, singled out one note when an individual came to him to exchange demonetised notes. “This has ceased to be legal tender since long,” he admonished the person on Saturday.
A few days earlier, the staff at Andhra Bank in the town found an individual trying to deposit a few Rs. 500 notes which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014. Some of the staff members took strong objection to it .
In another instance which took place four days back, the note counting machine at Indian Bank beeped furiously as it detected pieces of lapsed currency notes in a bundle which was submitted by a seed dealer to be deposited in his account.
The dealer, who swore the money was given to him by farmers, ended up poorer by Rs. 4,500 as the machine refused to accept 7 of the Rs. 500 notes and one of the Rs. 1,000 bill as they belonged to the series which were banned two years back and can now be exchanged only at the RBI.
According to bankers, the number of older banned notes is much smaller where an individual is concerned, but considerably higher when big business houses or industrialists come into play. Though the old money left with hoarders cannot be quantified at this stage, it is being assumed that they were left with huge stockpiles of the silver thread currency having failed to exchange in the earlier instance, they point out.
The cotton market in Adilabad is an ideal place to launder even the older scrapped currency notes as farmers are being paid in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Hoarders-%E2%80%98cash%E2%80%99-in-on-demonetisation/article16722390.ece,ADILABAD

2016-11-23 00:00:00,‘BJP wins mandate on demonetisation’,"The BJP on Tuesday won the by-poll to Lakhimpur Lok Sabha and Baithalangso Assembly seats in Assam defeating Congress, its nearest rival.
Party candidate Pradan Barua won the Lakhaimpur LS seat by a margin of 1,90,219 votes defeating his nearest rival Congress’s Hema Prasanga Pegu by a convincing 1,90,219 votes, the returning officer said.
BJP retained the seat, which was earlier held by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal who quit it to contest the Majuli assembly seat in April this year and take on the reins of the state.
Mansing Rongpi won the Baithalangso Assembly seat. While he retained the seat, BJP won the seat as the contestant had resigned from Congress to join it in July which necessitated the by—poll this year.
Rongpi defeated his nearest Congress rival Ruponsing Ronghang by 16,600 votes. Rongpi garnered 72,160 votes, while Ronghang polled 55,560 votes, said the returning officer.
Meanwhile, Mr Sonowal termed the BJP’s win as the “mandate” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise the Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes.
“BJP’s victory in by-polls is a clear indication that people are fully supporting the decision to demonetise Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes. It is people’s mandate for the Prime Minister’s decision of demonetisation,” he told reporters here.
The Chief Minister said people responded overwhelmingly in support of Modi’s call for eradicating black money and a clear indication that the BJP-led governments at the Centre and Assam were performing well.
The BJP has won the recently held by-polls in Lakhimpur Lok Sabha constituency and Baithalangshu Assembly seat.
Sonowal met the Prime Minister and appealed him to ensure monitoring of construction of fencing along the Indo-Bangladesh border through Army for speedy completion.
The Chief Minister also discussed with the Prime Minister a spectrum of issues ranging from demonetisation to law and order situation in Assam. He apprised Mr Modi of different steps the State government has taken with the help of the Reserve Bank of India to facilitate smooth flow of new currency notes in every nook and corner of the state in the wake of demonetisation of high currency notes. - PTI",Delhi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/%E2%80%98BJP-wins-mandate-on-demonetisation%E2%80%99/article16722513.ece,Lakhimpur/Boithalangso
2016-11-23 01:16:00,‘Daily labourers hardest hit by demonetisation’," Daily-wage labourers have been hit the hardest by the Centre’s decision to demonetise the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, as workers are not able to find work or are not being paid on time, said Ramon Magsaysay award winner Bezwada Wilson on Wednesday. 
Mr. Wilson said that no one is employing daily-wage labourers and other Safai-Karmachari (manual scavengers) who have been rehabilitated in the recent past. “Some of them who have become vegetable sellers are not seeing a huge dip in their business due to loss of customers. People who have money now either buy things online or prefer to use cash for other things,” he noted. 
Dalits real sufferers
Mr. Wilson was in Hyderabad to address prison officials as part of a guest lecture at the Chanchalguda Central Jail. “The real sufferers of demonetisation are the poorest and the most marginalised like Dalits. Their lives have collapsed as people are getting a chance to tell them no and deny their daily earnings,” he asserted.
On manual-scavenging, Mr. Wilson said that though the Supreme Court had passed an order in 2014 to all State Governments to pay Rs. 10 lakh to families of people who died while working in sewers, only a few States had paid the amount so far. “Punjab has paid some families the amount. Recently, the Tamil Nadu Government told the Supreme Court that it cannot pay the amount, but finally agreed,” he added.

2016-11-23 00:00:00,YSRC wants TDP to take responsibility for demonetisation chaos,": The YSR Congress has demanded that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu own up the responsibility for the chaos created due to demonetisation and pull out from the NDA coalition instead of making efforts to appease the people.
Since the TDP happens to be a part of the NDA coalition, it owns responsibility for the sorry state of affairs. The Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues have no moral right to speak about demonetisation till steps are initiated to mitigate the suffering of the people, party spokesman Ambati Rambabu said.
The TDP took the credit for demonetisation claiming that Mr. Naidu had advised Prime Minister Narendra Modi on pulling out of the higher denomination notes. The party was trying to shift the blame to the Centre after the move backfired resulting in huge public outcry. “There is no point in criticising the Centre as long as the TDP continues to be an alliance partner of the NDA. It has to take the blame equally,” he said.
Referring to the alleged sale of shares of Heritage Group owned by Mr. Naidu’s family ahead of the announcement on demonetisation, he faulted Agriculture Minister P. Pulla Rao for trying to defend the move.
The Minister was speaking like spokesperson of the company or else how could anyone justify the significant rise in share price of the company in just two and a half years, he asked.",Hyderabad,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/YSRC-wants-TDP-to-take-responsibility-for-demonetisation-chaos/article16722389.ece,HYDERABAD
2016-11-23 00:00:00,"Post-demonetisation, marriage a knotty affair","Marriages at the time of demonetisation, marked by cash crunch and restriction on withdrawals from banks, are presenting hard times to families in the State.
Arun V. John, a young banker, is nervous as his marriage is drawing closer.
With just four more days for the wedding, it is the clearing of bills of the ceremony that worries him the most.
Though he had completed all major purchases earlier, he is struggling to raise funds to meet the expenses related to the wedding reception.
Meeting the bills of the caterer, the local guy who has erected shamiana, and at cake shop will be a tough call as their payments have to be made in cash, he said.
Similarly, V.K. Prasad, a former banker, whose daughter is getting married next week, is in a dilemma.
“The Reserve Bank of India’s condition that only one party in a marriage can withdraw Rs. 2.5 lakh from the bank has put me in a fix. If I withdraw money as suggested by the bank, it will inconvenience the bridegroom’s family,” said a worried Mr. Prasad. “One needs cash for meeting minor marriage expenses such as painting, home maintenance, and small purchases where online transactions are not possible,” he said.
The conditions would hit hard those who have raised loans and the amount had been transferred to their bank accounts after November 8, the day demonetisation was announced, he said.
Though most of the upmarket marriage halls in Ernakulam accept online payments, it is not the case with most of the medium-sized halls where payments are settled in cash.
At Pranavam Hall at Vennala, a medium-sized auditorium, all the bills have to be settled in cash.
The rent will come to Rs. 35,000, and another Rs. 10,000 has to be paid as tax. The setting up of the mandapam and stage decoration will cost Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 5,000 has to be paid for cleaning the hall, all in cash, explained manager K. Hariads. In some cases, cash cheques are accepted towards the booking charges, he said.
Nandini Menon, whose daughter is getting married on the first week of December, had planned the events well in advance before the financial crisis hit the market. However, the crisis caught hold of her when she went to collect the wedding dresses from the tailor.

2016-11-23 01:02:00,Demonetisation: Udupi Co-ops. Union to approach High Court," The Udupi District Co-operatives Union on Tuesday decided to approach the High Court of Karnataka on the issue of reduced cash inflow to cooperative societies in the district due to the Union government’s move to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. 
Jayakar Shetty Indralli, director of the union, said that all the members of the union had agreed to approach the High Court on this issue as they had exhausted all other options. 
Earlier, addressing a meeting of the office-bearers of all co-operative societies of the district, Kishan Hegde Kolkebail, president of the Udupi District Co-operatives Union Ltd., said that the co-operative societies were choking due to the Union government’s demonetisation move. 
The co-operatives union was not against the demonetisation move. But this had reduced the cash inflow at cooperative societies drastically and it had become difficult for them to carry out their day-to-day business. The cash inflow to the societies was just 0.9 per cent. 
After the government demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8, the union had directed all co-operative societies not to accept these denomination notes for either deposits or loan repayment. With the result, most of the business of the societies had come to a standstill. 
The constant change of guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on acceptance of currency notes had created an atmosphere of confusion. There were 53 agricultural credit co-operative societies and 253 credit co-operative societies in the district with over 3.75 lakh members. 
Most of the activities of the credit co-operative societies were concentrated in the rural areas. The societies were not able to provide services to the rural people after the demonetisation move. As money in circulation had gone down, loan repayment too was affected. 
For the last 12 days, it had become difficult for the societies to either provide money from the deposit-holders’ savings accounts. The District Co-operatives Union had approached both the Union and State governments and written several letters to them about the reduced cash inflow, but these attempts had not yielded any fruit. “All co-operative societies have enough funds to repay the depositors and there has been no Income Tax raids on any of the cooperative societies in the district. People should not get taken in by rumours,” Mr. Kolkebail said. 
S.K. Manjunath, Gopikrishna Rao, Chandrashekhar Shetty and Y. Sudhir Kumar, directors of the union, were present. ",Mangaluru,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/Demonetisation-Udupi-Co-ops.-Union-to-approach-High-Court/article16684262.ece,Udupi

2016-11-23 00:00:00,Demonetisation has hit primitive Bondas too,"Bondas of Malkangiri district of Odisha, considered to be one of most primitive tribes in the world, have started to get linked to banking process after demonetisation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes.
Along with this step towards development, they are also compelled to return to their ages old barter system due to dearth of currency notes. Bonda tribals, whose number is around 6,000, live in remote and isolated hilly region in the northwest of Machhkund river. Their remote habitat in Mudulipada and Andrahal panchayats of Khairaput block is called Bonda valley. They have till date tried to preserve their ancient culture and tradition.
Demonetisation has also affected lives of Bondas. During past years, efforts of administration and Bonda Development Agency (BDA) have brought in changes related to life and livelihood of these primitive tribals. Bondas had left behind their barter system of transaction and started using currency. According to sources, they store their currency notes, especially the ones of higher denomination, inside small tubular caskets made of bamboo. For their regular needs as well as to sell their forest produce, they travel around 14 kms to reach Khairaput market. They had been using mostly 500 and 1000 rupee notes that they were getting from traders for their cashew produce.
After demonetisation, Bonda tribals are facing some problem while making transactions in the Khairaput market. The old 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not accepted in the market. Thus they are now resorting to barter system. They are exchanging their tomatoes for salt or medicinal herbs for biscuit.
But along with it, they have also started to stand in queue in front of branches of State Bank of India (SBI) and Utkal Gramin Bank (UGB) at Khairaput to exchange their old currency notes or to get them deposited in their accounts.
When contacted, BDS project leader Manga Panna said after the demonetisation process, awareness of banking has increased among Bonda tribals. “They have now realised that banks can be the safest place for savings,” he added.
Mr Panna accepted that out of compulsion some Bondas are also resorting to barter system at Khairaput market. According to him link of Bondas will increase further once the proposed branch of SBI comes up at Mudulipada. According to him, a large number of Bonda families have bank accounts.

Srikakulam town has 14 bars and 29 liquor shops. As many as 232 liquor shops are functioning in 38 mandals of the district. Besides, there are a number of belt shops. Generally, the average sale of liquor per day in the district is Rs. 93 lakh and it has come down to Rs.35 lakh per day in the last one week.
In Srikakulam, major shops sell liquor worth around Rs.70,000 lakh per day and it has come down to Rs. 30,000 per day. Similar is the case with bars, the sale of which drops to Rs.40,000 from Rs.75,000.
“Though the cash crunch has been causing inconvenience, I am happy in one aspect that my husband could not buy liquor after withdrawal of big notes. He used to spend around Rs.150 per day on alcohol,” says Y. .Ramanamma, a resident of Mandala veedhi here. 
“We tried in vain to reform my husband by approaching de-addiction Centre in Visakhapatnam. But, demonetisation has its impact,” says L. Suseela, a villager of Pedapadu on the outskirts of Srikakualm town. 
Several women organisations such as Pragati Sila Mahila Sangham and Kinjarapu Jeevan Seva Foundation are of the view that violence against women would come down if liquor consumption is restricted due to demonetisation. 
According to physician Kutikuppala Suryarao, immunity levels improve among those who stop taking alcohol for three to four weeks. ",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-hits-liquor-sale/article16694994.ece,
2016-11-24 22:01:00,Tax on post-demonetisation deposits?," 
The Union Cabinet on Thursday night is believed to have discussed amending laws to levy close to 60 per cent income tax on unaccounted deposits in banks above a threshold post demonetisation of high-denomination currency notes.
The move comes amid banks reporting over Rs. 21,000 crore being deposited in zero-balance Jan Dhan accounts in two weeks after the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were banned, which authorities apprehend may be the laundered black money.
There was no official briefing on what transpired in the meeting that was called at short notice as Parliament is in session. Traditionally, there could no disclosures outside on any policy decision taken during the sitting of Parliament.
Sources said the government was keen to tax all unaccounted money deposited in bank accounts after it allowed the banned currency to be deposited in bank accounts during a 50-day window from November 10 to December 30.
There have been various statements on behalf of the government ever since the demonetisation scheme was announced on November 8, which has led to fears of the taxman coming down heavily on suspicious deposits that could be made to launder black money.
Officials have even talked of a 30 per cent tax plus a 200 per cent penalty on top of a possible prosecution in cases where black money holders took advantage of the 50-day window for depositing the banned currency.
Sources said the government plans to bring an amendment to the Income Tax Act during the current winter session of Parliament to levy a tax that will be higher than 45 per cent tax and penalty charged on black money disclosed in the one-time Income Disclosure Scheme that ended on September 30.
As for those black money holders who did not utilise the window, they would be charged a higher rate which could be close to 60 per cent that the foreign black money holder had paid in 2015.
Sources said the government is keen to root out benami deposits, particularly in Jan Dhan accounts.
There was also talk of the government imposing a limit on domestic gold holding, but it is not clear if the proposal was discussed at the Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday night.
The Cabinet meeting, summoned at a very short notice, comes amid reports of high tax penalty terrifying people from putting their cash savings in the formal banking system.
The sources said the government wants all of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 banknotes to be deposited and not burnt or destroyed for the fear of penal action.
The Income Tax Department had previously warned that cash deposits above Rs. 2.5 lakh threshold post demonetisation decision could attract tax plus a 200 per cent penalty in case of income mismatch.
It was stated that the department was tracking all cash deposited during the period of November 10 to December 30, 2016, above a threshold of Rs. 2.5 lakh in every account.
This had instilled fear in people with reports of the banned currency even being destroyed.
The sources added that the government may come out with a deposit scheme or an instrument like bond where the cash savings in the banned notes could be deposited.
A 50-day window was given to holders of the old currency to deposit in their bank accounts. But the penal tax provisions were deterring many.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Tax-on-post-demonetisation-deposits/article16695569.ece,New Delhi

Dr. Singh said that while he didn’t disagree with the objective of the government, a “monumental mismanagement has taken place.”
“Even supporters speak of the long run. Those who say demonetisation is good in the long run, should recall the quote: ‘In the long run, we are all dead’,” he said during the discussion on demonetisation,
. “I would like to ask the Prime Minister for examples of countries where people have deposited their money in banks and not allowed to withdraw their own money,” he observed.
The GDP could decline by three per cent. The scheme will hurt small industries. “It is no good that on each day banks bring out new notifications. It doesn’t reflect properly on the PMO, Finance Ministry and the RBI,” he remarked.
Dr. Singh said he “sincerely hopes the Prime Minister will find practical , pragmatic ways to relieve the suffering of the people.”",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-is-an-organised-loot-Manmohan-Singh/article16693025.ece,

2016-11-24 23:56:00,Central team arrives in State to assess impact of demonetisation," A three-member team of the Centre landed here on Thursday to assess the impact of demonetisation on people, particularly on the farming community.
The team headed by N. Sivasailam, Additional Secretary, Union Finance Department, called on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Cooperation Minister H.S. Mahadeva Prasad and held discussions on the impact of demonetisation on the State economy, particularly on the functioning of the cooperative sector.
Officials of the Cooperation Department briefed the team about the adverse impact of the Centre’s decision on the functioning of cooperative societies, milk unions, sericulture sector, agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), and the rural economy. Farmers are unable to repay loans to cooperative banks owing to scrapping of high value currencies, the officials told the team.
To get a feel of the ground reality, the team visited DCC Bank, milk cooperatives, and APMCs in Belagavi city and assessed their functioning, sources said.
The cooperatives have set a target of disbursing Rs. 1,068 crore to farmers between November, 2016 and January, 2017. Owing to shortage of currencies, cooperatives have not been able to grant or recover loans, officials told the team, sources said.

2016-11-24 00:41:00,Demonetisation: Revenue collection hit in Yadgir ," Land deals have come down significantly in Yadgir district after the demonetisation of high denomination currency. 
Sub-registrar offices, which used to be surrounded by crowds till November first week for registration of land deals and other transactions, are almost deserted now. Officials are doubtful about reaching even 25 per cent of the target set for the month for revenue collection from registrations. Of the Rs. 2.05 crore target set for the district, only Rs. 76.14 lakh has been collected till November 22. 
As many as 240 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 131 between November 9 and 22 at the sub-registrar office in Yadgir, Praveen Kumar Gogi, Senior Sub-Registrar, said on Wednesday. 
“The target for us for the month was Rs. 71 lakh, but just Rs. 37. 22 lakh has been collected so far,” he added. 
The situation is almost similar in other sub-registrar offices too. 
As many as 137 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 111 between November 9 and 22 at the Shahpur sub-registrar office, Mallesh Kobalkar, Sub-Registrar, said. Of the target of Rs. 78 lakh, Rs 25. 84 lakh had been collected so far. In Surpur, 85 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 43 between November 9 and 22, K.C. Chawan, Sub-Registrar, said. He said that though the target was Rs. 36 lakh, only Rs. 8.57 lakh had been collected. 
As many as 62 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 18 between November 9 and 22 at the Hunsagi sub-registrar office, sources said. The target was Rs. 20 lakh and Rs. 4.51 lakh had been collected so far, they added. 
According to the sources, revenue collection was favourable in October. A sum of Rs. 79.49 lakh was collected in Yadgir, Rs. 38.05 lakh in Shahpur; Rs. 28.73 lakh in Surpur; and Rs. 12.73 lakh in Hunsagi. 
Mortgage of properties, registration of sale deed, cancellation of agreements, deed of will, trust deed and other modes of registration were recorded in October. However, registration for properties was less this month owing to cash crunch. 
“We can’t do anything in such circumstances except to wait for another couple of weeks,” one of the village residents, whose land was kept for sale and put off owing to cash crunch, told The Hindu.

Addressing the protest meet, T.N. Srinivas, SDCC president, said that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance Government at the Centre made the demonetisation move without making proper preparation to face its consequences.
 Normal life has been badly disturbed owing to demonetisation and long queues at the banks for exchange of demonetised currency with new notes has become a common sight. 
Owing to restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash, the farmers are finding it difficult to arrange for money to pay wage to the labourers hired for harvest work. 
The traders are also deferring the purchase of agricultural produces from the farmers owing to cash crunch. 
This has resulted in decline in the prices of agricultural produce, he said.
The delay in recalibration of ATM kiosks for the new currency has aggravated the problem, he said, adding that it was unfortunate that the Union government has implemented the demonetisation in haste resulting in hardship for the common people.

Mandya, the largest milk producing district in the State, has 1,170 milk producers’ cooperative societies. Of this, around 50 per cent are all-women cooperative milk producers’ societies. As many as 1.12 lakh farmers supply at least 7.5 lakh litres a day to the Mandya Milk Manufacturers’ Union Ltd. (MANMUL).
On an average, each farmer supplies seven litres of milk a day to MANMUL through societies spread across the district. 
They are paid Rs. 27.30 for one litre (including the incentive of Rs. 4 and 80 paise for the society maintaining charges). Nevertheless, according to the suppliers, the ban of the two high-value currency has destabilised the financial activities of the societies.

2016-11-24 00:00:00,Impact of demonetisation hits milk producers too,"Milk producers across Mysuru district have not been spared from the impact of demonetisation.
The cooperative milk producers’ societies had been finding it difficult to pay producers once a week or 10 days upon getting payment to their respective bank accounts from the Mysore Milk Union owing to the ceiling fixed on cash withdrawal.
Since the withdrawal limit a week had been fixed at Rs. 24,000, the societies have been unable to withdraw sufficient cash to pay milk producers registered under it.
The producers’ are either given part payment or their consent taken to transfer money to their accounts if they don’t need the money immediately.
Though almost all the milk producers have bank accounts since the government subsidy of Rs. 4 a litre was directly credited to their accounts, the producers mostly prefer cash payments owing to limited banking facility.
Sources at the Mysuru Milk Union told The Hindu that the societies had been asked to manage the crisis locally and credit the producers’ payment to their accounts henceforth.
“Milk producers have been affected by the cash crisis. Each society gets at least Rs. 1 lakh a week as payment towards milk supply to the union. With the withdrawal limit being Rs. 24,000 a week, it is difficult to make payments to all,” the sources said.
About 89,580 milk producers are registered with the Mysuru union, which procures milk from them daily through the milk producers’ cooperative societies. Mysuru district alone has over 950 cooperative milk producers’ societies.
The union’s current daily milk procurement stands at 6.5 lakh litres. Production had been affected owing to drought and scarcity of fodder.
An officer at the Mysore Milk Union said that around Rs. 7 crore was paid to producers through their respective societies once a week or within 10 days. “By and large, cash transactions had been most preferred by the producers as many are averse to visiting banks for deposits or withdrawals. The currency crisis and restrictions in withdrawal for farmers’ cooperatives are being managed locally,” he said.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Impact-of-demonetisation-hits-milk-producers-too/article16723298.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-24 00:00:00,Demonetisation impact: Govt. unlikely to waive crop loans,"With demonetisation adversely impacting resource mobilisation, the government is unlikely to write off crop loans borrowed by farmers from the State-run cooperative banks.
Sources in the government told The Hindu that farmers had borrowed nearly Rs. 10,000 crore from various cooperatives across the State. Waiver of farm loans would adversely impact the State’s fiscal health and implementation of several subsidy schemes of the government.
It is learnt that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told arty legislators that it would not be economically viable to waive crop loans since the revenue collection is expected to dip by Rs. 15,000 crore in the current fiscal year (2016-17) owing to demonetisation of high denomination currencies.
In the post-demonetisation period, there had been a sharp decline in collection of taxes owing to dip in land registration and vehicle registration across the State. The real estate sector, which witnesses a lot of cash payments, had been hit hard by the Centre’s decision to ban high currency, sources said.
Moreover, the sources said the State’s committed expenditure, including salary and pensions, had shot up to Rs. 50,000 crore a year. Further, power subsidy bill is expected to touch Rs. 10,000 crore this year.
With rising government expenditure, the Chief Minister, who presided the Congress Legislature Party meeting here on Wednesday, told party MLAs and MLCs that it would not be possible to write off crop loans.
However, the sources said the government was exploring other options to provide sops to farmers hit hard by severe drought in 139 taluks.

2016-11-24 00:00:00,Demonetisation likely to take the shine off sahitya sammelan,"Demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 is likely to affect the 82nd Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelan scheduled for the first week of December in Raichur in more than one way.
As per well-placed sources closely associated with the literary event, the target of mobilising Rs. 2 crore from local sources cannot be met as the potential donors — businessmen, rice mill owners, traders and alike —themselves are in financial trouble.
“Businessmen usually donate in cash as they have huge unaccounted money which is normally in the form of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,00 notes. With the demonetisation of these high value notes, they are unable to make donations. They are not so generous to donate their accounted money through cheques and electronic transfer. The major source of fund mobilisation has thus dried up with the demonetisation,” an organiser said.
Sasikanth S.Senthil, Deputy Commissioner, who looks after the financial matters of the sammelan, is confident of organising the event with the funds provided by the State government. He is of the opinion that the Rs. 4 crore that the government had allocated was a “decent amount” for smooth conduct of the event. Considering demonetisation and resultant crunch in fund mobilisation, he has approached potential donors appealing to them to offer their contributions in the form of goods and services required for the event instead of cash donations.
“Hundreds of hotel rooms are booked for providing accommodation to guests. In the normal condition, we would have collected donations and pay for the rooms. Now, upon our request in view of demonetisation, the hotel owners have agreed to provide rooms for free. Other responsibilities and tasks that require money are being entrusted to many people,” Mr. Senthil told The Hindu .
Vishnukanth Budadi of Shilpa Medicare Limited and the Raichur Rice Millers Association have similarly agreed to provide food to guests and the people for three days, Mahantesh Maski, former district president of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat said.
In order to manage with limited financial resources, the organising committee is planning drop many proposals for cutting the costs. “We will have to use the funds judiciously. We will put money on unavoidable expenditure such as erecting stage and cultural teams. We may have to avoid providing jackets to mediapersons and other such expenditures,” Mr. Senthil said.
Using the surplus money after the sammelan, a Kannada Bhavan is normally built for the parishat at the town where sammelan is organised.

2016-11-24 13:03:00,Demonetisation: DMK to hold state wide protests on Nov 28 ,"
With CPI(M) deciding to observe November 28 as ‘All-India Protest Day,’ on the Centre’s demonetisation issue, DMK today said it would stage protests outside central government offices in the state on that day.
Party chief M. Karunanidhi said ‘opposition leaders’ — the Left parties — had decided to hold countrywide protests against the ruling BJP on the issue and that DMK will protest outside central government offices in Tamil Nadu.
“As far as DMK is concerned, massive protest demonstrations will be held outside central government offices in all the districts with the cooperation of the people,” he said in a statement.
He urged good participation by party workers and asked them to voice support against this “anti-people” move of the Centre.
Mr. Karunanidhi also lashed out at the Centre, saying the common man was severely suffering.
He criticised Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu for saying that demonetisation will not be rolled back, claiming it had further “complicated” the situation.

2016-11-24 01:16:00,Central teams get a feel of demonetisation heat,"The teams of officials despatched by the Centre to make a first-hand assessment of the ground reality post demonetisation met a cross-section of people across the State on Wednesday. 
One of the Central teams visited various villages in Tiruchi and Perambalur districts and listened to the grievances of farmers and traders. The team members also visited a few Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) in Tiruchi district and interacted with the farmers and account holders.
Praveen Kumar, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource and Development, gave a patient hearing to the farmers of Irungalur in Tiruchi district as they narrated the ordeal they have been forced to undergo due to the demonetisation. 
Almost all of them highlighted the undue delay in distribution of crop loans to the farmers. 
“Demonetisation has almost crippled the agricultural operations in villages. We totally depend upon co-operative societies for farm activities. Almost 15 days have passed since I applied for a crop loan of Rs. 75,000. However, officials refuse to entertain it citing a cash crunch,” said J. Sesuraj, a farmer. 
“The co-operative society has transacted no business for the past one week. It is open only today. I am not able to withdraw money,” said R. Perumal, an account holder of the society at Irungalur.
R. Saveriyar (73), who has deposited about Rs. 7 lakh in the same society, told Mr. Kumar that he was badly in need of at least Rs. 25,000 for undergoing an eye surgery. But, he could not withdraw it in spite of repeated attempts, as society officials had told him that there was no cash flow. 
Another farmer L. Robert Benjamin of Irungalur told Mr. Kumar that just 15 days were left for conducting the house-warming ceremony for his newly built house. 
“I need at least Rs. 50,000 for the function. But, I have withdrawn just Rs. 6,000 in the last three days. It is agonising,” he said.
Impact on SMEs
In Coimbatore, Union Urban Development deputy secretary M. Janaki had an interaction with the representatives of industries, farmers, milk producers and bankers for nearly 90 minutes. 
The small and medium-scale enterprises are dependent on the micro units to do job works. After demonetisation, these units are unable to pay wages. They do not have cash for day-to-day industrial activities. If the units are unable to supply components, the entire production chain will be hit. If the situation continues for another one week, industrial activity will be completely hit, MSME representatives warned. 
Vanitha Mohan, president, Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, said the cash crunch only seemed to be getting worse. “There is no point in giving Rs. 2,000 notes, as no one is able to use it. We need smaller denomination notes and they seem to be in short supply.” 
Southern India Mills’ Association chairman M. Senthil Kumar said the textile industry was hit on the retail and raw material fronts. 
“Cotton farmers are not bringing cotton to the market as they are unable to get cash payment for their produce. Winter sale is completely affected for the retailers. This has hurt the entire production continuum impacting the livelihood of thousands of people across the value chain,” he said.
Bankers said they were handling just about 10 per cent of the normal cash transaction. 
In Tirupur, officials briefed the team of the cash position in banks and explained the steps taken to calibrate the ATMs to dispense the new Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 notes. 
Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that the teams would submit a report to the Centre based on ground-level inputs on Friday.

2016-11-24 00:44:00,Demonetisation has put brakes on public transportation too,"The effects of demonetisation are felt in the public transport system too. The number of persons travelling by buses has dropped, giving a tough time for transport officials, who are now witnessing a fall in revenue. 
An official of the Vellore region of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) (Villupuram) Limited said that the revenue has gone down by at least 15 per cent. TNSTC, Vellore, operates 745 buses, including town buses. These buses ply to places including Chennai, Salem, Tiruchi, Villupuram and Bengaluru.
“We are now facing a reduction in collection. Our daily earning, on an average, is around Rs. 70 lakh. There is a decline of about 15 per cent in revenue since demonetisation was announced,” the official said.
Another official said the withdrawal of the two high denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit markets and businesses. “Likewise, it has affected public transport too. People either do not have sufficient money or lack lower denomination currencies. If they give Rs. 2,000 for a Rs. 100 ticket fare, where will our conductors go for change?” he asked.
A crew member of TNSTC also said the number of commuters has come down in the last two weeks. “Some of them pay using the old Rs. 500 note but conductors do not have change,” he added.
Private buses too face a similar problem. D. Vijaya Govindarajan, president of Vellore District Bus Owners Association, said passenger flow was low, resulting in dull days for private buses. There are nearly 300 buses that ply to various places within the district and neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvannamalai.

2016-11-24 03:24:00,Demonetisation divides Bihar alliance,"The Opposition parties may have closed ranks in Parliament against demonetisation, but in Bihar the ruling grand alliance members are singing different tunes. 
In a surprise move, Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar, has extended full support to the decision, while his alliance partners, the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), have opposed it vehemently. This has cast doubts on the strength of the alliance.
“Ours is a national party and we’re in the grand alliance government following decisions taken by our high command…if our leadership asks us to part ways with the State government, we’ll do it at once…we’re only committed to the Congress”, State Congress president Ashok Chaudhary said on Wednesday, while leading a protest march here.
Asked why the JD(U) was supporting the Central government’s decision, Mr. Chaudhary said: “Every political party has got the right to take its own decision on the issue…we’re with the decision of our high command and don’t care who says what.” 
Similarly, a few days back, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, senior leader of the RJD, the major partner in the ruling alliance, said that Mr. Kumar’s decision to support the demonetisation decision has “certainly cast a doubt on the unity of the grand alliance”.
“People are wondering whether he [Nitish Kumar] still has a soft corner for the BJP with whom he was earlier in alliance… but, we have been saying that the grand alliance is one and strong,” Mr. Singh told journalists.
However, reacting to Mr. Chaudhary’s strong statement, RJD leader and deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav said, “no such statement has come from the party’s central leadership…otherwise all political parties are free to have their own opinion on the issue…the statement does not have any effect on the grand alliance.”
JD(U) national general secretary K.C. Tyagi also took a similar stand.

2016-11-24 00:00:00,Demonetisation: Central team member flooded with complaints,"Central team member R. Subramanyam, a senior IAS officer and an additional secretary in the Union government, was flooded with complaints about the problems being faced by public due to non-availability of low denomination notes and restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from the banks following demonetisation in the district.
Mr Subramanyam was assigned to study the problems by the people due to demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. He interacted with a cross-section of people including farmers, womenfolk, RTC passengers, small-time traders, vegetable vendors and others in Gundlapalli village in Ganneruvaram mandal, Manakondur mandal and Karimnagar.
At Gandlapalli village, Mr Subramanyam visited the State Bank of India branch and inquired about the problems being faced by customers. A farmer suggested that the government should give instructions to banks to allow account holders to withdraw money without any restrictions. He said the release of only Rs. 2,000 notes was causing several hardships in getting change to provide wages to labourers. Enkavva, another customer, said that she had deposited an amount in the bank to meet the hospital expenses for the delivery of her daughter in a private hospital. But the bank was providing only Rs. 24,000 per week. She urged the authorities to provide the required amount at a time.
At Gattu Duddenapalli cooperative bank, the farmers found fault with the RBI for not allowing them to deposit and exchange Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes in cooperative banks. The farmers also said that the issuance of only Rs. 2,000 notes into the market was causing hardships in getting change and urged the government to release Rs. 500 notes immediately.
Welcoming the government’s decision, denizens of Karimnagar complained about restrictions in the withdrawal of only Rs 2,000 per day from ATM a and subsequent problem with the non-availability of change. They said that the problems would be solved if the government releases Rs. 500 notes.

2016-11-24 00:36:00,,"PANAJI: Rubbishing the claim of the Union government that terrorist activities have been hit hard by the demonetisation move, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Digvijaya Singh said here on Wednesday that the terrorists use digital currency like Bitcoin (currency largely used with ease to conduct unregulated transactions, across international borders) and demonetisation will hardly have any effect on terror activities.
The Senior Congress leader in-charge of Goa blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting poor Indians to hardship through an ill-implemented demonetisation.
“Most of the drug peddling and terror activities and illegal activities are now done through Bitcoin. It is dealt through different software and it is impossible to trace. Can the Prime Minister, government of India and particularly the NSA be so naive as to believe that terrorism can be eradicated by simply demonetisation,” Mr. Singh asked sarcastically at a press conference here during his visit to review the party’s preparedness for the Assembly elections next year.
Mr. Singh further said that the decision to demonetise currency would not impact terror activities at all, as is proved by the recent cash seizureby the army from a slain terrorist in Bandipore district in Jammu and Kashmir.
“New currency notes have been found in possession of certain terrorists in Kashmir Valley. Where did they get the currency notes from when common people are not getting these currency notes?” asked Mr. Singh.
Mr. Singh said that the party did not oppose demonetisation per se but was disappointed to see that BJP simply did not know how to govern and showed total lack of understanding about what kind of miseries it will inflict on common people by changing nearly 86 per cent of the currency notes in a currency-based economy like India.
He also lamented that because of thoughtless implementation of the scheme by the Central government, as many as 70 people lost their life out of shock and pain of standing in queues before banks for hours despite having money in bank but unable to spend it.
“All this could have been avoided,” said Mr. Singh. The government, he added, should have been aware that black money is primarily generated by non-payment of taxes and that cannot be eradicated by simply demonetising currency.
Mr. Singh also attacked the Goa BJP and the Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and accused them of striking deals with builders by introducing piece-meal changes in building rules favouring some builders. ",States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/article16689717.ece,

On the sidelines of Sangat Darshan programme in the Lambi Assembly segment here, the Chief Minister, when asked to comment on probability of the former BJP MP joining the the Congress, said Mr. Sidhu was “non-decisive” in joining any party due to his vested interests.
Mr. Badal said people who have “no stand” on any issue “are bound to go in political oblivion”.
He said people of the State have “strong disliking” for “opportunists and defectors, who backstab their mother party for sake of personal interests”.

On another query, the Chief Minister said anyone was free to contest election against anybody.
“However, one thing was crystal clear that security deposits of Lok Sabha MP and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann would be forfeited if he contests against Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal from Jalalabad,” he said.

He said November 25 would be an important day for the State as the Prime Minister would lay foundation stone for AIIMS at Bathinda.

2016-11-24 21:03:00,Rs. 10 lakh in demonetised currency seized at airport ," In what is considered to be an indication of the influx of withdrawn Indian currency back to the country in the wake of the demonetisation of high value notes, the Customs Air Intelligence Unit foiled a smuggling attempt and seized Rs. 10 lakh in the withdrawn denominations of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 at the Cochin International Airport on Thursday. 
Abdul Salam of Panoor in Kannur district was nabbed on his arrival from Dubai on Thursday around 9 a.m. 
Addressing a press conference, Customs Commissioner K.N. Raghavan said that the undeclared money had become worthless abroad owing to the demonetisation. 
The arrested person was only a carrier who had reportedly agreed to do the job for a commission of Rs. 20,000. He was intercepted by the Air Intelligence officers during the baggage checking. The notes were found concealed in a napkin package, tissue paper boxes and soap powder boxes. There was Rs. 7 lakh in Rs. 1,000 currency bills and Rs. 3 lakh in Rs. 500 bills. 
Salam had left for Dubai from the Kozhikode airport on November 20. The verification of his passport revealed that he was a frequent traveller to Dubai. Though he had been never caught before, Customs officials suspect that he had been active in smuggling activities. 
The officials also suspect the role of hawala channels behind the currency smuggling. The arrested person allegedly confessed that he had been asked to carry the consignment and hand it over to a person who would contact him outside the airport. He is learned to have revealed the name of the person who was supposed to receive the consignment. 
Customs officials said that even though the government had ordered foreign exchange agencies abroad to stop accepting withdrawn currency, it is learnt that some of the agencies are still accepting the notes at a 20 per cent reduced exchange rate. 
These notes are later sent to India to be exchanged for new bills. “We are interrogating the accused to extract information about other people involved in the activities,” Mr. Raghavan said. 
Customs has alerted the Reserve Bank of India, Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate about the seizure. Customs has registered a case against Salam for carrying money above the permissible limit. A passenger arriving from abroad should make a declaration at the airport if the amount they possess exceeds Rs. 25,000.",Kochi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/Rs.-10-lakh-in-demonetised-currency-seized-at-airport/article16695378.ece,KOCHI

2016-11-24 00:00:00,"Post-demonetisation, fisheries sector struggling to stay afloat","It’s stinking. To an urban nose, it is even nauseating. The stench of rotten fish mingles with the early morning breeze. Seagulls hover eyeing an easy catch as a gloomy dawn breaks at Beypore, one of Kerala’s major fishing harbours.
For hundreds of fish workers at the harbour, for whom the working day begins at 4 a.m., the stench hardly matters. They are sorting the catch that landed ashore last evening; crushing huge blocks of ice for use in freezers on board boats; loading nets, wire-ropes, water canisters, groceries and other essentials onto boats which are roaring to go out into the sea; and, unloading box after box of fish from boats that had returned from the sea after sundown. But, the harbour is half as busy as it was a fortnight ago—before the onset of the currency crisis triggered by demonetisation.
Mohammed Razik, a commission agent, is deeply worried. “I don’t know how to pay the ‘boys’ who are helping to unload the fish boxes from the boats,” he tells The Hindu .
“They need to be paid in cash on the spot after the work is over,” he says. Razik hardly has any cash in hand. He has money in the bank, but the Rs. 24,000 limit for this week has already been reached.
“If I don’t pay them at least a part of their wages, they may not show up for work tomorrow,” he says in anguish.
Dozens of commission agents (or Tharakans) like Mr. Razik, who operate at the Beypore fishing harbour and who are an important link in the largely informal fishery economy, are in deep trouble because of the scrapping of the high denomination notes.
The Tharakan has been a unique institution in Kerala’s fishery economy for a long time. He is a middle man between the fishermen and the fish buyer and he links the fish to the market. He finances the fishing trips. For his work, the Tharakan gets a commission—ranging from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of the value of the catch.
The Tharakan, sometimes dubbed an exploiter, oils the fishery economy with his cash liquidity. Almost the entire operation is in cash. “Without the help of the Tharakans, it is hard to run the fishery business,” says Murali, who is a co-owner of a fishing boat. “The Tharakans take care of all the day-to-day payments,” he says.
When the Tharakans’ cash flows dry up, the fishery economy dries up too. The cash-trapped Tharakan is now the symbol of the cash crunch facing the Beypore fishing harbour, which is home to around 450 boats. Because of the crunch, every single person involved in the hundreds of different tasks in fishing — the men who go on the boat, those who break ice blocks, the tea vendor, the lottery agent, the lorry drivers — are all affected badly.
“On average, 50 families rely on a single fishing boat for their livelihood,” points out K. Preman, the president of the Beypore Fishing Harbour Development Committee.
The lottery vendor rues that the fisherfolk, great believers in the luck factor, now turn their back on seeing him.
Nearly three-fourths of the workers on the sea-going boats at Beypore are migrant labour from Eastern India. “The mobile phone is the lifeline for them,” says M. Basheer, president of the Kozhikode district unit of the Fish Merchants and Commission Agents Association. “Now they are unable to pay even for the connection recharge.”",Kozhikode,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/Post-demonetisation-fisheries-sector-struggling-to-stay-afloat/article16723389.ece,BEYPORE (KOZHIKODE)

N. Periyasami, district secretary, Thoothukudi South, who led the programme, in Thoothukudi central, said the common people were the worst hit due to the demonetisation exercise as cash was out of reach for them. 
The demonetisation policy was implemented all of a sudden overnight and people had no alternative but to spend most of their time waiting in front of ATMs and banks to withdraw money and exchange demonetised notes. 
Many ATMs remained closed and some remained open without cash. Hence, normal life was affected everywhere as people did not have money in their pockets, he said. P. Geetha Jeevan, Thoothukudi MLA and others took part in the human chain. In Tiruchendur, the DMK-men led by MLA Anitha R. Radhakrishnan staged a similar protest opposite Tiruchendur bus stand. In Kovilpatti, the DMK cadres led by A. Subramanian, district secretary, Thoothukudi North, formed a human chain against demonetisation.

In Ramanathapuram, the agitation was led by former Minister Suba Thangavelan and participated among others by District secretary Suba Tha Diwakaran and former minister V. Sathiyamoorthy.
In Sivaganga, former ministers K. R. Periyakaruppan and M. Thennvan led the protest. 
Demand 
They demanded the centre to withdraw the demonetisation as all sections of the society, especially the poor and downtrodden faced trouble in view of severe cash crunch.
After withdrawing about 80 per cent of the currencies in circulation, the Centre failed to bring in new currencies and ease the situation, they said. 
The new 2000 rupee note was of no use to the public as they could not get change, they said. 
Slogans 
The protesters also raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting the people of the country in trouble. 
The party was not against the steps being taken to wipe out black money but was against subjecting the people to hardships, they also added. ",Madurai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/DMK-forms-human-chain-protesting-demonetisation/article16695868.ece,
2016-11-24 00:00:00,Central teams get a feel of demonetisation heat,": The teams of officials despatched by the Centre to make a first-hand assessment of the ground reality post demonetisation met a cross-section of people across the State on Wednesday.
One of the Central teams visited various villages in Tiruchi and Perambalur districts and listened to the grievances of farmers and traders. The team members also visited a few Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) in Tiruchi district and interacted with the farmers and account holders.
Praveen Kumar, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource and Development, gave a patient hearing to the farmers of Irungalur in Tiruchi district as they narrated the ordeal they have been forced to undergo due to the demonetisation.
Almost all of them highlighted the undue delay in distribution of crop loans to the farmers.
“Demonetisation has almost crippled the agricultural operations in villages. We totally depend upon co-operative societies for farm activities. Almost 15 days have passed since I applied for a crop loan of Rs. 75,000. However, officials refuse to entertain it citing a cash crunch,” said J. Sesuraj, a farmer.
“The co-operative society has transacted no business for the past one week. It is open only today. I am not able to withdraw money,” said R. Perumal, an account holder of the society at Irungalur.
R. Saveriyar (73), who has deposited about Rs. 7 lakh in the same society, told Mr. Kumar that he was badly in need of at least Rs. 25,000 for undergoing an eye surgery. But, he could not withdraw it in spite of repeated attempts, as society officials had told him that there was no cash flow.
Another farmer L. Robert Benjamin of Irungalur told Mr. Kumar that just 15 days were left for conducting the house-warming ceremony for his newly built house.
“I need at least Rs. 50,000 for the function. But, I have withdrawn just Rs. 6,000 in the last three days. It is agonising,” he said.

Impact on SMEs

In Coimbatore, Union Urban Development deputy secretary M. Janaki had an interaction with the representatives of industries, farmers, milk producers and bankers for nearly 90 minutes.
The small and medium-scale enterprises are dependent on the micro units to do job works. After demonetisation, these units are unable to pay wages. They do not have cash for day-to-day industrial activities. If the units are unable to supply components, the entire production chain will be hit. If the situation continues for another one week, industrial activity will be completely hit, MSME representatives warned.
Vanitha Mohan, president, Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, said the cash crunch only seemed to be getting worse. “There is no point in giving Rs. 2,000 notes, as no one is able to use it. We need smaller denomination notes and they seem to be in short supply.”
Southern India Mills’ Association chairman M. Senthil Kumar said the textile industry was hit on the retail and raw material fronts.
“Cotton farmers are not bringing cotton to the market as they are unable to get cash payment for their produce. Winter sale is completely affected for the retailers. This has hurt the entire production continuum impacting the livelihood of thousands of people across the value chain,” he said.
Bankers said they were handling just about 10 per cent of the normal cash transaction.
In Tirupur, officials briefed the team of the cash position in banks and explained the steps taken to calibrate the ATMs to dispense the new Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 notes.
Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that the teams would submit a report to the Centre based on ground-level inputs on Friday.

2016-11-24 00:00:00,‘Demonetisation will not achieve stated objectives’,"A panel of economists who met at the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) to discuss the demonetisation policy of the central government said that the stated objectives of the policy will not be fulfilled.
“Essentially, collectively, the panellists have made the following points — that....we are certain that the stated intentions of the government will not be served well,” said Venkatesh B. Athreya, summarising the discussion on behalf of his three co-panellists.
The session, called Understanding Demonetisation: Issues and Challenges, was held at a packed Adiseshiah Auditorium and moderated by C. Lakshmanan of MIDS.
The panellists’ interaction with the audience was disrupted multiple times due to arguments between supporters and critics of the policy.

Demand crash

“What we are saying is that, there is both — pain now, and absolutely no prospect of realising the intentions in the medium or long run,” said Mr. Athreya.
He said that more data was needed before making forecasts about the economy. “We can definitely say that, in the short term, there will be a demand crash, in the medium term, there will be a production scarcity,” he said, warning that inflationary tendencies would result.
“The declared objectives may not have been the real objectives — that is the speculation,” said Mr. Athreya, who assigned political motives to the Prime Minister’s announcement.

RBI governor’s role

“There used to be an institution called the RBI in this country. Its Governor is the most invisible person today,” he said.
“All of us have said enough that the moves made by the government lack credibility. We have cast enough doubt on the motives of the government,” said S. Subramanian, formerly with MIDS, who termed the move an unqualified disaster. “Ultimately, what we are guaranteeing is a redistribution of wealth from actual defaulters to a set of either the same defaulters or a set of potential defaulters,” he said.

Impact on farmers

S. Janakarajan, also with MIDS, said that the policy had affected farmers and its impact would manifest itself in subsequent seasons, leading to food inflation.
He said the informal sector would bear the brunt of the move, citing interactions with ragpickers on the East Coast Road over the past fortnight.
Jothi Sivaganam, head of the department of economics at the University of Madras, said that the government was resorting to carpet bombing, instead of a surgical strike to target unaccounted wealth.
“We are squeezing liquidity because of the government’s constraints in supplying currency,” he said.

He also urged it to take immediate steps to ease the situation.
“Instead of five percent, who should be the target, now 95 per cent of the people are suffering,” he said. The TMC also demanded that all co-operative banks be given the power to exchange the withdrawn currency. The party also appealed for the extension of the November 24 deadline for using the withdrawn banknotes at various outlets by a month.

2016-11-24 23:40:00,Narayanasamy leads protest against demonetisation," The Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Thursday staged demonstrations to condemn the Centre’s decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. 
The PCC organised a demonstration in front of the post office on Thursday to protest the Centre’s decision. They shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting public to hardship in the name of fighting corruption.
Addressing the protesters, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said the decision by the Prime Minister to demonetise higher denomination currency notes would not help in curbing black money. Instead, he said, it would only create hardship to the public and destabilise the economy.
People were finding it difficult to meet their daily expenses. Farmers across the country were facing resource crunch to carry out farming. 
The value of rupee had come down after demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. 
Mr. Narayanasamy questioned the Prime Minister’s rationale of not attending the Parliament when the House had taken up for discussion the demonetisation issue. 
“The Congress is not against any decision to fight black money. But the decision of the Union Government had caused difficulty to the common people and will hurt economic growth. The Congress will continue to raise the inconvenience caused to the public,” he said.
The demonetisation issue, he said, would propel the Congress back to power at Centre as the public had realised the folly of electing the BJP to power. 
Minister for Public Works and PCC president A. Namassivayam said the common man had been largely affected by the Centre’s decision to demonetise high-value currency. The decision was taken without proper planning, he added. 
Minister for Revenue M.O.H.F. Shahjahan, Minister for Social Works M. Kandasamy, Minister for Electricity R. Kamalakannan, PCC functionaries, and DMK leader S.P Sivakumar participated in the demonstration.
Human chain
Later, DMK organised a human chain covering most parts of the town. The party cadre shouted slogans against the Prime Minister and the NDA government.
Chief Minister and PCC chief also joined the DMK cadres in the human chain.
‘Normality soon’
Meanwhile, a senior official with a private bank said the situation had improved drastically and by month end most of ATMs would be recalibrated. Now, the rush was for depositing money and withdrawal of cash unlike in the beginning when people queued up to exchange notes, he added.

R. Viswanathan, Secretary of CPI, said the Centre had failed to curb black money as it continued to exist in foreign banks, as investments in gold and stock exchanges.

‘Common man worst hit’

The sudden withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had inconvenienced the people.
The common man, especially daily wage workers, small vendors, and retail traders had been severely affected and are unable to buy medicines and other essential commodities to meet their daily requirements.
The rural economy had been badly hit because of the move since farmers had not been able to purchase seeds and fertilisers.
Mr. Viswanathan demanded that the public be allowed to make transactions using the old notes to meet their daily expenses until alternative arrangements were put in place.
The party called for increasing the daily withdrawal limit and ensuring sufficient supply of currency notes in all ATMs.
The CPI will stage demonstrations in front of banks at 11 centres, including Ariyankuppam, Muthialpet, Lawspet, Villianur, and Bahour protesting against the demonetisation move.

FADA president John Paul stated in a press release that the situation of retail sector was much more alarming than the dealer community has anticipated. The entire auto retail trade has come under severe stress.
The FADA realised that the situation was transitional and would ultimately normalise and probably be better than now. However, most of the dealerships were saddled with stocks and near zero retail. The situation was unlikely to see much improvement till the end of the financial year, he said.
As a consequence, it seems unlikely that a majority of dealerships would be in a position to honour their commitments to banks and financial institutions.
To tide over the crisis, Mr. Paul urged the vehicle manufacturers to come up with their support to reduce inventory at the dealerships and to make available enhanced credits from banks to the dealers. The banks should also come forward to increase vehicle and personal loan limits for the customers, including 100 per cent on-road funding for vehicle purchases.

2016-11-25 16:12:00,Weddings in the time of demonetisation ,"The demonetisation of the 500- and 1000-rupee notes in India, and the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. elections — ironically, within hours of each other on November 8-9 — started off a week marked by disbelief. And then, as if to just rub it in, came the widely-publicised wedding of former Karnataka minister and mining baron G. Janardhan Reddy’s daughter Brahmani that reportedly rang up a bill of Rs. 550 crore.
Even though the Income-Tax authorities have started investigating the source of the Reddy wedding’s funding, there’s a fact we cannot ignore: All the world loves a wedding.
That is why a minuscule part of the Indian populace willingly suspended disbelief to enjoy three days of fabricated grandeur on the grounds of the Bangalore Palace, as the majority queued up outside banks and ATMs to exchange their now-useless 500- and 1000-rupee notes.
How does one balance an economy that runs on the steam of ostentation and parental one-upmanship, with the one that runs households?
The wedding industry in India is worth Rs. 100,000 crore, and is growing at 25 to 30 per cent annually, according to retail.franchiseindia.com. A few days of revelry can provide business opportunities for everyone from online and offline matchmakers, to event organisers, travel agents, caterers, beauticians, flower sellers and invitation card designers.
Weddings have always been celebratory in mood. But somehow, over the years, drip-fed by popular culture and super-sized expectations, they have become an outlet for showing off. Parents take out mortgages and huge loans or sell property to finance weddings in India, because they don’t want to be judged for their lack of spending power.
Gone are the days when a typical Indian wedding used to be a home-based function with just a few priests and relatives attending. The bridal trousseau used to have a limited number of clothes, jewels and vessels, and perhaps, some furniture.
The contrast today couldn’t be greater. Even in a non-celebrity wedding, the venue has to look like a film set, or the boudoir of a fairytale princess; the videography is done on manual and drone cameras; the clothes for the bride, groom and their respective families have to be the latest in wedding couture; and, of course, for those who can be brow-beaten into it, the gifting of a vehicle to the newly-weds is a must.
In the wake of demonetisation, it is thought that the luxury sector (of which weddings have become a major part in India), may take the worst hit. Reports from across the country have thrown up surreal situations. Wedding hosts are mulling gifting demand drafts to guests in place of the now-defunct Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, and cutting down on pre-wedding parties.
‘Wedding withdrawals’ of Rs. 2.5 lakh for families with impending nuptials have been approved by the Reserve Bank of India, but with stiff conditions. More seriously, daily-wage earners in the wedding industry’s ancillary fields — tent builders, stage adorners, processional bands, and so on — are facing unemployment because of the cash crunch.
Whether we like it or not, demonetisation may inevitably force us all to cut down on the pomp and spectacle that accompanies modern-day weddings, and, perhaps, make us reflect on the true sanctity of marriage.",Society,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/society/Weddings-in-the-time-of-demonetisation/article16700418.ece,
2016-11-25 18:34:00,Rahul dares Modi to participate in demonetisation debate,"Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Friday continued his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his “absence” in the ongoing winter session of Parliament by asking the latter what was he scared of. Mr. Gandhi dared Mr. Modi to participate in the debate in Parliament on demonetisation to clarify everything.
The Prime Minister had “laughed” at the misery of people post-demonetisation (during his visit to Japan earlier this month) and become emotional while speaking on the issue, Mr. Gandhi told reporters on the Parliament premises,.
“Let’s see what emotions appear on his face when he comes to the Lok Sabha,” Mr. Gandhi said. “The main issue is that the Prime Minister doesn’t come to the Lok Sabha for discussion. The moment he comes to Lok Sabha, doodh ka doodh, paani ka paani ho jayega (everything will be clear).
“The Prime Minister doesn’t want to sit in the Lok Sabha. We have been stopped from speaking in the Lok Sabha. What you are you scared of ?” Mr. Gandhi asked.
Taking a dig at the Prime Minister over him addressing the Global Citizen Fest nearly a week ago, Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister can address “pop concerts” but doesn’t attend discussion on demonetisation in Parliament.
''The moment discussion takes place in the Lok Sabha in the presence of Mr. Modi, it will become clear who the Prime Minister had allegedly told about in advance about the November 8 move,'' he said
Mr. Gandhi alleged that BJP leaders were aware of the move.
Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma reiterated the Opposition’s demand for Mr. Modi’s presence in Parliament during the demonetisation debate, saying that accountability had to be fixed for the chaos and the financial anarchy caused due to the move.
“The Prime Minister has to come [to Parliament). He has to explain. Accoutability has to be fixed...for the chaos and the financial anarchy. Prime Minister is also answerable and so is the RBI governor,” Mr. Sharma said.
The demonetisation move ''is an undeclared financial emergency.” The government needs to explain under which law it has put a curb on the withdrawal of “people’s own hard earned money“.
“Who authorises them...under which provision of the law they have [imposed withdrawal limit] . . .what is happening in the country is that people have been denied access to their own hard-earned money. No country in the world will allow such a situation to arise which has happened in our country,” he said.
Reiterating the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe the issue, he described demonetisation as a “big scam” and suggested that there was a big surge in bank deposits in September as the information about the move was “selectively leaked.”",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Rahul-dares-Modi-to-participate-in-demonetisation-debate/article16701365.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-25 18:27:00,BJP leaders bought property before demonetisation: Cong.,"Mounting a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress on Friday said leakage of demonetisation decision had helped BJP leaders buy property by converting their black money through various means a few months before it was announced.
Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge accused the Prime Minister of “selective leakage” of demonetisation move to his own partymen, who converted their black money through property and other avenues.
“This shows who are the real supporters of black money,” he told reporters outside Parliament House.
Mr. Kharge said democracy functions through discussion and asked the Prime Minister to participate in the debate in Parliament on the issue if he believed in democratic values.
“If the Prime Minister believes in democracy, he should come to Parliament and participate in the debate and answer the concerns raised by the opposition on the demonetisation issue.
“You think you are a ‘samrat’ (king) and the country runs on the diktat of the ‘samrat’ Instead of speaking outside, you should come to Parliament and speak,” he said.
On the Prime Minister not speaking inside Parliament, he said, “If he speaks like this, he knows he could face privilege and contempt.” 
Terming demonetisation as the “biggest scam”, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also accused Modi of leaking the demonetisation move to top BJP leaders, alleging they bought land using their black money.
The party released a list of some BJP leaders who allegedly bought 8 land parcels worth Rs 3.41 crore in Bihar in the run up to the November 8 demonetisation move.
Mr. Surjewala, flanked by Congress spokespersons Rajiv Gowda and Sushmita Dev, alleged that post expose of deposit of money in bank accounts of BJP leaders just before the demonetisation, “documents now prove” that BJP leaders bought the land.
“Modiji’s mask of fighting black money is off. Stop mocking the people of India and Parliament and look in the mirror. Make all BJP accounts public and tell the details of all property purchased by BJP leaders over the last one year and the truth of demonetisation scam will be out,” he said.
“Layers of demonetisation scam are getting unearthed by the day as a series of BJP transactions get exposed.
Demonetisation is emerging as the biggest scam that needs to be probed through JPC and responsibility fixed,” Mr. Surjewala said. ",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/BJP-leaders-bought-property-before-demonetisation-Cong./article16701351.ece,New Delhi 
2016-11-25 13:27:00,Fracas mars Supreme Court hearing on demonetisation,"A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur said on Friday that the judiciary will “certainly” hear the ground realities and weigh the constitutionality of the November 8 RBI notification scrapping the high-denomination currency notes.
The court’s assurance came as random accusations of “maximum cash has gone into BJP hands” and “people are starving on the roads” overawed decorum at the hearing, with the Bench urging lawyers to maintain the dignity of the court.
In a much-anticipated hearing on the demonetisation issue, the apex court said it would comprehensively hear arguments on various questions raised in the issue on December 2. These include the hardships caused by demonetisation, the transferring of petitions filed in the various High Courts to Delhi, whether these petitions should be heard by the Delhi High Court or the Supreme Court itself, the constitutional validity of the RBI notification of November 8, and finally, whether the issue should be referred to a Constitution Bench.
In this, the Bench accepted the suggestion of the government that it was better to hear the demonetisation issue in its totality on December 2 rather than in a piecemeal fashion.
Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi submitted that the government's petition to transfer all demonetisation-related cases from other High Courts to the National Capital was already scheduled for hearing on December 2. In that case, the four separate petitions — listed today for hearing on Friday — should also be heard on the same day, Mr Rohatgi said, as this would ensure that the court takes an informed decision after considering all aspects of the issue.









 
Chaotic scenes
The morning’s hearing began with senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for a petitioner, claiming that “people were starving on the roads.”
“Nobody is starving on the roads,” Mr. Rohatgi said, dismissing the claim peremptorily.
“The markets are closed,” Mr. Sibal shot another barb at the demonetisation exercise to weed out black money.
At this point, advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, who claims that the new Rs. 2000 bank notes bleed easily and can be faked, wrested the floor from Mr. Sibal, claiming “all the banks are closed”.
“Maximum cash has gone into BJP hands,” Mr. Sharma declared as shouts of protest erupted inside the court. Then lawyers vied with each other, raising their hands for the court's attention as pandemonium seemed imminent.
Chief Justice Thakur, on the Bench along with Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, had maintained silence all through. But as the shouting continued, he Chief Justice reined in the confusion by issuing a stern warning that the court would adjourn the hearing by another six weeks unless order was restored immediately.
“Everyone is shouting with their hands over the other's shoulder. This is a courtroom and there is some decorum to be observed here. We will adjourn the case for hearing after the vacation,” Chief Justice Thakur addressed the crowded courtroom.
“There are some really serious issues here, My Lords,” Mr. Sibal interceded.
“If there is a difficulty, you tell us what the problems are,” Chief Justice Thakur addressed the senior lawyer.
“There is a lot of inconvenience. They don't have the capacity to print the new currency... what are they going to do?” Mr. Sibal said.
“If you want us to look into it... We will certainly do... But we will hear all. We cannot hear this issue piecemeal,” Chief Justice Thakur said, refusing Mr. Sibal's plea to advance the hearing to next Tuesday.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Fracas-mars-Supreme-Court-hearing-on-demonetisation/article16699801.ece,NEW DELHI

“About four-lakh people have lost their jobs after the demonetisation,” he told reporters.
The CPI (M) leader added that 32 million people have not been paid their wages.
He pointed out that as many as 16 notifications had been brought out by the Centre on this issue till now.
Mr. Yechury also took to twitter to claim that the move was adversely affecting people, sharing a newspaper report that said this was the immediate number of people, mostly daily wage labourers, out of employment in sectors like garments, leather and jewellery.
He shared a report claiming India had the lowest ATM density among BRICS nations, at 18 ATMs per one lakh population.
Mr. Yechury tweeted to elaborate his point, sharing 2014 data on ATM density in India, compared to other BRICS nations. India ranked last with just 18 ATMs per one-lakh people.
“Digital payments, ATMs, rural banking, cash transactions. Well, facts don't matter when one man gets a brainwave,” he said.
He tweeted just before this: “In Modi govt, 1.12-lakh crore loans waived, 1% Indians have 58.4% of wealth, millions of jobs lost. To distract, demonetisation disaster.”

2016-11-25 00:00:00,Demonetisation brings temporary relief to powerloom workers,"The demonetisation move has brought temporary relief to the cash-starved workers of the powerloom industry in the Nagari Assembly constituency.
Spread over the Nagari and Puttur municipalities, over 35,000 families depend on the cloth manufacturing cottage industry. The industry is dominated by about three dozen influential families managing a workforce of nearly 20,000 at their looms in Satrawada, Chintala Patteda, Kothapeta and Ekambarakuppam in Nagari bordering with Tamil Nadu and Gate Puttur in Puttur town. Interestingly, the families living in TN villages of RK Peta and Poddutur Peta near Nagari also work in the looms. Till two decades ago, the industry registered multi-crore growth but the hay days had gradually declined. Still, the industry has a thumping presence and is all set to albeit slowly recover from its drooping fortunes. Most of the families are dependent on the patronage of their bosses. The cloth is exported to Mumbai, Chennai, Surat and other cities in the north. Immediately after the demonetisation was announced, the workers in the big units heaved a sigh of relief. Each worker on an average gets a weekly wage between Rs 2000-3000. The workers at Ekambarakuppam said though the norm is weekly payment, they are paid once in three months, and that too in small amounts. Sometimes, the payments would be pending for over six months and the owners would shell considerably big amounts during the festivals — with a promise to settle the balances at the earliest — to ward off unrest. However, during the last two weeks, the owners have embarked on a massive mission of collecting the bank passbooks and ATM cards of the workers and depositing amounts ranging between Rs 1 lakh and 2.5 lakhs in each account. Instead of at one go, the amount was said to have been deposited over four or five slots. A family at Satrawada on condition of anonymity said two of their members work in a powerloom and wages to the tune of Rs 1.5 lakhs had been pending to them since four months. “We were given Rs. 2 lakh each in three slots to deposit the amounts in our accounts. Our passbooks and ATMs were kept in their [owners] possession. In return, we were given Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 demonetised currency to the tune of Rs. 10,000 each. We are trying our level best to exchange the scrapped notes by travelling in APSRTC buses and at petrol bunks. Something is better than nothing. Apart from this, we have been getting the demonetised currency as our wages since a week. This we are again keeping with us, trying to exchange in various modes. Otherwise, we will again deposit them in our accounts. Withdrawals from our accounts have already commenced [by our owners]. Our signatures had been taken on the withdrawal forms.”

True, says official

A bank official in Nagari said it was true that huge amounts were being deposited in the accounts of the workers and in most cases the stipulation of Rs 2.5 lakh was adhered to.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-brings-temporary-relief-to-powerloom-workers/article16724287.ece,CHITTOOR
2016-11-25 22:53:00,Milk producers in HK region feel demonetisation heat," With district central cooperative banks running short of valid currency caused by demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, coupled with the government-imposed limit on the amount of transactions in banks, over 41,000 small milk producers across the rural areas of Hyderabad Karnataka region are forced to manage their households without payment for the last two weeks. 
Though the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Ltd (KMF) is making payments to societies online as usual, the milk societies that procure milk at village level are unable to make weekly payments to milk suppliers.
Kalaburagi Milk Union, under which Bidar, Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts fall, procures around 57,000 litres of milk a day from around 10,700 farmers and makes payments to milk suppliers on weekly basis. However, it could not make payments — about Rs. 1 crore a week — farmers for the last two weeks. 
“As per the Union government, a person or cooperative society can draw maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week. It is insufficient to make payments to all milk suppliers. The milk societies have therefore stopped payments to farmers for the last two weeks. I have been receiving a number of calls on the payment-related grievances and rushing to those places for redressing them,” Manohar Kulkarni, deputy manager, Kalaburagi Milk Union, told The Hindu on Friday. 
DCC bank officials were saying that the issue of currency shortage would hopefully be resolved by Monday, he said. 
Some milk societies that had adopted online mode of payment to their suppliers well before the demonetisation are at ease. But their number is too small. As per the information provided by KMF officials, of 355 functional milk cooperative societies under Kalaburagi Milk Union, only 15 have adopted online mode of payment. 
Upon the pressure from the Ballari Milk Union, which procures over 2 lakh litres of milk a day from around 30,500 milk farmers spread across 605 unions in Ballari, Koppal and Raichur district, Ballari DCC Bank has taken up an account opening drive among milk producers so as that it can disburse the payments online.
“If all the milk producers have their back accounts in rural district cooperative bank, their payment can be made through online transfer. But, they have bank accounts in various nationalised banks and DCC banks don’t have facility of Real Time Gross Settlement. Upon our request, they have now started bank account opening drive among milk farmers so that they could make online payments within next two months,” Marulu Siddappa, Assistant Manager at Ballari Milk Union told The Hindu.
In some societies, milk farmers without bank account are advised to open accounts so that their dues and future payments can be made online. ""Opening a bank account is a tiresome job for them as bank staff are busy with exchanging demonetised notes working overtime,"" said an officer. 
DCC banks plead helplessness in the matter. “Even if we have enough currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 100 or lesser denomination, we cannot allow milk cooperative societies to draw more than Rs. 24,000 a week as per the government directions,” Sidramareddy Patil, chairman of Kalaburagi DCC Bank, told The Hindu. 
If there were no restrictions, he added, there would be a good recovery of loans in the banks. 
KMF officials criticise the Union government for not exempting cooperative societies from restrictions of money transactions at banks. “At least now, the government should either exempt the cooperative societies from transaction restrictions or allow them to draw such amount of money that they require for clearing dues to milk suppliers every week,” Nagappa, an officer working with KMF in Bidar said.

2016-11-25 01:04:00,Manmohan calls demonetisation a ‘monumental disaster’,"Opening the attack on the government for its decision to scrap the high-value Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, former prime minister Manmohan Singh told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday that ‘50-days’ was like a torture that could have a disastrous effect on the poor and the deprived. He termed the implementation of the demonetisation a case of “organised loot and legalised plunder.” 
Describing the exercise as a “monumental disaster,” Dr. Singh said the decision could lead to the GDP declining by two percentage points. “This is an underestimate and not an overestimate,” he said.
Squarely putting the blame on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who attended the House for the first time since the winter session commenced and also the first time since he announced demonetisation on November 8, he said, “The ordinary people have suffered as a result of this imposition on the country overnight by the PM.” 
Referring to John Maynard Keynes, an influential British economist of the 20th centu- ry on Mr. Modi’s call to wait for 50 days, Dr. Singh said, “I am reminded of John Key- nes, who once said ‘In the long run, we are all dead’.” 
‘Govt. must take action’
Later he told The Hindu that the government should “reflect” on his speech in Parliament for answers on how to move ahead. 
“It is for the government to reflect on what we have said in Parliament. It is not for me to say what they should do, the government must take action,” he said on his six-minute speech in the House. 
Dr. Singh added that “all governments have considered [demonetisation measures] from time to time,” but declined to add why he had rejected the idea during his tenure. When asked why he had used strong terms like “organised plunder” and “legalised loot”, Dr. Singh said, “Well that is what the common people feel, they feel that way.”
Deaths in the queue
Earlier, Dr. Singh opened the discussion on demonetisation as soon as the Rajya Sabha resumed operations at noon as Prime Minister Narendra Modi walked in at 12 noon, amid hoots by the Opposition benches. 
The debate resumed by suspending the Question Hour. 
He asked the Prime Minister to name “any country he may think of where people have deposited their money in the bank but they are not allowed to withdraw their money,” which alone “is enough to condemn” what has been done in the name of greater good of the people.
“It is no good that every day the banking system comes with modification of the rules, the conditions under which people can withdraw money. That reflects very poorly on the Prime Minister's Office, on the Finance Minister's Office and on the Reserve Bank of India. I am very sorry that the RBI has been exposed to this sort of criticism, which, I think, is fully justified,” Dr. Singh said.

2016-11-25 10:09:00,Those criticising govt. were not ready for demonetisation: Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hit out at the critics of the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000, saying that those accusing the government of not being prepared for demonetisation were themselves not ready for the move. “If they had got even 72 hours, they would have praised me. We have taken a very big decision,” he said at a function in Parliament’s library building to release new editions of the Constitution of India on the eve of Constitution Day.
The Prime Minister claimed strong public support for his move, saying, “the common citizen of India has become a soldier against corruption and black money. Every person has a right to spend his or her money. No one can take anyone's money.” He made a strong pitch for the use of electionic transactions in preference to cash exchanges. “Now people can spend through mobile technology also,” he said. 
According to senior government sources,Mr. Modi, during Thursday’s Cabinet meet, urged the ministers to run a campaign to encourage electronic transfers of money. 
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley too, in a video conference with banking heads, urged that banks should encourage as far as possible, the use of debit cards among their customers in preference to taking out currency.
Mr. Modi, in his speech on Friday, pointed out that India was often ranked low in global rankings on corruption. “We need to improve it,” he said.

2016-11-25 22:13:00,Cash-driven ancillary units affected by demonetisation ," The impact of demonetisation on ancillary units in the unorganised sector is likely to have a cascading impact on registered manufacturing units in the long run. 
While there are no accurate records of the number of such units in Mysuru — since they are not registered and hence officially “illegal” — they are the backbone of medium and small scale units in the region as they provide services at throwaway rates.
Sources in the industries told The Hindu that the bulk of such ancillary units raised funds through informal sources on a daily or weekly basis at a higher rate of interest. But their source and money supply had evaporated consequent to demonetisation. Though this is reckoned to be a temporary phase, the impact is beginning to be felt and will affect all manufacturing units in Mysuru, according to Suresh Kumar Jain, secretary, Mysore Industries Association. 
He said the units which flourished in the unorganised sector include printing, welding, lathe workshops, carpentry, electrical wiring, automobile repair shops, and food processing units where transaction is by cash and workers are paid daily.
“With cash crunch extending for almost two weeks, daily wage workers are unable to sustain themselves. In addition, there is a withdrawal limit of Rs. 24,000 a week, which is inadequate for the entrepreneur,” Mr. Jain said. In the absence of registration, institutional finance by way of bank loans are not extended to such units and thus, the impact of demonetisation is greater on them. 
According to Sudhakar Shetty, vice-president, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, there are not less than 12,000 MSME units in the unorganised sector in Mysuru district, employing nearly a lakh people at a conservative estimate.
 “Daily wagers are not paid in cheques and most have no accounts for money transfer. This transition period is very painful,” Mr. Shetty said. 
As many entrepreneurs in the micro units do not operate through banks, they do not have overdraft facility or cannot avail themselves of advances available for registered industries. Meanwhile, the MIA is trying to extend assistance to enable them to open bank accounts to bring them to mainstream.
Medium and large scale units where payment is through cheques and electronic form have not been affected. ",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Cash-driven-ancillary-units-affected-by-demonetisation/article16702061.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-25 00:00:00,Central team arrives in State to assess impact of demonetisation,"A three-member team of the Centre landed here on Thursday to assess the impact of demonetisation on people, particularly on the farming community.
The team headed by N. Sivasailam, Additional Secretary, Union Finance Department, called on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Cooperation Minister H.S. Mahadeva Prasad and held discussions on the impact of demonetisation on the State economy, particularly on the functioning of the cooperative sector.
Officials of the Cooperation Department briefed the team about the adverse impact of the Centre’s decision on the functioning of cooperative societies, milk unions, sericulture sector, agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), and the rural economy.
Farmers are unable to repay loans to cooperative banks owing to scrapping of high value currencies, the officials told the team.
To get a feel of the ground reality, the team visited DCC Bank, milk cooperatives, and APMCs in Belagavi city and assessed their functioning, sources said. The cooperatives have set a target of disbursing Rs. 1,068 crore to farmers between November, 2016 and January, 2017.
Owing to shortage of currencies, cooperatives have not been able to grant or recover loans, officials told the team, sources said. Following widespread drought, farmers have been worst affected by the Centre’s decision, the officials told the team members.

In a joint press note, the INTUC, CITU, AITUC, and AIUTUC said appropriate compensation should be given to the families of those who died due to this “ordeal.” 
The unions have asked workers and their trade unions, irrespective of affiliations, to stand by the people and organise agitations throughout the country to raise their voice against the miseries inflicted on them by a “reckless and insensitive government.”
Irresponsible action
The irresponsible and unprepared actions of the government, on the pretext of curbing black money, has in essence held the lives and livelihood of workers, peasants and the common people — none of whom are from the black money community — to ransom, the press note said.

In reply to oral submissions made by the fishermen at the monthly grievances meeting, Mr. Chavan said the sentiments of the fishermen would be recorded in detail by officials and the report would be forwarded to the government. 
The fishermen who attended the meeting said they were unable to sell their catch. Even if they managed to sell their catch, buyers were not paying them in cash. They were unable to go for fishing due to the funds crunch, they claimed.
When the fishermen complained that they were denied housing facilities under Green House Scheme, Assistant Director of Fisheries Rubert Jothi said the government had allocated 500 Green Houses for the fishermen in village panchayats across the State. 
A survey of houseless fishermen was undertaken by the department and the report was sent to the government. Only those who had individual pattas would be eligible to get the benefit under Green House Scheme, he said.
Mr. Chavan said other fishermen could get housing facility under ‘Housing for All’ Scheme being implemented from the current financial year. The problems expressed by the fishermen on the division of individual pattas would also be taken to the notice of the government, he added.

While Mr. Stalin participated in the protest in Chennai, regional leaders led the protests in the districts and Puducherry Chief Minister and Congress leader V. Narayanasamy joined the human chain in the Union Territory.
Slamming the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, Mr. Stalin said while the DMK was not opposed to the plan to eliminate black money, the sudden and unplanned announcement had caused untold hardships and misery to the small traders, middle and lower middle class citizens, and traders. “This protest is not to condemn the demonetisation by the Centre, but to condemn its implementation (without adequate planning),” he said.
“The Central government keeps saying the people are with them, they are supporting this move…even the Tamil Nadu government might say that. But people are struggling and are queuing up outside banks and ATMs for long. This situation has to be rectified,” the DMK leader said in his constituency, Kolathur.

2016-11-25 00:00:00,Demonetisation: transport sector too skids,"The effects of demonetisation are felt in the public transport system too. The number of persons travelling by buses has dropped, giving a tough time for transport officials, who are now witnessing a fall in revenue.
An official of the Vellore region of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) (Villupuram) Limited said that the revenue has gone down by at least 15 per cent. TNSTC, Vellore, operates 745 buses, including town buses. These buses ply to places including Chennai, Salem, Tiruchi, Villupuram and Bengaluru.
“We are now facing a reduction in collection. Our daily earning, on an average, is around Rs. 70 lakh. There is a decline of about 15 per cent in revenue since demonetisation was announced,” the official said.
Another official said the withdrawal of the two high denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit markets and businesses. “Likewise, it has affected public transport too. People either do not have sufficient money or lack lower denomination currencies. If they give Rs. 2,000 for a Rs. 100 ticket fare, where will our conductors go for change?” he asked.
A crew member of TNSTC also said the number of commuters has come down in the last two weeks.
“Some of them pay using the old Rs. 500 note but conductors do not have change,” he added.
Private buses too face a similar problem. D. Vijaya Govindarajan, president of Vellore District Bus Owners Association, said passenger flow was low, resulting in dull days for private buses. There are nearly 300 buses that ply to various places within the district and neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvannamalai.
“Public movement is low since demonetisation was declared. So, passenger flow has reduced by 20 to 25 per cent. Our revenue has also dropped by 20 to 25 per cent,” he said.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-transport-sector-too-skids/article16724264.ece,VELLORE

While some are developing products that can address issues faced by people to a certain extent, the others are coming up with innovative payment methods and offers to not just retain the customer base but also to increase it.
Incubated in T-Hub is a start-up that has developed a portal that was born to reduce the inconvenience faced by the people standing in long queues outside banks for depositing, withdrawing or exchanging currency. The team of Loan Yatra has developed www.bankQ.in as a philanthropic activity.
“We came up with a solution of booking a slot in all the branches of all the banks in India. This would allow people to book a prior appointment and on that specific day, the user would go to the bank and carry out the required transaction. We made sure that the solution we have created is available to a common man even for those having key pad dialling mobile too with no internet using an IVR system,” said Vijayananda Reddy Kalluru, founder of Loan Yatra.
An engineering innovations company, Express Bike Works promises to wash the dirtiest of the motorcycles under five minutes. 
With a busy centre in Kothaguda in the city, the company has rolled out a tempting offer to bring customers in to the fold of an online payment mode.
 Those who are making payment through Paytm will be charged only Rs. 10 for their first bike wash instead of the regular price of Rs. 200. “Our customers are mostly middle-income group. There was apprehension among them after the government’s decision of demonetisation. Since we wanted them to get used to the online payment mode, we came out with this offer,” said Niraj Taksande, co-founder of Entropy Innovations.

2016-11-25 00:07:00,"Former SBI employee kills self, blames Modi’s demonetisation ","SAONER: A former State Bank of India (SBI) employee allegedly committed suicide at his home in Soaner town of Nagpur district on November 20 and left a suicide note citing “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation” as a reason for his suicide.
“Anant Mukund Bapat, (58), committed suicide at his home in Soaner sometime between 11 am to 4 pm on Sunday (November 20). He was alone at his home when he ended his life. We found a suicide note from his home which mentions the demonetisation of higher currency notes as a reason for the suicide,” Vikaram Kadam, the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) in charge of Soaner police station told The Hindu.
“The undisclosed amount, I had, has become useless because of prime minister Modi’s announcement of demonetisation. I had collected it [undisclosed amount] for Mrunmai’s [his daughter] wedding, but because of Modi’s announcement, it is no more legal. I could not gather the courage to inform my Charted Account about it. Forgive me, my kids, I am going away and making you orphans,” read Mr. Bapat’s suicide note.
Mr. Bapat had taken voluntary retirement from his job as an agriculture officer in the SBI in 2004. He lost his wife in 2014 and is survived by son Parikshit and daughter Mrunmai.
“After quitting his job, he had set up a small business of supply of irrigation material,” informed Mr. Bapat’s friend Mr. Tejsingh Soaji.
The suicide note of Mr. Bapat also said that he had committed mistakes in his life and begged for forgiveness from his children.
“I have committed mistakes and I take its complete responsibility. Please continue Mrunmai’s education and use my insurance and mutual fund amount. Use the gold in bank lockers to pay all the debt,” read the suicide note and asked his children to pay the tax on the undisclosed amount.
The police, however, could not find any high denomination currency from his home.
“We searched his home but we could not find any bigger amount in the form of Rs.500 or Rs.1000 notes. We are also trying to ascertain the authenticity of the suicide note,” informed Mr. Kadam.
But Mr. Bapat’s son Parikshit refused to believe that “demonetisation” was a reason for his father’s suicide.
“I don’t think that [demonetisation] was a reason. We are not in a position to divulge anything. We know the truth and we have told the police everything,” Parikshit Bapat told The Hindu over the phone.
Namdev Saoji, a close friend of Mr. Bapat, said it was tough to believe that he killed himself because of demonetisation.
“He was a jolly man. I never saw him depressed. He was a religious person and would give advice to everyone. He had asked his son to shift with him a month ago and help him in his business,” informed Mr. Saoji, a retail daily goods trader, whose business has come down by “80 percent” due to the demonetisation.
“As an owner of a retail shop a few years ago, he would give bills to his customers on every purchase. It is hard to believe that he had amassed illegal wealth,” stated Mr. Tejsingh Saoji.

2016-11-25 16:58:00,People sitting on huge black money only feel the pain of demonetisation: Shah,"A day after former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh termed the demonetisation move a “monumental management failure”, BJP president Amit Shah hit back with a jibe, saying people sitting on huge black money only feel the pain of it.
“Manmohanji was making a statement in the Rajya Sabha. He felt a lot of pain because of demonetisation decision. Nobody keeps cash of Rs. 10 crore or Rs. 20 crore in the house. So a common man will not lose anything due to demonetisation. But people who stand to lose huge black money can feel the pain,” Mr. Shah said at a party rally here on Friday.
“Till November 7, the whole Opposition was asking Modiji what steps you have taken to tackle black money. Since the evening of November 8, they were asking why you took this step. I want to ask them what you have lost,” he said. “The glow on the face of Opposition parties has faded,” said Mr. Shah.
“The situation is like a high flood in the Mahanadi. There is water everywhere. And one old tree is still not uprooted. To take shelter, a cat, mouse, snake and common mongoose climb on the tree. But, the mouse is not afraid of the cat and the common mongoose does not attack the snake. Everybody is waiting for the water to recede for climbing down the tree,” he said.



“Following the demonetisation flood, the Congress, TMC, Samajwadi Party, AAP and Mayawati have gathered in one platform. They are waiting for the overwhelming support for demonetisation move to diminish,” he said.
“In one strike, Modiji has taken steps to eliminate black money for the welfare of the poor. The people are with the Prime Minister,”he asserted.
“Prime Minister Modi has been working for the development of the country. When he came to power in 2014, the country was stuck in recession and whole world believed that India’s growth story had ended. Now, the world reckons that the 21st century belongs to India. Under the stewardship of Mr. Modi, our country has become the fastest growing economy in the world,” he said.
Taking a potshot at Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Shah said, “He was questioning the steps being taken to defend the country’s boundary. When the UPA was ruling under the leadership of Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, regular attacks were taking place along the border, but enemies were not getting the retaliation. After the Modi government took charge, if bullets were fired from Pakistan’s soil, the same was being responded with mortar. For this, soldiers need not require permission every time they want to strike back.”",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/People-sitting-on-huge-black-money-only-feel-the-pain-of-demonetisation-Shah/article16700887.ece,BHUBANESWAR
2016-11-25 15:11:00,Bengal’s potato growers hit by demonetisation,"Chitra Bag and her family of six are eating less these days. They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesn’t extend credit any longer. Chitra can’t pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes.
“Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so,” Ms. Bag told this reporter. “We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit,” Ms Bag said.
Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer — a middle-aged man — said he could not “extend any more credit” as customers were paying in old bank notes.
Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur.
According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land — second only to Uttar Pradesh — was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the State’s total area. Since Bengal’s industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato.
Ms. Bag — who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May — had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes.
Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes.
He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was “a time-consuming affair” in the potato sowing season.
The potato seeds — which are tubers of the previous year — are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually.
Crisis time
“Since stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes,” Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. “If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds,” warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market.
‘We are helpless’
The officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur – Sethia Cold Storage – accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. “We are instructed not to accept old currency notes,” an official of Sethia Cold Storage said.
Former president of Cold Storage Owners’ Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be “difficult” for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government “should intervene.”
Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants’ federation and Bengal’s Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday.
The problem, however, remains “unresolved”, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants’ Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. “But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected,” he warned.

2016-11-25 00:00:00,Collectors of deposits on the warpath against demonetisation,"Thousands of cooperative bank deposit collectors are on the warpath following the Centre’s decision to demonetise the high- denomination currency notes from November 9.
They say that the declaration that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes were no longer legal tender had almost robbed them of their livelihood. “Our jobs have come to a standstill and our future is uncertain,” Dinesh Perumanna, general secretary, Cooperative Banks Deposit Collectors Association (CBDCA), said.
Nearly 25,000 people are employed in this segment of collecting deposits on a daily or periodical basis from shops, households and institutions. The daily collection is Rs.49 crore to Rs.50 crore in the State. “However, the commission an agent gets is only Rs.10 to Rs.20 for every Rs.1,000 collected. Now, the majority are on the verge of poverty,” he said.
Following the demonetisation, the Centre had restricted even the District Cooperative Banks, which functioned under the Banking Regulation Act, from exchanging the invalid notes.
The situation at the primary cooperative banks and cooperative societies is even worse where they are disallowed to swap the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes collected before the declaration of the demonetisation. “We also want the State government to provide interim relief for collection agents till the financial condition normalises,” Mr. Perumanna said.
The State conference of the CBDCA, which will be held in Kozhikode on November 26 and 27, will chalk out agitation plans against the Centre. Protest would be held in front of the RBI office as well, he said.

2016-11-25 00:00:00,Rs. 10 lakh in demonetised currency seized at airport,"In what is considered to be an indication of the influx of withdrawn Indian currency back to the country in the wake of demonetisation of high-value notes, the Customs Air Intelligence Unit foiled a smuggling attempt and seized Rs.10 lakh in the withdrawn denominations of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 at the Cochin International Airport on Thursday.
Abdul Salam of Panoor in Kannur district was nabbed on his arrival from Dubai on Thursday around 9 a.m.
Addressing a press conference, Customs Commissioner K.N. Raghavan said the undeclared money had become worthless abroad owing to demonetisation.
The arrested person was only a carrier who had reportedly agreed to do the job for a commission of Rs.20,000. He was intercepted by the Air Intelligence officers during baggage checking. The notes were found concealed in a napkin package, tissue paper boxes, and soap powder boxes. There was Rs.7 lakh in Rs.1,000 currency notes and Rs.3 lakh in Rs.500 notes.
Salam had left for Dubai from the Kozhikode airport on November 20.
The verification of his passport revealed that he was a frequent traveller to Dubai. Though he had never been caught before, Customs officials suspect that he had been active in smuggling activities.
The officials also suspect the role of hawala channels behind the currency smuggling. The arrested person allegedly confessed that he had been asked to carry the consignment and hand it over to a person who would contact him outside the airport.

Name revealed

He is learnt to have revealed the name of the person who was supposed to receive the consignment.
Customs officials said even though the government had ordered foreign exchange agencies abroad to stop accepting withdrawn currency, it is learnt that some agencies are still accepting the notes at a 20 per cent reduced exchange rate.
These notes are later sent to India to be exchanged for new notes. “We are interrogating the accused to extract information about other people involved in the activities,” Mr. Raghavan said.
The Customs Department has alerted the Reserve Bank of India, Income Tax Department, and the Enforcement Directorate to the seizure. The department has also registered a case against Salam for carrying money above the permissible limit.
A passenger arriving from abroad should make a declaration at the airport if the amount he possesses exceeds Rs25,000.

The demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes will have an impact on growth in the current quarter but the economy will gradually come back to the ‘new normal’, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
Transactions at wholesale mandis and large projects have been impacted as the government has withdrawn 86 per cent of the currency and it cannot be replaced in one go, she said.
“Government and the RBI are working, but despite all the preparations, there will be an impact this quarter. But I do not think that it will continue further because gradually things will have to come back to some kind of normal but the new normal,” she told PTI.
Under the new normal, she said, there would be more “formal transactions” like more use of cheque books, credit cards or debit cards and e-wallets.
The government on November 8 announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and imposed restrictions on cash withdrawal from banks and ATMs. Since then millions of people across the country have been queueing up at banks and ATMs to exchange old notes and withdraw cash.
Traders and manufacturers have raised concerns over shortage of cash. They are facing problems in paying wages and procuring raw material.
Moody’s Investors Service yesterday said that demonetisation will in the near term significantly disrupt economic activity and lead to weaker growth, but in the long run can boost tax revenues and translate into faster fiscal consolidation.

2016-11-25 00:00:00,Small vendors struggle to tide over crisis post demonetisation,"Worry is writ large on the faces of garment-seller Mohammed Ismail, watch seller F. Anto, and fruit vendor Kumar Durai, all small traders in the city. In the past couple of weeks they have spent the same amount of money, time and energy commuting to their shops and trying to sell their wares as they did last month. But, bundles of items remain unsold in all their shops.
Mr. Durai, a fruit vendor in Flower Bazaar, who used to earn a minimum of Rs. 500 a day pushing his cart through the streets of Flower Bazaar, now hardly makes Rs. 400 in two days. “It is not that I don’t get customers. I turn away at least 30 customers who have only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. I am also worried about the quality of my stock of fruits. If they wither, I stand to lose my capital as well,” he said.
For many fruit, flower and vegetable vendors, the threat of loss of capital is a major issue. M. Mala, a retail vegetable vendor in Koyambedu market, hardly takes home Rs. 150 a day in place of the Rs. 1,500 she got till last month because she doesn’t have any change.
“What I get now is just enough for food and travel. I am unable to repay my loan of Rs. 5,000 from the Mahila bank. The vegetables are rotting and no one is willing to give me credit,’ she said, almost in tears. The inability to do what they had been doing for all these years was an irritant, said Mr. Ismail, who has been selling garments at the same spot in Triplicane for the past 40 years. He said he was worried about how to meet expenses in the coming days.
“I wont be able to pay the rent and electricity bill or buy groceries if I am not able to make a minimum sale every day,” he said.
With their families mostly dependent on their incomes, people are worried about whether they will have enough food.
Mr. Anto, who sells wallets and watches on Anna Salai, said that he was struggling to earn even Rs. 200 a day. A resident of Nandiambakkam, near Minjur, he has two sons, who are looking for jobs. His wife works as a help in a church. “This month will be very difficult for us,” he said. People like C. Veeramani, a cobbler, have not been coming in to work because of the lack of business.
“I've only come today and barely making enough for tea,” he said. Shops that run on small change are suffering too. Shahul Hameed, who sells paan and chocolates in his small shop, complained that business had lessened by nearly half.
“What do we do when people have no change to spare?” he said. The lack of availability of small denomination notes in banks is a problem small traders like Nadeem, a butcher in Neelankarai face. “None of the banks in our area give us change. Most often, hotels send notes of large denomination so that they can get change. If we spend the whole day standing in queues in front of banks, when will we sell the meat?” he asked.
V. Mageshvaran, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Street Vending Workers Federation, said nearly 80 per cent of the street vendors had lost business.

2016-11-25 00:00:00,‘Demonetisation will not achieve stated objectives’,"A panel of economists who met at the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) to discuss the demonetisation policy of the central government said that the stated objectives of the policy will not be fulfilled.
“Essentially, collectively, the panellists have made the following points — that....we are certain that the stated intentions of the government will not be served well,” said Venkatesh B. Athreya, summarising the discussion on behalf of his three co-panellists.
The session, called Understanding Demonetisation: Issues and Challenges, was held at a packed Adiseshiah Auditorium and moderated by C. Lakshmanan of MIDS.
The panellists’ interaction with the audience was disrupted multiple times due to arguments between supporters and critics of the policy.

Demand crash

“What we are saying is that, there is both — pain now, and absolutely no prospect of realising the intentions in the medium or long run,” said Mr. Athreya.
He said that more data was needed before making forecasts about the economy.
“We can definitely say that, in the short term, there will be a demand crash, in the medium term, there will be a production scarcity,” he said, warning that inflationary tendencies would result.
“The declared objectives may not have been the real objectives — that is the speculation,” said Mr. Athreya, who assigned political motives to the Prime Minister’s announcement.

RBI governor’s role

“There used to be an institution called the RBI in this country. Its Governor is the most invisible person today; I wonder if he has joined the black economy,” he said, mentioning he was talking as a political economist.
“All of us have said enough that the moves made by the government lack credibility. We have cast enough doubt on the motives of the government,” said S. Subramanian, formerly with MIDS, who termed the move an unqualified disaster.
“Ultimately, what we are guaranteeing is a redistribution of wealth from actual defaulters to a set of either the same defaulters or a set of potential defaulters,” he said.

Impact on farmers

S. Janakarajan, also with MIDS, said that the policy had affected farmers and its impact would manifest itself in subsequent seasons, leading to food inflation.
He said the informal sector would bear the brunt of the move, citing interactions with ragpickers on the East Coast Road over the past fortnight.
“They are all going to be dead in the 50-55 days the Prime Minister wants to normalise things,” he said

Carpet bombing

Jothi Sivaganam, head of the department of economics at the University of Madras, said that the government was resorting to carpet bombing, instead of a surgical strike to target unaccounted wealth.
“We are squeezing liquidity because of the government’s constraints in supplying currency,” he said.


Economists at a panel discussion said there would be a demand crash and production would be affected

2016-11-25 00:00:00,Narayanasamy leads protest against demonetisation,"The Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Thursday staged demonstrations to condemn the Centre’s decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.
The PCC organised a demonstration in front of the post office on Thursday to protest the Centre’s decision. They shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting public to hardship in the name of fighting corruption.
Addressing the protesters, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said the decision by the Prime Minister to demonetise higher denomination currency notes would not help in curbing black money. Instead, he said, it would only create hardship to the public and destabilise the economy.
People were finding it difficult to meet their daily expenses. Farmers across the country were facing resource crunch to carry out farming.
The value of rupee had come down after demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.
Mr. Narayanasamy questioned the Prime Minister’s rationale of not attending the Parliament when the House had taken up for discussion the demonetisation issue.
“The Congress is not against any decision to fight black money. But the decision of the Union Government had caused difficulty to the common people and will hurt economic growth. The Congress will continue to raise the inconvenience caused to the public,” he said.
The demonetisation issue, he said, would propel the Congress back to power at Centre as the public had realised the folly of electing the BJP to power.
Minister for Public Works and PCC president A. Namassivayam said the common man had been largely affected by the Centre’s decision to demonetise high-value currency. The decision was taken without proper planning, he added.
Minister for Revenue M.O.H.F. Shahjahan, Minister for Social Works M. Kandasamy, Minister for Electricity R. Kamalakannan, PCC functionaries, and DMK leader S.P Sivakumar participated in the demonstration.

Human chain

Later, DMK organised a human chain covering most parts of the town. The party cadre shouted slogans against the Prime Minister and the NDA government.
Chief Minister and PCC chief also joined the DMK cadres in the human chain.

‘Normality soon’

Meanwhile, a senior official with a private bank said the situation had improved drastically and by month end most of ATMs would be recalibrated. Now, the rush was for depositing money and withdrawal of cash unlike in the beginning when people queued up to exchange notes, he added.",Puducherry,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/Narayanasamy-leads-protest-against-demonetisation/article16724089.ece,PUDUCHERRY
2016-11-25 23:32:00,CPI protests ‘unplanned’ demonetisation ," Cadre belonging to the Communist Party of India (CPI) on Friday staged demonstrations at 11 places across Puducherry and its suburbs protesting against the Centre’s decision to demonetise notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. 
Terming the decision as “unplanned”, R. Viswanathan, secretary of the CPI who led the demonstration in front of Corporation Bank at Indira Gandhi square, said the move had severely affected the common man. 
He said the Centre had failed to retrieve black money stashed in foreign countries. Instead of taking action against hoarders, the Centre had put common people in trouble. 
The sudden withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had inconvenienced the people. The common man, especially daily wage workers, small vendors, and retail traders, had been severely affected and are unable to buy medicines and other essential commodities to meet their daily requirements, he said. 
At the agitation held at Thattanchavady, a section of CPI cadre raised slogans against the Union Government and laid a wreath on a non-functional ATM of a nationalised bank.

2016-11-25 19:15:00,Demonetisation brings rural economy to a standstill," Farming and allied agriculture business have come to a standstill in large parts of rural areas in the aftermath of the demonetisation, affecting the normal life of several farmers.
Almost every branch of nationalised bank in rural areas across the district was seen overcrowded at several places. On Friday, many farmers queued up for depositing demonetised currencies and for other transactions at the Indian Overseas Bank branch at Alathur Gate.
 One of the farmers, S. Pazhaniyandi (45) said that though he had been visiting and re-visiting the bank for the past three days to remit Rs. 30,000 towards part re-payment of a jewel loan, he could not do so in the wake of the large number of customers.
Women customers were the worst hit. Revathy, an onion grower, said that she could not exchange the old Rs. 500 currency notes till now. “Being an agricultural labourer, I could not spend much time at the bank,” she said. 
Many Automated Teller Machines remained closed and are yet to be re-filled, forcing the customers to withdraw cash at the bank’s branch.
Non-resident Indians too feel the pinch of demonetisation. M. S. Ali, a non-resident of Peralam village in Nagapattinam district, said that he could not withdraw his money for building a house. “I had come to my native place Peralam in Nagapattinam district for constructing a house. But, I am unable to withdraw cash in bulk,” he said.

2016-11-25 00:00:00,Price of banana falls due to demonetisation,"The demonetisation of high value denomination notes has hit banana growers and traders. Prices of the fruit have fallen sharply as farmers seek to sell their produce quickly.
However, arrival of bananas continue to remain high at the wholesale market at Gandhi Market as the fruit cannot be stocked for long. Occurrence of mist in parts of the district, especially in Musiri, Thottiyam and Namakkal areas, has hastened the harvest as the fruit would ripen quickly.
A. Vijayendran who has been trading in banana for the past four decades, says that ‘poovan’ and ‘rasthali’ are usually the main arrivals during November and December. Arrivals continue to remain high and normally, the market receives about 8,000 bunches a day.
“On Wednesday, I received 500 bunches and on Thursday the arrivals doubled. This has caused a dip in price and a bunch of banana was being sold at about Rs.100 against the normal price of Rs.240 to Rs. 300,” he said.
Farmers also wanted cash in denominations of Rs. 100 and not Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 due to demonetisation, he said. Another dealer, V. Muniappan, said that being a perishable produce, both farmers and wholesale dealers have been seeking to sell their stocks quickly to raise cash ever since the demonetisation.
“Shortage of currency notes of lower denomination has created problems in completing the transactions,” he added.
Traders said that though banana prices tend to dip during the monsoon period, the demonetisation has caused a further fall as farmers are looking to sell the fruits which ripen quickly.",Tiruchirapalli,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/Price-of-banana-falls-due-to-demonetisation/article16724210.ece,TIRUCHI

“In the long term, there will be a new equilibrium in the economy with low interest rate and low tax rate which will lead to efficiency,” Mr. Kant said here at a conference organised by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT).
“Bank deposits will go up and the move will address the structural weaknesses in the banking system. But the biggest achievement would be the end of a parallel economy,” he said.
Mr. Kant urged traders to facilitate cashless transactions through various modes such as debit and credit cards, bank transfers and e-wallets. 
“Around 86 per cent transactions in India are through cash which is the highest globally. This leads to corruption and leakages. Demonetisation will take India towards a cashless economy,” he said.
Aadhaar-enabled payment
Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO, Unique Identification Authority of India called traders to adopt Aadhaar-enabled payment system to go cashless. “Aadhaar number and fingerprint will be sufficient for customers to make transactions. They will not be required to carry their debit or credit cards once their bank details are linked with the Aadhaar number.” ",Business,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Demonetisation-will-bring-economy-to-a-new-equilibrium-says-NITI-Aayog-CEO/article16707566.ece,NEW DELHI 
2016-11-26 22:47:00,Demonetisation: Hotel industry earnings drop by 50 per cent," The daily revenue of hotels and restaurants has dropped by 50 to 60 per cent post demonetisation in Mysuru. 
Hit by currency crunch, the number of people going to restaurants has declined largely and the hotel industry here feels that the situation is unlikely to improve at least till mid-December. 
Continual fall
The hospitality sector’s earning had seen a continual fall since September, barring a short period in October. Tourist footfall had seen a drastic decline in September following the Cauvery agitation. In that month, the revenue had fallen by more than 50 per cent with a fall in tourist arrivals, as protests had taken centre stage in the Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor.
The Cauvery row cast a shadow on the Dasara festivities in October, causing revenue loss to the sector with drop in tourists. Dasara is the time when the hospitality sector hopes to earn good revenue. 
Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association president Narayana Gowda told The Hindu that daily earnings of hotels, restaurants, sweet shops, and bakery sector had fallen from Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 60 lakh since demonetisation.
No dip in costs
 Despite the fall in revenue, the costs involved in running hotels and restaurants has remained the same.
“We have no option but to meet the expenses despite the fall in our income,” Mr. Gowda explained. “How can a restaurant give change for Rs. 2,000 for a bill of Rs. 200,” he asked. Most restaurants have put up boards urging customers to cooperate with them and provide change. 
“We cannot leave a customer because of change problem. How long can we give the reason of change problem since we are here to do business and earn our livelihood. We are doing our best to mobilise change to meet daily needs,” Mr. Gowda said. The association has resolved to pay salaries of workers in the industry in cheque to tide over the cash crisis.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Demonetisation-Hotel-industry-earnings-drop-by-50-per-cent/article16707632.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-26 09:32:00,"Demonetisation a 'draconian’ step, says Greek minister","Greece considered several measures to prevent black money, but never anything as ""draconian"" as the Indian government's demonetisation move, says visiting Greek Alternate (or Deputy) Minister of Foreign Affairs George Katrougalos in an exclusive interview to The Hindu.
Katrougalos, who was formerly Labour minister, also spoke on the Trump effect on global trade, and Greece's support to India for the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Expressing optimism about the future of the Left parties, he said a majority of people believe that neo-liberal policies favour just one percent of the population. The rise of the Right is clear proof that the status quo is not defendable, he said, adding that, when the vacuum is filled by the Right with the rhetoric favouring anti-elite positions, ""we see a Trump win, or the rise of the nationalistic forces in Europe. But the Left also has the chance to fill this vacuum, which is what happened in Greece and Portugal."" (Edited excerpts)
Given that India and Greece have not had very close ties in the recent past, where do you think the broadest bilateral opportunities for cooperation now lie?
We represent ancient civilisations that have always had contact, but it is true that we have a lot to do. On economic issues, we are starting from a relatively low level and this presents an opportunity to improve. India is an economic superpower and we are a country just getting out of a crisis. So there is an opportunity for India to invest in Greece as we have become very affordable in areas such as infrastructure, energy including renewable, information technology and tourism. New direct flights started recently will also help. I have met my counterpart Mr. M.J Akbar and invited him to return the visit, and hope for our foreign minister and Prime Minister to visit in the future.
Multilaterally, India is keen to push its membership for the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which Greece is a member. Did this come up in talks, and where do you see India’s application going?
We are going to support India’s demand, because you have an unblemished record towards non-proliferation of nuclear technology. India’s responsible approach must be recognised, and Greece will be supportive, and we hope the overall climate will be favourable.
Where is the application stuck then? Many countries have offered support, so who is still blocking it?
There were discussions on this on November 11th. It will be discussed in future and I think India will succeed. It is a question of when and not if, but I cannot say that it will happen this year.
You are in India when the burning issue is over the government’s demonetisation exercise. Do you think it was the best way to prevent black money and corruption?
We have similar problems in Greece with regard to black money and the grey economy. Also in the European Union (EU), we have had discussions over what to do with the 500 Euro note. We have taken some measures in Greece, not as draconian as yours (the Indian government’s). For instance, we have said those depositing cash in banks must disclose their identity and other necessary details. However, as someone coming from another country, it is hard for me to have a critical stand without an understanding of the local issues (in India). As I told you, we have not adopted such draconian policies, and I am not fully aware of the situation that you have had to face here, so it would be irresponsible to make comments on the situation. We ourselves are trying to track this (black) money. Those in the grey market and carrying out illegal activities, use this money. In Greece, we have taken many actions to monitor it. We also have a problem in Greece of the “black labour market”, and we are working with international organisations on this as well.
Greece had relied heavily on external debt to improve its economy, but failed in the process. What are the lessons there for India as its external debt to GDP ratio has increased to 23 per cent now from 17 per cent a decade ago? Is India in danger of shocks due to its rising external debt?
The two situations cannot be compared. Well, we did learn a lesson on that (external debt) in our dealings with the EU. It is that we cannot change Greece alone. We have to make the necessary changes in Europe as well. We tried to implement a pro-socialist approach in Greece, and because of the domination of austerity policies in Europe, this has not worked. So now we are trying to influence the long term policies in the EU -- to promote cooperation of leaders who share our viewpoint that for the future of Europe we must work against austerity approach. Also socialist democratic movements and movements to the Left must work closer on our common agendas.
But across the world, it is the right-wing parties that are winning elections -- like in the US. What do you think will be the impact on global trade and investment?
Interestingly, even when we have the rise of the right-wing forces, their discourse is critical of the elite. In the US, on whether they think the government has done enough for the working class, the answer from Republican and Democrat voters saw 67 per cent on each side saying no. So I am optimistic about the future of the Left parties as the majority -- without reference to specific political beliefs like the Trump and anti-Trump voters -- believe that neo-liberal policies favour just one percent of the population. And that’s why the rhetoric of the right-wing favours these anti-elite positions. In Europe it is similar, which explains why trust in national parliaments and the EU are at historic lows between 27-33 per cent.
Are you saying right wing electoral wins across the world actually represent a leftward movement?
No. What I am saying is that they are responding to an objective situation, which is why I am optimistic. The rise of the Right is clear proof that the status quo is not defendable. It can be defeated either by the Left or by the Right. So when the vacuum is filled by the Right then we see a Trump win, or the rise of the nationalistic forces in Europe. But the Left also has the chance to fill this vacuum, which is what happened in Greece and Portugal. In Europe, the parallel to the post World War-I scenario is there, when politicians found Jews as a scapegoat. Now they make immigrants and refugees the scapegoat.
Responding to anti-immigrant sentiments in matters of global trade, India says immigration should not be mixed up with movement of skilled workers overseas for short-term projects. What is Greece’s stand on India’s demand to ensure easy temporary movement of such people for work across the globe?
Greece has the opposite problem, which is that because of this freedom of movement in the EU, we have seen a brain-drain of about 300,000 of our young professionals leaving. Our primary concern is to re-attract younger Greeks to return. On your question, we are for free trade and free movement in general terms.
GMR Group is bidding to develop an international airport in Greece. How do you rate their chances, and how are you pitching for more Indian investment?
By ensuring political stability, we have met the basic requirement of attracting investment. For economic stability, something that every investor wants, we now have a new stable tax system. We also have a new law to remove red tape for investment. We also have tax incentives, and have created special agencies to facilitate investments. Indian investors should choose Greece for all these reasons, and also because we can act as a bridge between Asia and Europe as well as Africa. After the crisis, we lost more than one fourth of our GDP. So at all levels, we are much cheaper than in the past. For country like India that is thinking globally, Greece is a really good place to do business.
India is planning to build over 100 smart cities. Is Greece looking at participating in building smart cities in India?
Greece has developed good IT companies. These cities need not be capital intensive. What is important is that they use human capital smartly. Also, clean energy is an area that has potential for bilateral cooperation.
Given the similarities in manpower capabilities and push for manufacturing, do you think there will be more potential for rivalry between our nations?
No. There are many commonalities, and exchanges of these capabilities are better than rivalry.
Do you think India-Greece ties have taken a back seat because of lack of progress in the proposed India-EU free trade agreement negotiations? Like the UK, do you feel bilateral ties with India is not progressing well due to the EU factor?
No. Being in the EU has helped us improve our relations with other countries. The EU’s remained an economic project, and problems started when political integration was not happening at the same pace as the economic integration. Also, after the recent austerity policies, the new generation began feeling that they might have a worse future than their parents. Therefore, to ensure political legitimacy, the EU must have a greater democratic process where there is more active involvement of its citizens.
Following Brexit, the world was worried about ‘Grexit’ (Greece exiting the EU). Are you saying it won’t happen?
What I am saying is that to the extent that the EU is following austerity policies, it is creating existential problems for its future. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker termed his team as the ‘last-chance Commission.’ But I consider it his ignorance of the dynamics of the EU. By itself, the process of unifying the EU for economic cooperation is noble. But it can be successful only if responds to the actual needs of its citizens. That is what is before the democratic representatives of the European people. We do not like the actual state of the EU, but we decided that the best policy was not to leave the EU, but to try to change it to suit the needs of its people.
For the first time since 2014, the Greece economy recently registered quarterly growth. Do you think Greece will be able to sustain this performance? What are the challenges there given that Greece is depending on financial aid from the IMF?
International organisations forecast a GDP growth of 2.7 in 2017. We need to sustain this growth and ensure that it is inclusive. Almost a third of our citizens are near the poverty threshold. This is the worst in the EU. We have seen improvement though. During our administration, there was a reduction in unemployment. But still a lot of our youth are unemployed even after the brain drain. The question of IMF aid is important. We had a huge debt. But despite the austerity measures and the consequent suffering, the public debt to GDP ratio has ballooned from 128 per cent in 2010 to 180 per cent currently. We have negotiated possible measures to alleviate this debt because it is unsustainable and clearly a burden for the future of Greece. So we hope that now that we have fully respected our obligations in the framework of the (bailout) programmes, it is time for our partners to help in positive measures. In this, we have the IMF’s support. We do not share the views of the IMF in other areas of reforms including labour reforms. We are fully for reforms, but we want workers rights to be respected as well.
In a post-Trump, post-Brexit and post-inward looking government era, clearly the West is changing. Do you think there will be that flexibility towards Greece’s problems and the kind of welfare state that you have advocated?
The answer is never in isolation. We are looking at a Trump era. But it is also a Bernie Sanders era. We had for the first time a change of agenda for the Democratic party in the US. The main failure of Hillary Clinton's candidature was that she focused more on identity issues and not on most of the global issues including poverty and inclusion – in both white and non-white regions. In the EU, we have now debate between pro-austerity and a socialism. Earlier, we did not have this problem of nationalism being promoted by the right-wingers. When we speak about sovereignty, now we are not speaking about popular sovereignty based on the will of the people as we know after the French revolution. We speak about the idea of blood and soil. Fascism and Nazism were born due to the frustration of the middle class, and because the answers were not to face the real problems of the crisis they found a scapegoat in Jews. Now also these are the challenges due to the increase in inequality. It is there in South Africa, which saw a miracle of political emancipation. In Brazil too there is inequality. So everywhere we are facing, as always, a confrontation between the forces of capital and forces of labour. This is clear in the EU as well.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-a-draconian%E2%80%99-step-says-Greek-minister/article16705472.ece,
2016-11-26 00:52:00,Demonetisation is a draconian move: Greek Minister ," Greece and the European Union implemented many measures to counter black money and the “grey economy,” but nothing so “draconian” or drastic as the Indian government’s demonetisation exercise, Greek Minister George Katrougalos has said. 
Mr. Katrougalos, who is on an official visit, said that both the EU and Greece had, like India, discussed the issue of unaccounted wealth as well as the possibility of demonetising the high-value €500 note. “We have taken some measures in Greece, not as draconian as yours [the Indian government’s]. For instance, anybody who goes to bank to deposit cash must give his name and financial records. So, we are trying ourselves to track this money,” the alternate or deputy Foreign Minister told The Hindu in an exclusive interview. 
However, Mr. Katrougalos, who was formerly Labour Minister and is a senior member of the Syriza coalition that rules Greece, clarified that it was difficult to draw comparisons, or to speak about the Indian decision as an outsider. 
“We have not adopted such draconian policies, but I am not fully aware of the situation that you have had to face here.” Greece’s economy crashed following the 2008 global financial crisis, which led to a currency crunch that set off riots across the country. In 2015, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras formed the radical left-wing Syriza government, agreeing to a slew of austerity measures stipulated by the IMF and European creditors (ECB and the European Commission), including tax increases and expenditure cuts. 
Eurozone crisis 
Mr. Katrougalos said the fact that Greece wiped out a quarter of its GDP during the Eurozone crisis meant it presented a “cheap” investment opportunity for Indian companies in infrastructure, energy, renewable energy and Information Technology. “Indian investors should choose Greece, also because we can act as a bridge between Asia and Europe and Africa. At all levels, we are much cheaper than in the past. For a country like India that is thinking globally, Greece is a really good place to do business,” said Mr. Katrougalos, who met Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Minister of State for External Affairs M.J. Akbar.
In a boost to India’s hopes for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), he pledged Greece’s support as a member, but added that the process could take longer than what India had been pushing for. “There were discussions on this on November 11 [at the NSG meeting in Vienna]. It will be discussed in future, and I think India will succeed. It is a question of when and not if, but I cannot say it will happen this year,” Mr. Katrougalos said, adding that India’s “unblemished record” of non-proliferation must be recognised.

2016-11-26 00:42:00,Fracas mars SC hearing on demonetisation ,"A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur said on Friday that the judiciary will “certainly” hear the ground realities and weigh the constitutionality of the November 8 RBI notification scrapping the high-denomination currency notes. 
The court’s assurance came as random accusations of “maximum cash has gone into BJP hands” and “people are starving on the roads” overawed decorum at the hearing, with the Bench urging lawyers to maintain the dignity of the court.
In a much-anticipated hearing on the demonetisation issue, the apex court said it would comprehensively hear arguments on various questions raised in the issue on December 2. These include the hardships caused by demonetisation, the transferring of petitions filed in the various High Courts to Delhi, whether these petitions should be heard by the Delhi High Court or the Supreme Court itself, the constitutional validity of the RBI notification of November 8, and finally, whether the issue should be referred to a Constitution Bench.
In this, the Bench accepted the suggestion of the government that it was better to hear the demonetisation issue in its totality on December 2 rather than in a piecemeal fashion.
Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi submitted that the government's petition to transfer all demonetisation-related cases from other High Courts to the National Capital was already scheduled for hearing on December 2. In that case, the four separate petitions — listed today for hearing on Friday — should also be heard on the same day, Mr Rohatgi said, as this would ensure that the court takes an informed decision after considering all aspects of the issue.
The morning’s hearing began with senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for a petitioner, claiming that “people were starving on the roads.”
“Nobody is starving on the roads,” Mr. Rohatgi said, dismissing the claim peremptorily.
“The markets are closed,” Mr. Sibal shot another barb at the demonetisation exercise to weed out black money.
At this point, advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, who claims that the new Rs. 2000 bank notes bleed easily and can be faked, wrested the floor from Mr. Sibal, claiming “all the banks are closed”.
“Maximum cash has gone into BJP hands,” Mr. Sharma declared as shouts of protest erupted inside the court. Then lawyers vied with each other, raising their hands for the court's attention as pandemonium seemed imminent.
Chief Justice Thakur, on the Bench along with Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, had maintained silence all through. But as the shouting continued, he Chief Justice reined in the confusion by issuing a stern warning that the court would adjourn the hearing by another six weeks unless order was restored immediately.
“Everyone is shouting with their hands over the other's shoulder. This is a courtroom and there is some decorum to be observed here. We will adjourn the case for hearing after the vacation,” Chief Justice Thakur addressed the crowded courtroom.

2016-11-26 00:00:00,Cash-driven ancillary units affected by demonetisation,"The impact of demonetisation on ancillary units in the unorganised sector is likely to have a cascading impact on registered manufacturing units in the long run.
While there are no accurate records of the number of such units in Mysuru — since they are not registered and hence officially “illegal” — they are the backbone of medium and small scale units in the region as they provide services at throwaway rates.
Sources in the industries told The Hindu that the bulk of such ancillary units raised funds through informal sources on a daily or weekly basis at a higher rate of interest. But their source and money supply had evaporated consequent to demonetisation. Though this is reckoned to be a temporary phase, the impact is beginning to be felt and will affect all manufacturing units in Mysuru, according to Suresh Kumar Jain, secretary, Mysore Industries Association.
He said the units which flourished in the unorganised sector include printing, welding, lathe workshops, carpentry, electrical wiring, automobile repair shops, and food processing units where transaction is by cash and workers are paid daily.
“With cash crunch extending for almost two weeks, daily wage workers are unable to sustain themselves. In addition, there is a withdrawal limit of Rs. 24,000 a week, which is inadequate for the entrepreneur,” Mr. Jain said. In the absence of registration, institutional finance by way of bank loans are not extended to such units and thus, the impact of demonetisation is greater on them.
According to Sudhakar Shetty, vice-president, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, there are not less than 12,000 MSME units in the unorganised sector in Mysuru district, employing nearly a lakh people at a conservative estimate.
“Daily wagers are not paid in cheques and most have no accounts for money transfer. This transition period is very painful,” Mr. Shetty said.
As many entrepreneurs in the micro units do not operate through banks, they do not have overdraft facility or cannot avail themselves of advances available for registered industries. Meanwhile, the MIA is trying to extend assistance to enable them to open bank accounts to bring them to mainstream.
Medium and large scale units where payment is through cheques and electronic form have not been affected.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Cash-driven-ancillary-units-affected-by-demonetisation/article16724665.ece,MYSURU
2016-11-26 00:14:00,Demonetisation impacts gold loan schemes in Mandya district," The demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes announced by the Centre on November 8 has left a tell-tale impact on the gold monetisation schemes (GMS) across the district.
The demonetisation has paralysed the flourishing gold-loan business of pawn brokers completely, apart from forcing customers to stay away from banks following the weekly ceiling of Rs. 24,000 on cash withdrawals.
“The number of customers and general public approaching banks seeking ‘loans for gold’ has fallen drastically owing to demonetisation, N.G. Prabhudev, manager, Lead Bank of Mandya (Vijaya Bank), told The Hindu here on Friday.
The Kallahalli branch of Canara Bank, off the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway here, used to issue gold-loans to at least four people everyday. Nevertheless, only four have availed the facility since the announcement of ban on the circulation of two high-value notes, a senior officer at the bank said.
Across Mandya
According to officials at various major nationalised banks, the situation is not different at banks or branches at other places in all seven taluks.
The district has 284 branches of 28 nationalised and private banks. On an average, the branches used to lend money to at least 2,200 persons everyday under the gold monetisation schemes (GMS). However, the number of beneficiaries under the GMS is less than 900 since the announcement of the demonetisation move.
Weekly restrictions
The cash withdrawal limit per person a week has been fixed at Rs. 24,000. The gold loan amount will be transferred to the individual’s bank account. Customers with savings bank (SB) accounts can withdraw Rs. 24,000 a week, while those who have current accounts (CA) are eligible to withdraw Rs. 50,000 a week. 
The response to GMS has significantly come down because of the restrictions on cash withdrawal, Mr. Prabhudev said.
Pawn brokers
Meanwhile, the business of pawn-brokers has come to a halt after the demonetisation, said sources from the Pawn Brokers Association.
The district has over 700 pawn brokers and all of them have stopped lending gold-loans because of the non-availability of valid currency notes, Heeralal, a pawnbroker, said.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Demonetisation-impacts-gold-loan-schemes-in-Mandya-district/article16702671.ece,Mandya
2016-11-26 00:00:00,Milk producers in HK region feel demonetisation heat,"With district central cooperative banks running short of valid currency caused by demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, coupled with the government-imposed limit on the amount of transactions in banks, over 41,000 small milk producers across the rural areas of Hyderabad Karnataka region are forced to manage their households without payment for the last two weeks.
Though the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Ltd (KMF) is making payments to societies online as usual, the milk societies that procure milk at village level are unable to make weekly payments to milk suppliers.
Kalaburagi Milk Union, under which Bidar, Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts fall, procures around 57,000 litres of milk a day from around 10,700 farmers and makes payments to milk suppliers on weekly basis. However, it could not make payments — about Rs. 1 crore a week — farmers for the last two weeks.
“As per the Union government, a person or cooperative society can draw maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week. It is insufficient to make payments to all milk suppliers. The milk societies have therefore stopped payments to farmers for the last two weeks. I have been receiving a number of calls on the payment-related grievances and rushing to those places for redressing them,” Manohar Kulkarni, deputy manager, Kalaburagi Milk Union, told The Hindu on Friday.
DCC bank officials were saying that the issue of currency shortage would hopefully be resolved by Monday, he said.
Some milk societies that had adopted online mode of payment to their suppliers well before the demonetisation are at ease. But their number is too small. As per the information provided by KMF officials, of 355 functional milk cooperative societies under Kalaburagi Milk Union, only 15 have adopted online mode of payment.
Upon the pressure from the Ballari Milk Union, which procures over 2 lakh litres of milk a day from around 30,500 milk farmers spread across 605 unions in Ballari, Koppal and Raichur district, Ballari DCC Bank has taken up an account opening drive among milk producers so as that it can disburse the payments online.
“If all the milk producers have their back accounts in rural district cooperative bank, their payment can be made through online transfer. But, they have bank accounts in various nationalised banks and DCC banks don’t have facility of Real Time Gross Settlement. Upon our request, they have now started bank account opening drive among milk farmers so that they could make online payments within next two months,” Marulu Siddappa, Assistant Manager at Ballari Milk Union told The Hindu .
In some societies, milk farmers without bank account are advised to open accounts so that their dues and future payments can be made online. ""Opening a bank account is a tiresome job for them as bank staff are busy with exchanging demonetised notes working overtime,"" said an officer.
DCC banks plead helplessness in the matter. “Even if we have enough currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 100 or lesser denomination, we cannot allow milk cooperative societies to draw more than Rs. 24,000 a week as per the government directions,” Sidramareddy Patil, chairman of Kalaburagi DCC Bank, told The Hindu .
If there were no restrictions, he added, there would be a good recovery of loans in the banks.
KMF officials criticise the Union government for not exempting cooperative societies from restrictions of money transactions at banks. “At least now, the government should either exempt the cooperative societies from transaction restrictions or allow them to draw such amount of money that they require for clearing dues to milk suppliers every week,” Nagappa, an officer working with KMF in Bidar said.

Chavan said here on Friday.
In reply to oral submissions made by the fishermen at the monthly grievances meeting, Mr. Chavan said the sentiments of the fishermen would be recorded in detail by officials and the report would be forwarded to the government.
The fishermen who attended the meeting said they were unable to sell their catch.
Even if they managed to sell their catch, buyers were not paying them in cash. They were unable to go for fishing due to the funds crunch, they claimed.
When the fishermen complained that they were denied housing facilities under Green House Scheme, Assistant Director of Fisheries Rubert Jothi said the government had allocated 500 Green Houses for the fishermen in village panchayats across the State.
A survey of houseless fishermen was undertaken by the department and the report was sent to the government. Only those who had individual pattas would be eligible to get the benefit under Green House Scheme, he said.
Mr. Chavan said other fishermen could get housing facility under ‘Housing for All’ Scheme being implemented from the current financial year. The problems expressed by the fishermen on the division of individual pattas would also be taken to the notice of the government, he added.

Biometric IDs

The fishermen, headed by Kanniyakumari District Meen Thozhilalar Sangam secretary Antony, demanded that the biometric identity cards issued by the government should be routed through their association, and not through the officials.

Almost every branch of nationalised bank in rural areas across the district was seen overcrowded.
On Friday, many farmers queued up for depositing demonetised currencies and for other transactions at the Indian Overseas Bank branch at Alathur Gate.
One of the farmers, S. Pazhaniyandi (45) said that though he had been visiting and re-visiting the bank for the past three days to remit Rs. 30,000 towards part re-payment of a jewel loan, he could not do so in the wake of the large number of customers.
Women customers were the worst hit. Revathy, an onion grower, said that she could not exchange the old Rs. 500 currency notes till now.
“Being an agricultural labourer, I could not spend much time at the bank,” she said.
Many Automated Teller Machines remained closed and are yet to be re-filled, forcing the customers to withdraw cash at the bank’s branch.
Non-resident Indians too feel the pinch of demonetisation. M. S. Ali, a non-resident of Peralam village in Nagapattinam district, said that he could not withdraw his money for building a house.

Two women died while standing in queues outside banks in Ballia and Muzaffarnagar, while a rickshaw-puller hanged himself to death after he learnt of the Centre’s decision to end over-the-counter exchange of now-defunct Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new ones at bank branches.
The police said Indrasani Devi (70), who was standing for over three hours in a queue outside a Central Bank branch in Ratsad area of Ballia, suddenly fell ill.
She died of cardiac arrest soon after.
As the family did not have any cash for cremation of the body, the daughter-in-law of the deceased had to stand in queue at the same bank to withdraw money for it, they said.
SP (Superintendent of Police) Vaibhav Krishna said the matter will be probed and necessary action will be taken against those found responsible.
In Muzaffarnagar in western Uttar Pradesh, 85-year-old Murti Devi died while standing in a queue outside a PNB branch in Hanuman Chowk. The police said she had come to withdraw money from the bank.
Meanwhile, a rickshaw-puller, Akbar (27), committed suicide by hanging himself at his house in Khurja, about 20km from Bulandshahr, after he learnt that the government has barred people without bank accounts from exchanging now-defunct Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new ones at bank branches.
The government had on Thursday stopped over-the-counter exchange of defunct currency notes.

Mr. Mitra said while the circulation of counterfeit currency notes in the economy was estimated to be about Rs.400 crore in 2014 “according to government’s own intelligence unit,” the demonetisation exercise will cost Rs.14.5 lakh crore to the economy.

2016-11-26 14:59:00,"Demonetisation has eroded people’s confidence in currency, banking system: Kharge "," Former Union Minister and Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge has charged the ruling BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of eroding confidence of the people in the currency and banking activities through its flip flop actions after demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes.
Speaking to media representatives in Kalaburagi on Saturday, Mr. Kharge said that Union government’s changing stance on the demonetisation and the exchange of the demonetised notes in banks and restrictions on the withdrawal of taxed cash from individual accounts had eroded the confidence of the people in the currency.
Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated statement of cashless transaction and use of mobile for all transactions, Mr. Kharge pointed out that the currency continued to rule the roost and the online transaction was limited to certain sector even in the developed countries like USA and the European Union countries.
Mr. Kharge said in India majority of the transaction is done through cash, more particularly so in the rural areas and small cities and towns and only a small population living the metros and big cities use the cashless transaction facility.
On the controversial statement of Prime Minister that those opposed to demonetisation were supporting the black money, Mr Kharge said that Mr. Modi was not speaking like a statesman. 
“Even Supreme Court has made severe strictures and critical observations about the way the demonetisation was handled by the Union government. Does this mean that even the apex court is also anti-national and supporting black money? Misrepresenting the facts and spreading falsehood and branding all those who oppose his decision of demonetisation as the supporters of black money holders is wrong? Mr. Kharge said.
Mr. Kharge said that Prime Minister should not consider himself as paragon of virtues and owes an explanation to the people on how those close to him acquired properties worth several crores overnight days before the demonetisation.
“The PM should also explain how crores of rupees were deposited in the accounts of the BJP in Kolkota prior to the demonetisation. He should tell the nation who leaked the information about demonetisation to them.”
Mr. Kharge wondered why Mr. Modi was shying away from the Parliament and speaking everything outside the parliament when the house was in session. “Mr. Modi is obviously afraid to face the parliament and has no valid explanation to the points raised by the opposition parties.”
To a question, Mr. Kharge said that no Bharat Bandh has been called on November 28 against the demonetisation issue by the opposition parties and the day would be observed as Äkrosh Divas with the opposition parties holding different forms of protests throughout the country in all the district headquarters, state capitals and at New Delhi.

Raising the issue at the Farmers Grievances meeting here, N. Ganesan, joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Welfare Association, said although the Tiruchi District Cooperative Milk Producers Union (Aavin) released the payments through banks, the cooperative milk producers societies in rural areas were unable to withdraw the money from the banks and disburse cash to producers as was the usual practice till now.
“We used to withdraw cash from the society accounts and make the payments due to producers once every 15 days. Now, banks say that we can withdraw only Rs.12,000 a week,” Mr. Ganesan said. The District Central Cooperative Bank was unable to make direct transfers to the accounts of producers, he claimed.
“The income from milk is vital for most farmers and the delay in payment has caused much hardship,” Mr. Ganesan said and urged the district administration to take steps to ensure that the payments were transferred to the accounts of the producers directly.
Collector K. S. Palanisamy, who chaired the meet, instructed the Aavin officials to hold field-level meetings with the milk producers to find out their preferred mode of payment.
If the sum was high, payments could be made by bank transfers to individual bank accounts of producers.

Thirunavukkarasar has alleged that the Centre’s demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has severely affected them.
“Commercial units or industrialists do not seem to have been affected much by the announcement made by Prime Minister Modi. In a country where only about one per cent of the total population pays the income tax, about 90 per cent of the transactions are through cash,” he said in a statement.
Against this background, announcing demonetisation and thereby curtailing circulation of 86 per cent of the cash of the poor and the middle-class had led to a pathetic situation with crores of people being forced to stand in long queues before banks and ATMs for exchanging their old notes, he said.
“It doesn’t look like the BJP understands that 60 crore people in the country do not have bank accounts at all.”
Referring to the proposed agitation called for by opposition parties against demonetisation on November 28, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar urged his party cadre to turn up in large numbers to protest against the “anti-people” policies of the BJP government.

2016-11-26 14:48:00,No demand for rollback of demonetisation: Yechury," Though the left parties are a part of the seemingly united opposition to the demonetisation undertaken by the Centre, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will not support the demand to roll-back the initiative. 
Talking to reporters during an interaction on Saturday, Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of CPI(M) said a roll back of the announcements and slew of restrictions will stop even the possibility of eliminating the 2 or 3 per cent of stacked ‘black’ money. “Our concern is the people, whose economic activities and livelihood have been stalled due to the announcements. We want old notes to be exchanged and used in a wider variety of activities,” he said.
On November 28, numerous opposition parties including the left parties, Trinamool National Congress, Indian National Congress have called for an “Akrosh Divas” (a day of anger) to express the inability of the Centre to restore economic activity after nearly 85 per cent of the country’s cash was scrapped. When asked if this would further inconvenience the public, Mr. Yechury said: “This is a call for protest action, not a bandh. The opposition will march separately, but strike together. Our point is to redress the anger of the people. It is demonetisation that has seen a bandh-like situation as economic activities have come to a standstill.”
The protest action was also to pressure Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address parliamentarians. “If he continues to remain silent (after November 28), the opposition parties will have to think seriously,” he said. 
With distress spreading across the economic landscape, particularly in rural areas, the CPI(M) leader said the constant flip-flops, exemptions and barrage of notifications compounded the absurdity of demonetisation. “Farmers are selling crops in distress. The government believes that allowing old notes to buy seeds is a solution. But anyone familiar with agriculture, knows that farmers do not buy just from government outlet. They buy even from fellow farmers in a form of barter or cash transactions,” he said.
The demonetisation initiative has failed in all its four objectives (eradicating black money, reducing corruption, terror financing and putting an end to counterfeiting) and this failure would reflect in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, said Mr. Yechury.",Bengaluru,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/No-demand-for-rollback-of-demonetisation-Yechury/article16706118.ece,Bengaluru

Stating that some kind of incentive for taxpayers needs to be introduced, Dr. Charan Singh, professor, IIMB, said, “For those who do not pay taxes, exemplary punishment must be given.” 
Panellist V. Sridhar, Senior Deputy Editor, Frontline, said black money, which is laundered through multiple accounts, goes abroad and returns to India under the guise of foreign investment, and that is the greater danger.
The panellists also underscored the importance of introducing more transparency into the system. “E-passbooks will be introduced in banking transactions shortly, where all properties will be attached, thereby bringing in more transparency,” said Chenraj Roychand, president, Jain University Trust. Though business may have been hit in the short term, the long-term benefits of the move were immense, he said.

2016-11-27 00:00:00,Yechury: Won’t support demand for rolling back demonetisation,"Though the Left parties are part of the united Opposition to the demonetisation drive undertaken by the Centre, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will not support the demand for a rollback of the initiative.
Speaking to reporters during an interaction here on Saturday, Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of CPI(M), said a rollback and a slew of restrictions will stop even the possibility of eliminating the 2 or 3 per cent of stacked ‘black’ money. “Our concern is the people, whose economic activities and livelihood have been stalled due to the announcements. We want old notes to be exchanged and used in a wider variety of activities,” he said.

‘Protest, not bandh’

When asked if the protests planned on Monday against demonetisation would further inconvenience the public, Mr. Yechury said: “This is a call for protest action, not a bandh. The Opposition will march separately, but strike together. Our point is to redress the anger of the people. It’s demonetisation that has seen a bandh-like situation, as economic activities have come to a standstill.”

‘Pressure on PM’

The protest action is also to put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address parliamentarians.
“If he continues to remain silent (after November 28), the Opposition parties will have to think seriously,” he added.
Speaking further on the Prime Minister’s silence in Parliament, Mr. Yechury said: “The tables had turned. (Former Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh’s speech in Parliament was articulate and powerful. Modi sat silently for an hour and left after the break. It is now, Narendra Maun Modi (a reference to the taunt ‘Maunmohan’ Singh during the tenure of the UPA government),” he said.

2016-11-27 01:33:00,Temples busy counting demonetisation bounty,"VIJAYAWADA: The government move to withdraw currency of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations has been impacting collections at temples as devotees are dumping the scrapped notes in hundis.
A couple of days ago, the Machavaram Anjaneya Swamy temple officials were taken by surprise when they opened the hundi (collection box). They found the demonetised Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes' bundles along with a few notes of lesser denominations. They found 50 to 60 bundles of Rs 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination currency.
Temple executive officer N. V. Sambasiva Rao said that the temple usually receives about Rs. 3 lakh as hundi offerings from devotees in about two months. This was the first time the temple hundi collection crossed Rs. 1 crore, which was a quantum leap. Generally, there would be a jump in the offerings during festivals but definitely not at this magnitude, he observed.
Another temple, Jaladeeswara shrine at Ghantasala, received Rs. 50 lakh a week ago. A major portion of this offering was Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 currency notes.
Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam, one of the major temples in the State, is also not lagging behind. The temple has been receiving lakhs of rupees in specified notes. The temple received Rs. 22.58 lakh in Rs. 1000 denomination by November 11 and another Rs. 56.25 lakh in Rs. 500 notes. In a subsequent collection on November 17, devotees deposited Rs. 6.83 lakh worth of Rs. 1000 currency notes and Rs. 22.34 lakh worth of Rs.500 currency notes. The trend continued on November 24 counting also. The temple received Rs. 601 notes of Rs.1000 and 2,681 notes of Rs. 500. Another Rs. 3.79 lakh worth Rs. 1000 and Rs.500 notes were deposited on November 25.
The hundis fill up fast during festivals and auspicious occasions. The denominations of Rs 100, Rs 50, Rs 20 and Rs 10 and coins in the hundi are less compared to higher denomination currency. “It is definitely the fallout of the Central government's announcement of the demonetisation of high-value currency,” a staffer remarked.",Vijayawada,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/Temples-busy-counting-demonetisation-bounty/article16708783.ece,

2016-11-27 20:57:00,‘Only black money holders are opposing demonetisation’ ,"RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM: Stating that only black money holders were opposing demonetisation, Union Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said that the Centre’s exercise would benefit the poor and the common man in the long run and harm only those who possess unaccounted for money and disproportionate assets. 
Addressing the media here, Mr. Naidu said that teething troubles were common in any initiative, and demonetisation was no exception. 
“But still, people are welcoming it and congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Except black money holders, everyone is happy with demonetisation,” he said, adding that cancellation of high denomination notes did not affect the poor and the common man. It was shortage of small change that was pestering them at many places. 
“The issue will be addressed very soon. It is like a rebirth of our economy and we have to share the pangs initially,” he said. 
Lambasting the opposition parties for politicising the issue by calling for bandh, Mr. Naidu wondered why a bandh should be observed when most of the people were happy with Mr. Modi’s decision. 
“People won’t participate in the bandh as they are welcoming demonetisation and putting up with the initial inconvenience,” he said.

2016-11-27 01:36:00,Parties opposing demonetisation only to defame Modi: Bandaru ,"TIRUPATI: Union Minister for Labour Bandaru Dattatreya has flayed the opposition parties for blindly opposing demonetisation only with the intention of defaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Addressing a media conference here on Saturday, Mr. Dattatreya called it a thoroughly planned exercise and not a ‘hasty decision’ as was being projected by a section of the political spectrum. “Only the Congress, Left and ‘some’ regional parties are opposing the decision for their own political ends, but 85 per cent of people have welcomed the move,” he said pointing to a survey.
On migration to a cashless society, he expressed pain that educated politicians too preferred to play to the gallery by criticising the government, without appreciating the well-intended move. “Rahul Gandhi is an educated young leader. Though he knows the benefits of a cashless society, he is playing politics. Former Prime Minister and economist Manmohan Singh too resorts to shallow criticism instead of giving constructive suggestions to the government,” he said. “From Nehru to the recent PM, everybody had the vision and noble thought to eradicate corruption, but only Mr. Modi exhibited the will to act tough.” 
To a query on bringing the ill-gotten money stashed in banks abroad, Mr. Dattatreya observed that it required a three-pronged strategy, viz., ensuring tie-up with other countries, formulating a legal framework and forming a coordination body to oversee the operation. “Starting with Mauritius, we are in the process of making pacts.”
As the Labour Minister, he announced that Jan Dhan accounts would be opened for the construction workers, domestic helps and workers employed in Anganwadi, ASHA and midday meal programmes to bring them into the ambit of banking. District level camps would be conducted to open accounts on a war-footing. Following the high-level understanding between the Ministries of Finance and Labour, the labour officials and the State-level bankers committee would sit together in the presence of the respective district Collectors and formulate ways to opening the accounts. This step is aimed at eliminating middlemen, delivering the benefits directly to the beneficiaries and also encouraging cashless transactions, he said. “Elimination of middlemen means eliminating black money.” 
BJP legislator and floor leader in Telangana Assembly Chintala Ramachandra Reddy was also present.
Special Correspondent in Tirumala writes: Mr. Dattatreya termed the demonetisation move as a very courageous decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Appreciating the measures being taken up by the temple administration in minimising the difficulties of the pilgrims post demonetisation, he said it was a matter of pride that the town had topped the list of 10 iconic places in the country and that the government also had released Rs.100 crores for taking up further developmental activities. 
Earlier Mr. Dattatreya accompanied by his newly married daughter and other family members had offered prayers to the presiding deity. ",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Parties-opposing-demonetisation-only-to-defame-Modi-Bandaru/article16708791.ece,
2016-11-27 00:48:00,Bengal’s potato growers hit by demonetisation," Chitra Bag and her family of six are eating less these days. They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesn’t extend credit any longer. Chitra can’t pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes.
“Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so,” Ms. Bag told this reporter. “We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit,” Ms Bag said. 
Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer — a middle-aged man — said he could not “extend any more credit” as customers were paying in old bank notes.
Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur. 
According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land — second only to Uttar Pradesh — was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the State’s total area. Since Bengal’s industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato. 
Ms. Bag — who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May — had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes.
Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes. 
He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was “a time-consuming affair” in the potato sowing season.
The potato seeds — which are tubers of the previous year — are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually.
Crisis time
“Since stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes,” Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. “If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds,” warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market.
‘We are helpless’
The officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur – Sethia Cold Storage – accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. “We are instructed not to accept old currency notes,” an official of Sethia Cold Storage said.
Former president of Cold Storage Owners’ Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be “difficult” for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government “should intervene.”
Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants’ federation and Bengal’s Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday. 
The problem, however, remains “unresolved”, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants’ Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. “But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected,” he warned.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Bengal%E2%80%99s-potato-growers-hit-by-demonetisation/article16708497.ece,Jamalpur (Bardhaman)

2016-11-27 00:00:00,Demonetisation hampers tobacco cultivation in Prakasam district,"Farmers in Prakasam district are at their wits end as severe cash crunch in the wake of demonetisation has hampered transplantation of tobacco, the main commercial crop in the drought-prone district during rabi.
Farmers, who have been used to growing more than the crop size in the past despite the crop regulator imposing hefty penalties, are likely to produce at least 25 million kg less than the crop size 39.9 million kg in southern light soil (SLS) and 41.9 million kg in southern black soil (SBS) this fiscal.
Farmers with two tobacco barns need at least Rs. 1.50 lakh to complete transplantation of seedlings procured, especially from Rajamahendravaram, says V. Varaprasad, Farmers’ Association president in Ongole II auction platform.
“But bank officials are dispensing with only Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 10,000 in cash after we made repeated visits to banks since November 8,” complains a farmer Vadela Narayana Rao, who has begun transplantation in his 20-acre plot in Mangamoor village much against odds. “In view of the drought condition, water is being arranged by tankers at the rate of Rs. 500 per trip. I need to make a cash payment of Rs. 10,000 for water transportation alone,” explains the farmer, who finds it difficult to get loan even from private financiers. “How can we take up transplantation with meagre cash flow?” asks a group of angry farmers in Chekurpadu, near Nagulapupadu. So is the case with a majority of SLS and SBS farmers who are frantically hoping for return of liquidity. All payments are made only by way of cash to farm workers right from raising seedlings to curing of tobacco leaves in barns, explains S.Gurava Reddy, Farmers’ Association president in Ongole I auction platform.
Demonetisation has come at a more inopportune time for the growers as it is during November that tobacco cultivation picks up pace in the traditional tobacco growing areas, former Tobacco Board member Ch. Ranga Rao says. He rules out cashless payments in the sector.
Though the crop loan has been sanctioned, the amount had not been released with bank officials who are busy with demonetisation exercise like exchanging of scrapped notes, complains M. Anjaneyulu, a farmer from Maddipadu.
Not to take any risk, Sanagala Venkateswarulu, a farmer from Podili, says he has kept away from tobacco cultivation this year.
The crop coverage is only 2,700 hectares as against the authorised cropping area of 26,209 hectares in SLS, needing gap filling in large extent of land, says SLS Regional Manager G. Ratnasagar.
It is somewhat better in the SBS region where the plantations have been taken up in 3,111.70 hectares as against 21,575.22 hectares permitted by the Tobacco Board, says SBS Regional Manager G.Umamaheswara Rao. “If the present situation continues tobacco production may drastically fall by 30 per cent from the authorised crop size of 81.8 million kg,” according to the Indian Tobacco Association (ITA) sources.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-hampers-tobacco-cultivation-in-Prakasam-district/article16725559.ece,ONGOLE

Channe Gowda, a resident of Salagame village in Hassan taluk, sells vegetables at the weekly market every Sunday. In the past three days, he has been seeing poor turnout at the market, which has had a direct impact on his earnings. “People do not have cash in hand. As Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes are no longer accepted, people have become cautious while spending,” he said. “I am told that in the future we have to carry card-swipe machines.

Similar is the response from Ismail, who sells farm tools. “I have watched experts speaking about cashless transactions. That may come into effect if people stop carrying cash. However, farmers, who are our customers, prefer cash. Many have never even used debit cards though they had got them after opening their bank accounts,” he said.
He said he used to have business of Rs. 3,000 a day, but this Sunday he hardly earned Rs. 1,000.
It is a similar story for the vegetable sellers. In fact, many of them brought fewer vegetables to the market this time. “I hardly earn Rs. 1,500 a day.

Mallikarjun Kharge has charged the National Democratic Alliance government with eroding confidence of the people in the Indian currency and banking activities through its flip flop after the demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000.
Speaking to presspersons on Saturday, he said that the Union government’s changing stance on the exchange of demonetised notes in banks and the restrictions on withdrawal of taxed cash from individual accounts had eroded the confidence of the people in the currency.
Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated statements to go for cashless transactions and use mobile phones for transactions, Mr. Kharge pointed out that currency continued to rule the roost in most parts of the country and online transactions were limited to certain sectors even in developed countries.
“In India, most of the transaction are through cash, more particularly so in rural areas, small cities and towns and only a minuscule population living in metros and big cities use cashless transaction through mobile phones and plastic cards.”
On the Prime Minister’s statement that those who oppose demonetisation were supporting black money, Mr. Kharge said that Mr. Modi was not speaking like a statesman and his statement did not behove well with the position he occupies. 
“Even the Supreme Court has made severe strictures and critical observations about the way demonetisation was handled by the Union government. Does this mean that even the apex court is also anti-national and supporting black money? Misrepresenting facts and spreading falsehood and branding all those who oppose his decision of demonetisation as the supporters of black money holders is wrong,” Mr. Kharge said. 
He said that the Prime Minister should not consider himself as paragon of virtues and he owed an explanation to the people how people close to him acquired properties worth several crores overnight a couple of days prior to demonetisation. “Mr. Modi should also explain how crores of rupees were deposited in the accounts of the BJP in Kolkota prior to demonetisation. He should tell to the nation who leaked the information about demonetisation to them.”
Mr. Kharge wondered why Mr. Modi was shying away from Parliament and speaking everything outside when the House was in session. “Mr. Modi is obviously afraid to face Parliament and has no valid explanation to the points raised by the Opposition parties.” To a question, Mr. Kharge said that ‘Bharat Bandh’ had not been called on November 28 by the Opposition and the day would be observed as Akrosh Divas.

2016-11-27 00:00:00,Demonetisation: Hotel industry earnings drop by 50 per cent,"The daily revenue of hotels and restaurants has dropped by 50 to 60 per cent post demonetisation in Mysuru.
Hit by currency crunch, the number of people going to restaurants has declined largely and the hotel industry here feels that the situation is unlikely to improve at least till mid-December.

Continual fall

The hospitality sector’s earning had seen a continual fall since September, barring a short period in October. Tourist footfall had seen a drastic decline in September following the Cauvery agitation. In that month, the revenue had fallen by more than 50 per cent with a fall in tourist arrivals, as protests had taken centre stage in the Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor.
The Cauvery row cast a shadow on the Dasara festivities in October, causing revenue loss to the sector with drop in tourists. Dasara is the time when the hospitality sector hopes to earn good revenue.
Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association president Narayana Gowda told The Hindu that daily earnings of hotels, restaurants, sweet shops, and bakery sector had fallen from Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 60 lakh since demonetisation.

No dip in costs

Despite the fall in revenue, the costs involved in running hotels and restaurants has remained the same.
“We have no option but to meet the expenses despite the fall in our income,” Mr. Gowda explained. “How can a restaurant give change for Rs. 2,000 for a bill of Rs. 200,” he asked. Most restaurants have put up boards urging customers to cooperate with them and provide change.
“We cannot leave a customer because of change problem. How long can we give the reason of change problem since we are here to do business and earn our livelihood. We are doing our best to mobilise change to meet daily needs,” Mr. Gowda said.

2016-11-27 21:21:00,"Demonetisation: Railway, transport unions demand salary in cash","Madurai: Post-demonetisation, some of the trade bodies, including railway employees’ unions and Tamil Nadu State Transport employees’ union, have demanded that the salary payable in December be paid in cash to their members and not through regular electronic clearance.
The Centre has put a cap on daily withdrawal from the ATMs at Rs. 2,500. “If lakhs of railway men stand in the queue on December 1 for withdrawing money at the ATMs and banks, it will only add to the existing problem,” said Southern Railway Mazdoor Union general secretary N. Kannaiah.
He said only the salaried class would be affected as their salary was deposited in banks. Traders carried out money transactions every day and had easy access to currencies of smaller values.
“How does the government expect ‘running’ staff like me (a railway guard) to stand in queue for a whole day to withdraw money,” asked divisional secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union R. Sankaranarayanan.
However, he was quick to add that the very demand for disbursement of entire salary in cash was only to put some pressure on the government.
The union leaders said the payment of salary advance of Rs. 10,000 made on Thursday was only because of their demand.
“Stop payment to banks”
M. Nandasingh, national council member of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), said his organisation had urged the heads of all 21 transport corporations in the State to stop remittance of daily collections in banks.
“The money of smaller denominations could be used to make salary payment to transport corporation employees,” he said.
Stating that disbursement of salary through electronic clearance has been done only for the last eight years, he said the standing order of transport corporation was payment of salary in cash.
Not possible
However, a bank official said it was highly impossible to provide cash for entire salary of the Central Government and State Government employees in view of the cash crunch faced by the banks.
“The ceiling on withdrawal of Rs. 24,000 a week stands good for all for the simple reason that we do not have cash. Besides, salary disbursement through cash will defeat the very idea of the Union Government to encourage transactions through banks,” he said.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Demonetisation-Railway-transport-unions-demand-salary-in-cash/article16711479.ece,
2016-11-27 00:00:00,TNCC flays Modi for demonetisation,"In introducing the new Rs. 2,000 currency, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has only facilitated those who harboured black money, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S. Thirunavukkarasar said here on Saturday.
Pointing out that Mr. Mod rode to power promising that he would retrieve the black money stashed in Switzerland banks, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar claimed that instead of keeping his promise the Prime Minister had only put the hapless common man into trouble. Mr. Modi is acting like a dictator, he alleged.
The TNCC president was here to preside over a regional convention of the Congress party in which leaders and cadres from Tiruchi, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts participated in large numbers.
“When many people in rural areas are unaware of the various applications in the advanced mobile phones and use it to only talk, how come Mr. Modi fancies that rural masses would go in for mobile banking?” Mr. Thirunavukkarasar wondered. What would people in areas do where there was no banking service do, he asked.
Maintaining that the Congress was fighting for the welfare of the common man, the TNCC president exhorted his cadres to participate in the nationwide stir against the hazards of demonetisation slated for Monday by staging protests separately, just as the Left parties and the DMK were planning.
There were many in the BJP who were in total disagreement with the demonetisation and its fallout, the TNCC president said adding even the Supreme Court has counselled caution in that regard. Mr. Modi has forgotten that he is the Prime Minister and was acting like a dictator, he said.
The common man was not asking for Rs. 2,000 currency note but by introducing the high value currency, Mr. Modi has only facilitated those who were harbouring and hoarding black money leaving the commoners in the lurch. The Congress would fight for the welfare of the vulnerable sections, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar added.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/TNCC-flays-Modi-for-demonetisation/article16725155.ece,THANJAVUR
2016-11-27 01:08:00,Demonetisation aimed at U.P. polls: Mayawati,": Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said here on Saturday that demonetisation was a politically motivated move aimed at the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and other States. 
“This ill-planned decision has resulted in a financial emergency-like situation and created chaos in the country, which is condemnable. Ninety per cent of the country’s people are suffering from demonetisation — a decision which was immature and taken in a hurry,” Ms. Mayawati said at a press conference.
She said the decision was an attempt to divert public attention from the failure of the government to keep its election promises.
“But they [the BJP] would soon realise that this decision is only going to hit them badly. The BJP will suffer defeat in the upcoming Assembly elections in five States and later in the 2019 parliamentary elections as an outcome of the demonetisation. People will send them into political exile,” she said, adding that the Centre’s attitude was ‘dictatorial’ and it was making people suffer difficulties.

2016-11-27 00:00:00,Dairy farmers hit by demonetisation,"The demonetisation of high currency notes and restrictions on the withdrawal of cash from banks has hit the dairy farmers of Karimnagar, Rajanna-Sircilla, Jagtial and Peddapalli districts, falling under the jurisdiction of Karimnagar Milk Producer Company Limited.
The Karimnagar dairy debits Rs. 9 crore through banks every fortnight to milk producers as payment for procuring milk. But, the dairy farmers were unable to withdraw not more than Rs.24,000 per week from nationalised banks as they do not have Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to withdraw Rs.50,000 per week. The cooperative banks such as District Cooperative Central Banks (DCCB) and Telangana Grameena Bank (TGB) were providing cash not more than Rs.2,000 per week.
The Karimnagar dairy procures 1.8 lakh litres of milk daily from 924 villages (milk producer institutions) and makes online payment to each milk institution through banks. The milk producer institution president and manager of milk chilling unit have joint cheque withdraw powers from banks and distribute money to the milk famers in their respective villages.
The milk producer institution would be getting average fortnightly income of Rs.1.5 lakh to Rs.7.5 lakh, depending upon the supply of milk to the Karimnagar dairy. Each milk producer would get fortnightly income ranging from Rs.1,500 to Rs.10,000 and above. The demonetisation had become a cause of concern for the milk producers for purchasing essentials to eke out their living.
Director and milk producer Prabhakar Rao of Mamidipalli village in Konaraopeta mandal in Rajanna-Sircilla district said farmers are agaitated over non-payment of their milk bills due to demonetisation and are abusing the field staff.
Welcoming the demonetisation of high currency notes, Karimnagar Dairy chairman Ch. Rajeshwara Rao said that the decision had affected milk producers as they could not get their fortnightly income on time. However, we are taking all measures to ensure that the farmers get their payment at the earliest by talking to the banks concerned, he said, and added that they were also planning to open bank accounts to all the milk producers and make the online payment every fortnight.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Dairy-farmers-hit-by-demonetisation/article16725428.ece,KARIMNAGAR
2016-11-27 16:38:00,PIL seeks crackdown on laundering of money post-demonetisation," A PIL has been filed in the Allahabad High Court seeking crackdown on alleged laundering of black money in the aftermath of demonetisation through cash donations to religious institutions and charitable trusts, many of these run by political leaders.
The PIL filed by advocate Avinash Mani Tripathi, which is likely to come up for hearing before a bench later this week, alleges that there has been emergence of a “menace of converting black money into white through donation in cash” of “old high denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 in the accounts of religious and charitable trusts running across the country”.
The petitioner has contended that this would result in “failure” of government’s attempt to “eliminate black money” since donations made to religious institutions and trusts became a part of their income which was “exempt from tax”.
The petitioner has also alleged “inaction on part of Government of India to make any declaration regarding monetary effect of specified bank notes received in donation box or directly at religious institutions or trusts”.
It alleged that many of these were being “run by political leaders,” including those belonging to the ruling parties at the Centre and in the state.
The petitioner has mentioned the names of institutions or trusts run by BJP MPs, an Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister, a former Union Minister from Congress and an AIMIM leader.
The petitioner, who has named the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India as parties, has prayed for “directions to respondent authorities to declare that value of the old high denomination notes deposited in the accounts of religious institutions and trusts after November 08, 2016 would neither be credited nor exchanged”.
As an interim measure, pending hearing on the PIL, the petitioner has prayed for directions for “constitution of a high-level committee for taking appropriate action against the menace of converting black money into white through donation in cash of old denomination notes in the accounts of religious institutions and trusts across the country”.

2016-11-27 00:00:00,Demonetisation a courageous experiment by PM: Amar Singh,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move is a “courageous” experiment to eliminate black money, corruption and counterfeit currency, SP leader Amar Singh has said.
Though it was implemented without making “proper arrangements”, but sudden implementation of the move helped preventing “adjustment” of black money and unaccounted cash by hoarders, he said here.
Mr. Singh also said, “He as a countryman was proud to have such Prime Minister who was so dedicated and adamant to root out corruption.”
“The people standing in queues outside banks are saying that the Prime Minister has punished all who have amassed huge wealth, whether they are from his party (BJP) or others,” he said and claimed that now they (black money hoarders) are getting “sleepless nights“.
Mr. Singh claimed the move has reduced the gap between rich and the poor and now people would pay taxes instead of evading them.
“I am not a BJP spokesperson but a SP Rajya Sabha member, whatever the opinion of my party might be on the issue but I have shared my personal view on it,” he said.
However, he registered his protest against the mismanagement in implementing the demonetisation move, saying he was pained to the see people suffering due to it.
“What is the purpose of implementing a scheme due to which poor, farmers, small traders and common people have to suffer?” he said. - PTI",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Demonetisation-a-courageous-experiment-by-PM-Amar-Singh/article16725348.ece,Varanasi
2016-11-27 00:00:00,Rawat asks Centre to help Uttarakhand deal with demonetisation,"Describing Uttarakhand as a small State suffering from resource crunch, Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Friday asked the Centre to take necessary steps to help the State deal with the adverse effects of demonetisation on tourism and agriculture.
In a letter to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he said demonetisation could be a good step so far as black money was concerned but adequate preparatory measures should have been taken prior to the move.
“Sudden demonetisation of high value currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 without adequate preparatory steps has adversely impacted agriculture, tourism and overall revenue generation in a small State like Uttarakhand.
“Demonetisation is weighing heavy on a State already battling the losses caused by the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission,” Mr. Rawat said.
Noting that a vast majority of people living in remote hill areas of the State depended on the cooperative banking system, he said exclusion of cooperative banks from any transactions (deposits and exchange) of the banned notes had put the rural populace, dependent on agriculture, in a tight spot as the sowing season was already underway and they had no cash to buy seeds and fertilisers.
Noting that the current crisis might result in failure of rabi crop and subsequent rise in foodgrain prices, Mr. Rawat asked the Union Minister to allow cooperative banks to accept deposits of banned notes.
Paucity of cash has led to a drop in sale, exchange of goods and services and affected tourism in general. It has had a negative impact on the state government’s sources of income, including VAT collections, he said.
Also noting that demonetisation will lead to a rise in the Centre’s earnings through collection of direct and indirect taxes, the Chief Minister said the benefits should be shared with the States. - PTI",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Rawat-asks-Centre-to-help-Uttarakhand-deal-with-demonetisation/article16725351.ece,Dehradun

Though several political parties are protesting against it, both within and outside Parliament, the MDMK welcomes the move, said its leader Vaiko in Coimbatore on Saturday.
Addressing journalists outside the airport en route Erode, he said that it was unfair to target the Prime Minister on the issue.
The element of secrecy and surprise was necessary for the demonetisation move.
But there were issues in the implementation and the government must address those.

Water sharing

On the river-water sharing issue, Mr. Vaiko said that the Punjab Government’s refusal to share water with Haryana and Rajasthan ought to be condemned.
Upper riparian states should not be allowed to enjoy all the water and if this was allowed, tomorrow Karnataka could cite it as precedent to deny Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu.
The Central Government should therefore act in an impartial manner to provide equitable water to all riparian states.",Coimbatore,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/MDMK-welcomes-demonetisation-Vaiko/article16725157.ece,COIMBATORE
2016-11-27 00:34:00,Demonetisation: 11 cops in the dock for corruption,": It has been just over a fortnight since the demonetisation scheme was announced and already at least 11 Delhi Police personnel are facing legal or disciplinary action for their alleged involvement in violations linked to cash.
The most recent violation was reported on November 25, when an inspector and his three sub-ordinates, all from the outer district, were accused of siphoning off Rs. 10 lakh from a man caught with Rs. 30 lakh in the banned currencies. The accused have been sent to the District Lines.
On the sly
Two days before that, a couple of FIRs were registered against seven policemen in similar cases.
In one of the cases, four policemen allegedly forced a garbage collector to part with Rs.25 lakh of the Rs. 26.7 lakh that he had found at a dump yard. An inquiry has revealed that the accused — station house officer of the Jahangirpuri police station and his three junior colleagues — did not inform their seniors about the raid and tried to pocket the money themselves. In this case, too, the cash recovered was in the old notes.
All four accused have been transferred.
Man threatened
In another case, an FIR was registered against three traffic police constables for allegedly attempting to rob a man of Rs. 1.2 lakh. The man was carrying the cash in the banned denominations and the policemen had allegedly threatened to implicate him in a criminal case. 
In a quandary
Despite the complainant’s repeated requests that the money was meant for a wedding in his family, the constables had forced him to hand over the money to them. They had later returned the cash.

2016-11-27 21:15:00,TS Cabinet to go into huddletoday on demonetisation," The Council of Ministers of Telangana will meet at the Secretariat on Monday afternoon to discuss the post-demonetisation issues and the situation arising out of the Centre's decision.
According to officials, the meeting to be chaired by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would also discuss the measures to be taken to address problems arising out of the demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes. Revenue collection in the State, both tax revenue and non-tax revenue, has gone down drastically following the Centre's decision.
It was stated that the revenue from commercial taxes, excise, registration and stamps, motor vehicles and others had taken a severe beating, although the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, other local bodies, and the Hyderabad Metro Water Supply & Sewerage Board had netted notable income as people were allowed to clear their dues in demonetised currency notes.
As for their collections, the GHMC has netted over Rs.246 crore and gram panchayats about Rs. 51 crore. Two power distribution companies, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority and others have also collected some revenue, which otherwise would have been remained unpaid. 
Sources said the Cabinet meeting would focus on the steps to be taken to improve revenue from sectors such as real estate as it was linked to many other sectors. The meeting was also expected to zero in on the next Chief Secretary of the State as incumbent Rajiv Sharma will be demitting office on November 30.
Five-member panel
At a review meeting held with senior officials on Sunday, the Chief Minister observed that the Government could not remain a mute spectator to the situation arising out of the demonetisation. “There cannot be any stalemate in transactions since it concerns lakhs of people in the State,” he said. 
The Chief Minister constituted a five-member committee with senior IAS officers to work out modalities for preparing a policy towards cashless transactions (e-payment). The panel includes Principal Secretary Suresh Chanda, Secretaries Navin Mittal and Jayesh Ranjan and District Collectors M. Raghunandan Rao (Ranga Reddy) and Surendra Mohan (Suryapet). Secretary in the CMO A. Santi Kumari would represent the CMO on the committee.
The Committee would prepare a job chart to the Collectors in the face of situations such as demonetisation. The Chief Minister asked the Chief Secretary to instruct the Collectors to involve bankers in making people move towards cashless transactions in future. He asked Finance Secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao to prepare a detailed note on the impact and other aspects of the demonetisation and table it before the Cabinet on Monday.

2016-11-28 23:31:00,Opposition holds protests against demonetisation ,"Opposition parties organised protests across the country on Monday against the Centre’s demonetisation move but normal life was not affected in most parts, except in Kerala and Tripura, two Left-ruled States.
The biggest protest was perhaps held in Kolkata, where West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took to the streets against the Centre.
Leading a massive rally along a three-kilometre stretch in the city, Ms. Banerjee, who has sought a rollback of the demonetisation, vowed to “remove Narendra Modi from Indian politics.”
Draped in her trademark white cotton saree, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chairperson said at the end of the rally: “Whether I live or die, I will make Indian politics free of Modi.” “Cashless, or faceless... we have a leader who is faceless and baseless,” she said, adding, “Even Hitler would not have thought of such a thing.”
After the rally, Ms. Banerjee left for Lucknow where she will hold protests over the next two days.
In Kerala, public transport was off the road while shops, markets and commercial establishments were shut, impacting both the formal and informal sectors.
As the Opposition held countrywide protests against demonetisation on Monday, in Kerala the ruling Left Democratic Front, which had called the hartal, had exempted the tourism sector and banks from the strike. However attendance in banks was low and tourists had a difficult time moving around and getting food.
In Tripura, the 12-hour general strike call got a complete response with schools, colleges and shops remaining closed. There were clashes between CPI(M) and BJP workers in some parts of south Tripura.
But in the rest of the country, including the national capital, the ‘Jan Aakrosh’ did not disrupt normal life.
In Tamil Nadu, normal life was not affected during protests organised separately by the Left parties, the DMK and the Congress.
In all, 3,409 persons were detained in the morning from across five locations in Chennai and were freed by evening. Among those detained were Opposition leader M.K. Stalin and former Union Minister T.R. Baalu, both of the DMK. In Telangana, with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the MIM, which has a significant influence over Hyderabad, staying away from the protests, there was little impact on the daily life of citizens.
While the Left and the Congress organised protests in various parts, most schools and colleges were open. Shops and establishments in commercial areas also functioned normally.
The same was the case in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Bihar. Opposition parties organised protests without disrupting life. In Lucknow, barring stray protest marches and poorly attended dharnas by the Congress and the Left, the protests received little support from the people. The Congress led the ‘Jan Aakrosh’ marches in Lucknow and other district headquarters with the party’s chief ministerial candidate, Sheila Dikshit, leading a march in Kanpur. In Bihar, the ruling party JD(U) stayed away from the protests but its alliance partners, the RJD and the Congress, took to the streets.

2016-11-28 18:58:00,Demonetisation: General strike total in Tripura," The twelve-hour general strike to protest against demonetisation of high value currencies evoked total response in Tripura. Four Left parties, including the CPI(M), called the strike on Monday to highlight ‘infinite sufferings of people’ following the ban of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes.
The day, however, witnessed a clash between the CPI(M) and the BJP workers at Amarpur in south Tripura. The CPI(M) claimed that eight party workers were injured in ‘unprovoked attack’ on its procession.
The BJP aggressively campaigned against the dawn-to-dusk strike, but to no avail. The call completely paralysed life, business and vehicular traffic, while government offices did not function due to nonattendance of staffs.
Chief Minister Manik Sarkar and a few ministers worked from the Secretariat which had a very thin presence of employees. Chief Secretary Yaspal Singh and secretaries also attended office on Monday.
The Left parties also decided to hold protests in front of the Central government offices to register their ire against demonetisation. Left Front State Committee Chairman Khagen Das said the week-long protest is taking place in all 23 sub-divisions of the State.
Police said around 200 supporters of the BJP, the CPI(M) and the SUCI were arrested in the State for defying prohibitory orders. They were released in the afternoon.
Besides the BJP, the Trinamool Congress and the Congress opposed the strike, but they were not active on the streets. The TMC took out a procession at the end of strike to condemn the decision of the BJP-led NDA government to withdrawal the high-value notes and causing sufferings of common people.
Banking sector and post offices were kept out of purview of strike to help people deal with money matters.

2016-11-28 16:26:00,PM ready to speak on demonetisation; Opposition unimpressed ," Seeking to break the deadlock, Home Minister Rajnath Singht on Monday told the Lok Sabha that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will speak on demonetisation if the Opposition wanted, but the rival parties demanding debate with a provision for voting remained unimpressed, forcing the House to adjourn for the second time.
A number of opposition leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge (Cong.), Sudip Bandhopadhyay (TMC) and Mulayam Singh Yadav (SP), spoke as they pressed for acceptance of their demand for an adjournment motion, a condition not acceptable to the Treasury benches which want a debate without voting.
With the Opposition parties firm on their stand, Mr. Singh said nobody is questioning the government’s intentions over demonetisation or imputing any mala fide.
He said that the government was willing to listen to the complaints and suggestions different parties have over the execution of the demonetisation move.
“As far as the Prime Minister coming to the House is concerned, if the Opposition wants he will come and intervene. I want to assure the Opposition. We are ready for a discussion,” the Home Minister said during the Zero Hour, after the Opposition leaders spoke.
The decision on under which rule the discussion would take place is for the Speaker to make, he said.
Demonetisation is a “historic, bold and pro-poor” decision, Mr. Singh said, adding that it was taken to target black money and was in national interest.
However, members of a dissatisfied Opposition rushed to the Well, forcing Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to adjourn the House till 1400 hours.
Earlier, Mr. Kharge said demonetisation had harmed the economic system, the farmers, youths, labourers and women among others who are in distress.
Maintaining that over 70 people have died due to the faulty implementation, he cited the incident of a Union Minister facing difficulty in paying hospital bills after his brother died and said it is an evidence of the crisis. Union Minister Sadananda Gowda’s brother had died in Karnataka.
“There is only one way to break this deadlock. The Prime Minister should come here (to the House) and our adjournment motion be accepted,” Mr. Kharge said.
Mr. Bandhopadhyay said the government must take initiative to break the impasse as people will ask what does Parliament stand for, if it is adjourned everyday.
Supporting Mr. Kharge, the SP chief said if Mr. Modi does not come to the House on such an important matter, then when he will come. Farmers are facing a lot of problems, he said.
Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) called the decision impractical and anti-people.
An AIADMK member said the government should take initiative to ease people’s sufferings, while B. Mahtab (BJD) said the onus was on the Centre to take steps to break the impasse.
Anandrao Adsul (Shiv Sena) said neither ‘Bharat Bandh’ nor ’Aakrosh Diwas’, which different opposition parties have announced for Monday, was visible but lamented that the recent announcement of NABARD disbursing Rs. 21,000 crore to cooperative banks has not been implemented. Situation remains bad in rural areas, he said.
When the Lok Sabha met again at 2 p.m. after adjournment, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley rose to introduce a bill to amend the Income Tax Act allow authorities impose 75 per cent tax and 10 per cent penalty in case they detect undisclosed wealth deposited post demonetisation.
Members from the opposition parties, who were asking the Speaker to take up their adjournment motion on note ban, rushed to the Well raising slogans. Mr. Jaitley then introduced the bill amid din.
The din and slogan shouting against the government continued for another few minutes and the House was adjourned for the day, 10 minutes past 2 p.m.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/PM-ready-to-speak-on-demonetisation-Opposition-unimpressed/article16715147.ece,New Delhi

The Congress, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) members trooped into the Well shouting slogans against the government, forcing proceedings to be adjourned first for 30 minutes and then till noon.
Soon after the House mourned the death of Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and the listed papers were laid, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said nationwide protest is being observed on Monday against demonetisation that has caused hardships to common man.
‘All India Protest’, Aakrosh Diwas said, has been called to highlight the hardships. As Mr. Aakrosh Diwas raised the issue other opposition leaders, including Mayawati (BSP), Derek O’Brien (TMC), Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), Anand Sharma (Cong.) joined in.
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the nation was seething in anger over the hardship and harrassment caused because of the announcement made by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016.
Soon the Congress and the TMC members trooped into the well of the House shouting slogans against the Prime Minister. Ruling benches also joined him by shouting slogans favouring start of a discussion on the issue.
I&B Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu rose to state that the discussion which had started on the opening day of the winter session of Parliament on November 16 and has not yet concluded, should be resumed, instead of such disruption of proceedings.
Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien agreed with the suggestion of Mr. Naidu but the din continued, forcing him to adjourn the proceedings for half an hour.
When the House met after adjournment, the Opposition was again on their feet shouting slogans like ‘Janta Ka Paisa Janta Ko Do’ (Give money to the people, it is theirs).
Deputy Chairman Mr. Kurien insisted that the discussion on the demonetisation be resumed, when Mr. Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M) asked “Why is the Prime Minister not coming (to the House)?”
“You start. The Prime Minister will come. How do you know that the Prime Minister will not come,” Mr. Kurien said, adding that it is already on the record that the Prime Minister will speak on the issue.
As the Opposition members kept shouting slogans in the Well, the Chair adjourned the House till noon.
When the House reassembled at noon for Question Hour, Leader of Opposition and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said he wanted to “make it clear” that 18 Opposition parties have decided to observe ‘Jan Akrosh Divas’ on Monday.
“We did not discuss anything on Bharat Bandh. If anyone has raised the issue of Bharat Bandh, it is the Prime Minister. He is responsible for Bharat Bandh.
“We are observing this day as ‘Jan Aakrosh Divas’ to raise the ‘aakrosh’ (anguish) across the country. There is ’aakrosh’ (anger) among the youth, the women and the old against this new policy of demonetisation,” Mr. Azad said, adding that so far 75 people have lost their lives due to the government’s decision to go for demonetisation.
The senior Congress leader also said a 96-year-old man had died while standing in a queue outside a bank in Chennai and also the death of a young girl who did not have money for her wedding.
Earlier, when Mr. Ansari allowed Mr. Azad to speak, Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu rose to take up an issue saying, “We need to raise a point.”
Mr. Ansari, however, said the floor has already been given to Mr. Azad and if the government has a point it would be allowed later.
Amid the din raised by treasury benches, Chairman Hamid Ansari adjourned the proceedings till 1400 hours “because the House is not being allowed to run.”
When the House met again at 2 p.m., Commerce Minister Nirmala Sithraman placed a notification on behalf of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley providing for exemption of central excise duty for the manufacture of PoS devices (Point of Sale).
Soon after this, SP leader Naresh Aggarwal raised a Point of Order. As he started, he made certain comments about the Treasury Benches which was objected to.
Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien eventually expunged the remark after listening to both the sides.
Later, Congress leader Anand Sharma raised a Point of Order, saying the Constitution specifically says that a person cannot be deprived of his property by the government.
He questioned how then the government is depriving the country and the common man of their own money in the bank accounts by limiting withdrawals.
He said nearly 80 people have died due to demonitisation move while standing in queues.
“It is illegal and there is no law under which this has been done,” Mr. Sharma said.
“Even the Constitution does not allow the Prime Minister or the government to deprive the citizens of their money and property, especially bank accounts. Not one bill was tabled in the House. The Prime Minister and the government must answer,” he said.
Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said such an important decision was announced after the Session was called for and before it actually began.
This is the first time when such an announcement has been made and the Prime Minister has not given a statement in the Parliament, Mr. Azad said.
He said the opposition has demanded discussion over the move to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in both the Houses, but in the presence of the Prime Minister since he has announced the move.
He said some are saying that the Cabinet was not informed and even the Finance Minister did not know.
“Then how can he (Finance Minister) reply to the points raised by us. Prime Minister should be here,” Mr. Azad said.
Taking a dig at Mr. Modi, he said he can even come to the Parliament Library for events and address every rally in Uttar Pradesh but can’t come to the House.
As Congress’ sloganeering followed, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the government is ready for discussion like always.
“You failed with your ‘Aakrosh Diwas’ on the streets, so now you are disrupting the House proceedings,” he said.
Following the ruckus, Mr. Kurien adjourned the House till Tuesday morning.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Opposition-protests-over-demonetisation-continue-in-Rajya-Sabha/article16715120.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-28 00:00:00,TDP membership drive hit by demonetisation in TS,"Demonetisation of the higher denomination currency notes appears to have its telling impact on the Telugu Desam Party.
The demonetisation exercise initiated by the Central Government and thereby, the shortage of smaller denomination of currency notes, has reportedly slowed down the party’s ongoing membership drive at least in Telangana. With the deadline for enrolment as members coming to a close on November 30, the party could register names of 1.76 lakh active members till date. This is in stark contrast to the conservative target of enrolling 14.17 lakh members as part of the ongoing drive.
Coupled with the demonetisation issue is the Group II examination held last week. Several youth enrolled as operators to collate the membership data and host it online too could not complete the job in time. Senior leaders of the TDP as well as the party president and Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu acknowledged the significant drop in the membership numbers at an extended meeting of the TDP Telangana general body here on Sunday. “The enrolment last time was 54 lakh members and this time it is 32 lakh members. Demonetisation definitely had its impact on the party, but this will be a temporary phenomenon,” Mr. Naidu said addressing the general body. The party reportedly faced difficulties in enrolling members as the fee of Rs. 100 for each member is hard to come by owing to the shortage of the currency denomination in the market. Outlining the difficulties faced in fulfilling the target, senior leaders like E. Peddi Reddy, who is coordinating the process, asked Mr. Naidu to extend the deadline. Mr. Naidu, however, asked them to focus on accelerating the process and submit a report by November 30 based on which a decision could be taken.

2016-11-28 00:00:00,Union govt. criticised for demonetisation,"Members of the Congress Kisan Khet Mazdoor wing of the District Congress took out a procession and staged a dharna at Onake Obavva Circle on Sunday to protest against the Union government decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes “without preparation.”
The agitators took out a procession from B.R. Ambedkar Circle – which passed through the main streets of the city – that culminated at Onake Obavva Circle. They also raised slogans against the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The agitators alleged that the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has put farmers, daily wage workers and dealers of seeds and fertilizers in trouble as they are now unable to purchase materials required for agricultural activities. The dealers of seeds and fertilizers are not ready to accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes from farmers who come to purchase the material, they alleged.
After standing in long queues to exchange notes in banks and post offices, farmers have only been successful in getting some notes of Rs. 2,000 denomination. However, the problems of farmers have further worsened as the dealers refuse to take Rs. 2,000 notes, as they cannot offer change in return, they alleged.
Keeping in view the inconvenience caused to people, the Union government should immediately withdraw its order on the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, they demanded.
The agitation was led by District Congress Committee president Fathya Rajan.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Union-govt.-criticised-for-demonetisation/article16726000.ece,Chitradurga
2016-11-28 07:45:00,Vaiko justifies demonetisation move yet again ," Differing yet again with his three allies, MDMK leader Vaiko continued to strongly justify Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, saying it was a strategic blow delivered by the latter against corrupt and black money holders in the country. Incidentally, his allies — the CPI, the CPI (M) and the VCK — have extended full-throated support to Monday’s nationwide strike against the demonetisation move.
Mr. Vaiko has contended that there was no need for him to conform to the views of the other parties in the People’s Welfare Front (PWF) as all the political parties could not have similar views on all issues,” Mr. Vaiko told The Hindu on Sunday.
“For instance, there is no uniform view among the PWF partners on the LTTE. We agree to disagree on some issues. When Mr. Modi made the announcement on demonetisation, I immediately welcomed it. Contrary to popular perception, the common man had welcomed the demonetisation move. I am not saying this from ivory tower. I am meeting and mingling with ordinary people and those who are on the edge of society on day-to-day basis. While as [former Union Finance Minister] P. Chidambaram said, though they are not eating fruits every day, they do feel it is a good move aimed at eradicating black money,” Mr. Vaiko said.
Even though he agreed that a section of society and traders was facing hardships, he said one had to swallow bitter bills to cure the disease. “The situation will become normal in 30 days and people will see the result of Mr. Modi’s efforts,” he said.
When asked what was the point in printing Rs 2,000 notes when higher denomination currencies were said to have contributed to black money in a big way, Mr Vaiko claimed if the government had printed smaller denominations like Rs. 100, the black money holders would have got wind of the government’s plan.

2016-11-28 00:00:00,"Demonetisation, a war on people: CPI(M)","Dubbing demonetisation as a “war on the people”, CPI(M) State secretary Ramakrishnan on Sunday said the move defied the conclusions of the survey conducted by the Central Government’s own Central Board of Direct Taxes in 2012 that dismissed demonetisation as a possible check on black money. Further, only eight per cent of the GDP entailed cashless transactions while the rest were through cash, he said.
In retrospect, the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI governor made sense as he never would have supported the move, the CPM leader alleged.
According to him, it was preposterous to dub those who oppose demonetisation as hoarders of black money, alluding to criticism of the opposition condemning Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Uttam Kumar said that demonetisation of high-value currency has aggravated the agrarian crisis and demanded that the State government take immediate steps to ensure that farmers do not lose the ongoing Rabi season.
Mr. Reddy, who visited Achampet in Nagarkurnool district to address ‘Rythu Garjana’ rally on Sunday, said farmers were already in crisis due to non-clearance of their crop loan waiver dues by the State government. They lost four consecutive crops due to drought situation. In view of good rainfall, farmers were expecting a good Rabi season. However, their hopes were lost when the BJP government at the Centre announced demonetisation without realising that the process would overlap Kharif harvest and Rabi sowing season hitting lakhs of farmers. He asked the State government to extend immediate assistance to farmers to ensure that they do not fall short of funds to carry out sowing operations.
Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that the Telangana State Level Bankers Committee, in its recent meeting, has admitted that a very small percentage of proposed Rs. 11,300 crore was disbursed to farmers towards Rabi loans. Further, with the State government not clearing the dues under promised Rs. 1 lakh crop loan waiver scheme has completely denied farmers an opportunity to avail fresh loans.

With the ruling party TRS (Telangana Rashtra Samiti) and the MIM (Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen), which has a significant influence over city, staying away from any kind of street protests on Monday, the State and Central government offices functioned without much disruption. 
Most of the schools and colleges in the city conducted classes for their students.

2016-11-28 20:57:00,Weddings in the time of demonetisation,"Abilash M.A. from Iritty in Kannur will never forget his wedding, not in the conventional sense but since it put him in a huge debt, which he is not sure of remitting in the near future.
Mr. Abhilash is one unfortunate expatriate who was struck hard by demonetisation, especially since he had come on leave from Dubai only for his wedding, which took place on November 16, barely a week after demonetisation was implemented in the country. At the time, every individual was allowed to withdraw only Rs.10,000 from an account a day.
“Fortunately for me,” Mr. Abhilash said, “we were done with all the cloth and jewellery purchases by November 8. But I really struggled to manage the remaining expenses like the vehicle charges, cooks charges and the previous day’s function.”
But the goodness of the rural people became a blessing for him in the dire circumstances. “I had known most of these people all my life. Hence many of them agreed to render their services on condition that I would pay them later,” he said adding that now he is withdrawing money from the bank every week to pay for their services. 
“I had no time to spend with my bride. Every one in the family, including my bride, stands in queue on a daily basis so that I can pay those people whom I owe, before I go back to Dubai,” Mr. Abhilash said.
At Guruvayur
His is not a lone experience. Most people who had planned wedding in the months of November and December had to go through a lot of hurdles. 
Sudhakaran E., a retired BSNL employee from Thondayad, organised his daughter’s wedding on November 23. His fault was that he had deposited all his retirement benefits in a cooperative bank. When the demonetisation stuck, he was unable to withdraw a single rupee. 
Fortunately for him, the wedding was held at the Guruvayur Sreekrishna temple and the expenses were very low. “We purchased the gold using debit cards. For the rest, everyone in the family withdrew Rs.20,000 each and within two weeks, we had enough money to conduct the wedding,” Mr. Sudhakaran said.
Though there was a provision to withdraw Rs.2.5 lakh with the District Collector’s permission, Mr. Sudhakaran did not need it.

2016-11-28 00:00:00,Demonetisation: Unions demand salary in cash,"Post-demonetisation, some of the trade bodies, including railway employees’ unions and Tamil Nadu State Transport employees’ union, have demanded that the salary payable in December be paid in cash to their members and not through regular electronic clearance.
The Centre has put a cap on daily withdrawal from the ATMs at Rs. 2,500. “If lakhs of railway men stand in the queue on December 1 for withdrawing money at the ATMs and banks, it will only add to the existing problem,” said Southern Railway Mazdoor Union general secretary N. Kannaiah. He said only the salaried class would be affected as their salary was deposited in banks. Traders carried out money transactions every day and had easy access to currencies of smaller values. “How does the government expect ‘running’ staff like me (a railway guard) to stand in queue for a whole day to withdraw money,” asked divisional secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union R. Sankaranarayanan.
However, he was quick to add that the very demand for disbursement of entire salary in cash was only to put some pressure on the government.
The union leaders said the payment of salary advance of Rs. 10,000 made on Thursday was only because of their demand.
M. Nandasingh, national council member of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), said his organisation had urged the heads of all 21 transport corporations in the State to stop remittance of daily collections in banks.
“The money of smaller denominations could be used to make salary payment to transport corporation employees,” he said.
Stating that disbursement of salary through electronic clearance has been done only for the last eight years, he said the standing order of transport corporation was payment of salary in cash.
However, a bank official said it was highly impossible to provide cash for entire salary of the Central Government and State Government employees in view of the cash crunch faced by the banks.
“The ceiling on withdrawal of Rs. 24,000 a week stands good for all for the simple reason that we do not have cash. Besides, salary disbursement through cash will defeat the very idea of the Union Government to encourage transactions through banks,” he said.",Madurai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Demonetisation-Unions-demand-salary-in-cash/article16726190.ece,Madurai

“The Opposition leaders who were asking what [Narendra] Modi has done about black money till the evening of November 8, changed their tone suddenly and started asking why Mr. Modi had done this [demonetisation],” he said.

“It is a flood-like situation where you find one tree in the middle on which rats, cats, mongooses, and snakes have climbed to save themselves from the gushing water,” Mr. Shah said.

2016-11-28 23:24:00,‘Demonetisation will not hit IT sector hard’,"The demonetisation of high-value currency notes will have only a minor impact on the revenues of the outward-facing IT industry, asserted Shiva Ramani, CEO of iOPEX Technologies, a San Jose-based company engaged in providing optimised IT management services. Founded in 2009, iOpex has a large presence in Chennai.
Since most of these firms were in the tax bracket and part of the banking system, the demonetisation impact had been low on them, Mr. Shiva Ramani said. “There is excitement for us, however. What if this drive increases tax compliance? What if this brings down corporate tax? It will be a phenomenal boom for us,” he added. He termed the demonetisation exercise a “very bold move.”
He, however, said he would not hazard a guess as to whether it would pan out to be good or bad. “How good or how bad is the next question. But being decisive is in itself a big change from the last 10 years,” he added.
“In the long-term, India will be a very viable market. And, if cashless or declared income becomes the middle of the pyramid, then all of us have a lot to gain,” he said.
On the near-term impact of demonetisation, he said “economic activity will be significantly suppressed in the short-term. Rupee will further depreciate against world currencies.” However, he felt that some of these shocks could be manageable since the oil prices “are still marginal”.
If the revenue was dollar-denominated, it would help the IT firms as their rupee revenue would go up significantly, he said.

IT outsourcing will have marginal impact especially when local workforce is replaced by H1 workers as a part of large outsourcing deal involving offshore and onshore. But, in general, as the broader stock market is showing, it is overall going to be lot more business-friendly. As such, U.S. business will spend more and the knock on effect of more IT spend will happen.'' He said that the American democracy had got a lot of checks and balances.

2016-11-28 22:52:00,"Sovereign, pension funds line up to invest post demonetisation","In a positive outcome of the demonetisation exercise and black money clampdown, ‘Invest India’ — the government’s investment promotion & facilitation agency – has been flooded with queries from foreign pension funds and Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) regarding locations and sectors to invest in the country. Encouraged by this trend, ‘Invest India’ has decided to set up a dedicated team of experts by mid-December this year to cater to the needs of SWFs (state-owned investment entities) and foreign public & private pension funds and attract mega investments into India, Invest India’s Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Deepak Bagla told The Hindu. Road shows will be held soon across the world explaining how the demonetisation policy and the Goods & Services Tax legislation will ensure ease of doing business in India in a “clean manner” for SWFs and pension funds who have ‘ethical investment’ norms, he said.
The world’s 300 largest pension funds had assets under management totalling $14.8 trillion in 2015, said Willis Towers Watson, a global advisory, broking and solutions company. Also, as of December 2015, SWFs accounted for $7.4 trillion in assets, while sovereign pension funds totalled $ 4.2 trillion, it said. For ‘ethical investments’, SWFs and foreign pension funds have high transparency and governance standards, and have to stick to their internal norms on anti-corruption and anti-bribery. India, which needs more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade for infrastructure funding, will be relying on these funds to ensure there is no shortfall. Union government sources told The Hindu that during discussions including those relating to India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), the SWFs and foreign pension funds had informed the government that they will be more comfortable investing in India if there is greater transparency in doing business, especially in the real estate & construction sectors where there is prevalence of cash transactions and influence of black money. Claiming that the black money cleanup will eventually strengthen the Indian Rupee, the sources said measures to ensure tax policy certainty, remove red-tape and prevent corruption are aimed at improving investor confidence, reducing their cost of funds and other transaction costs, in turn leading to greater Return on Investment.
“The Indian economy has many positives, but the ‘post-truth’ – or statements relying more on general belief and less on objective facts – being circulated was so negative that these SWFs and pension funds have been reluctant to invest. The Investment Committees of these funds had concerns,” Mr. Bagla said. So far, India used to get only a portion of the funds allocated in the ‘emerging economy basket’ by the private equity players, but with the demonetisation and GST removing their apprehensions, they will hopefully set up a ‘country dedicated fund’ to make greater investments in India, he added. Once the SWFs and pension funds decide to step up their operations in India, the companies they have investments in, will also follow suit – leading to a multiplier effect, Mr. Bagla said. The SWFs in countries such as Norway, Canada, Singapore, US, Qatar and UAE have been making sector-specific enquiries prior to the demonetisation announcement as well as after it, but the SWFs from South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Iran have done so after the demonetisation policy, the sources said. The NIIF, itself a quasi-SWF with a maximum government-holding of 49 per cent, will focus on commercially viable projects particularly in the infrastructure sector. It will see participation from foreign pension funds and SWFs as the government had held talks with SWFs like Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Qatar Investment Authority as well as the Russian state-owned private equity & venture capital vehicle ‘Rusnano’.",Economy,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Sovereign-pension-funds-line-up-to-invest-post-demonetisation/article16716804.ece,NEW DElhI

Addressing the media at the 69th NCC Day celebration held in the premises of the NCC Group Head Quarters in Puducherry, the Lt. Governor said that the banks were now in a better position to lend money. 
“We can invest in infrastructure to provide better healthcare, roads and transport facilities. We are looking at the long-term benefit. This is like a ‘maha yug’. Each one of us has contributed in our own way,” she said.

She added that the initiative was a united effort and was succeeding. “There is discomfort but there will be no joy without discomfort,” she said.
Ms. Bedi announced that the Raj Nivas would work hand-in-hand with the NCC Group Head Quarters of Puducherry under Col. Satish Kumar Gupta to adopt a village or fishermen colony to make it ‘digital’ and ‘swachh’.

2016-11-28 21:51:00,Parties unite over demonetisation protests,"BENGALURU: The Aakrosh Diwas called by the opposition parties against demonetisation on Monday went off peacefully and was marked by demonstrations across the State even as BJP observed the day as Sambram Diwas. Barring traffic snarls on some roads in the Central Business District in Bengaluru, normal life and the transport sector remained unaffected.
In Bengaluru, the members of the ruling Congress party staged a protest in front of Town Hall in which KPCC Working President Dinesh Gundu Rao took part. Traffic was affected for some time. 
Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said, “We are not against demonetisation, but are upset that the BJP government did not make any preparations in advance before announcing the decision.""
The Joint committee of Left Parties (CPI, CPI-M, CPI-ML, SUCI-C), Bengaluru staged a demonstration at Mysore Bank Circle. They claimed that demonetisation has put crores of common people in misery on a daily basis ever since it was announced, said a press release.
However, shops and other establishments were open. “There was no drop in the number of commuters,” said an official from the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation. 
BJP activists distributed sweets across the city and thanked the public for supporting the decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Good response in Shikaripura
Even as the BJP observed Monday as Sambram Diwas welcoming the demonetising move, Shikaripura, the home turf of BJP State unit President B.S. Yeddyurappa, seems to have responded to the Aakrosh Diwas called by the combined opposition. Shops, commercial establishments, including hotels and rice mills, remained closed in the town. Educational institutions and government offices functioned, but with thin attendance.

2016-11-28 00:03:00,Demonetisation and its discontents,"Demonetisation seems to have made friends of foes, and foes of friends in the political firmament. If Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar differed from his allies while heaping praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for embarking on demonetisation, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was critical of his party’s senior partner in government for “bringing tears in the eyes of the people” who had voted it to power. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress showed a readiness to join hands with arch-rival Left Front to fight the demonetisation drive. While the withdrawal of high-denomination notes can hardly be expected to trigger a political realignment anywhere, political parties seem to be rising above mundane political calculations while reacting to the demonetisation. A cynical view might be that Mr. Kumar is keeping his political options open by building bridges with the BJP, and keeping his politically junior but numerically stronger ally, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, in check. Arguably, he could be trying to recover his assiduously cultivated anti-corruption image, which took a beating following his electoral pact with Lalu Prasad of the RJD. But a simpler explanation cannot be ruled out: that Mr. Kumar saw some merit in the demonetisation drive, even as he recognised the difficulties in implementation. Similarly, the Sena cannot afford to break with the BJP at this juncture. Quite likely, Mr. Thackeray was prompted not by the possibilities of political realignment (of which there is practically none), but by the realities on the ground, in distancing himself and his party from the demonetisation decision. In West Bengal, an alliance between the Trinamool and the Left Front is inconceivable, but that did not stop Ms. Banerjee from reaching out to the CPI(M) in her fight.
If political parties have thus reacted unpredictably, it could just be on account of the mixed results seen on the ground. None can afford to be seen as directly opposing measures to clean up black money and weed out counterfeits. However, stories of cashless banks and shuttered ATMs seem to have given some life to opposition parties looking for an issue to pin the government down on. Reports of the BJP having made huge cash deposits in banks in West Bengal, and land deals in Bihar days before the demonetisation, have provided some ammunition to opposition parties that were initially reluctant to criticise the move for fear of being labelled supporters of black money hoarders and counterfeiters. Demonetisation might not have changed political equations, but it has shaken up the political scene. What they cannot oppose in principle, parties have opposed in practice.",Editorial,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Demonetisation-and-its-discontents/article16711521.ece,

2016-11-28 19:11:00,Demonetisation woes: Fishermen keep off sea," With demonetisation hitting fish trade in the coastal regions of Thanjavur, fishermen in the district have decided to keep off the sea. Alleging that cash crunch has prohibited fish traders from buying the sparse catch, they have demanded easing of cash restriction on withdrawals for fishermen and traders so that fishing activity continues.
Fishing is the main vocation in the coastal towns of Sethubavachatram, Mallipattinam and Kallivayal Thottam areas. From here more than 2,000 fishermen set off in more than 300 mechanised fibre boats to indulge in deep sea fishing. 
When the Central Government announced the demonetisation measures on November 8, the cash crunch forced the fishermen to declare a strike on November 10 and 19. When the Centre eased some restrictions on withdrawals and payments at fuel stations, many fishermen started venturing into the sea from November 20.
But the same withdrawal limit ensured that the numerous wholesale traders who used to swarm the markets in the coastal towns absented themselves. “Freshly caught untreated fish have little shelf life and we do not have any modern facility here to prolong the edible nature of the catch. The scores of fish traders who used to come to our towns and the fish landing jetty for purchasing the daily catch are not turning up these days as they are not having adequate cash to disburse to our fishermen. That means our fish catch is getting degraded within the same day and all our efforts are going down the drain with no benefit to us,'' said Fishermen's Association State Secretary Tajuddeen.
Traders who export prawn used to bring large amount of cash as they could not give any bank instrument or transfer money through electronic gadgets to the fishermen. The nature of the fishing activity being what it is, only cash was the feasible option for both who sell and buy fish. Demonetisation put paid to all that since November 9.
A meeting of the fishermen under the aegis of the Association was held on Sunday with Mr. Tajuddeen in the chair. The meeting resolved that considering the current situation when traders are not in a position to come and buy fish, there was no use in venturing into sea for fishing. As such, the fishermen in Thanjavur district have refrained from going to the sea from Monday.
Meanwhile, at the fish markets in Thanjavur East Gate and at the Burma Colony, sales was dull. Since traders can't store fish for more than three days, many sellers were seen dumping the decaying fish.

2016-11-28 08:34:00,Demonetisation takes shirt off the back of textile traders ," The wedding season has brought no cheers to the textile traders in the city. Business activity in the bustling markets of One Town has slowed down as a fallout of the demonetisation even after two long weeks. 
With the temporary cash crunch, the wedding season has turned into a nightmare for traders. It affects close to 50,000 people who are either directly or indirectly dependent on the business in the city as some shopkeepers are already laying off hands.
The wedding season is the time when traders do most of their business but the lack of liquidity has led to problems. The reason: the traders have not yet adopted the modern practice of online payment. Most of the transactions here are done through cash.
A vast majority of the traders in One Town do not have online payment facility, which drives customers away. Despite strong competition from malls, the traders have so far managed to retain and increase their customer base. But, due to the cash crunch, the business has taken a severe beating. 
It is like domino’s effect. The retail sales have plummeted as the customers are starved of currency and are spending the notes available with them only for emergency purposes. “As the retailers don’t have any business, the wholesalers also don’t,” reasons Vastralatha Cloth Merchants’ Association president Ch. Raghuram.
In fact, this is the worst year for the textile traders. There was a little business during the Sravana maasam, a wedding season, due to Krishna Pushkaram. 
The business did not pick up much after the river jamboree. 
The retailers place huge orders in December for Christmas and Sankranti. The festive mood is missing, says another trader.
The One Town is a hub of textile business with the Vastralata Complex and the Krishnaveni Cloth Market drawing retailers and customers across the State. A huge inventory of clothes and textiles arrivesfrom Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and retailers from neighbouring districts too place orders here.
There are about 2,000 textile traders in the city. Of this, 407 shops are in the Vastralata complex alone, and most of them are into wholesale business. And, the nearly same number of shops are there at the Krishnaveni Cloth Market in One Town. The traders don’t disclose the actual volumes of business for obvious reasons.

2016-11-28 00:00:00,RINL hopeful of overcoming demonetisation fallout,"As the impact of demonetisation is seen mostly on secondary and scrap dealers, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, is confident of overcoming the fallout of demonetisation.
As it remained not much hit due to the currency crisis as e-payment is a pre-requisite to buy its products, it hopes that the crisis faced in construction industry will be overcome in the coming months.
The steel industry, as such is hit by global recession and crisis arising out of dumping of cheap steel from China. RINL, a Navratna company, registered a sales turnover of Rs. 600 crore during November 1 to 20 as against total sales of Rs. 860 crore during the same month last year.
The company registered a net loss of Rs.1,421 crore during last fiscal due to market sluggishness and China impact. RINL sales during first half was Rs. 6,520 crore as against Rs. 6,373 crore of last year.
Observers say the current crisis will be over in a month or two and the grounding of mega projects promised by the Central and State governments will generate more demand for steel.
RINL produces long products required for construction of big dams, roads, flyovers and other infrastructure projects. All transactions are done online. Hence, the currency crisis, the officials say, will not have direct bearing on them.
Asked for a specific comment on impact of demonetisation, RINL Chairman-cum-Managing Director P. Madhusudan told The Hindu that “It’s a very good move. It is likely to impact growth in short-term. But some short-term pain for many long-term gains is most welcome.”
There is also a demand by RINL management and trade unions to give preferential treatment to its products for use in the construction of capital at Amaravati.
On the other hand, Steel Exchange India Ltd (SEIL) belonging to Vizag Profiles Group, which produces Simhadri TMT, admits demonetisation has slowed down sales due to standstill in realty business and exudes confidence that the demand will pick up soon.
“It’s a temporary setback due to fear that land prices will crash. But our assessment is that money flow will not be hit and the people will change their opinion,” SEIL Director V.V. Krishna Rao said.",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/RINL-hopeful-of-overcoming-demonetisation-fallout/article16726301.ece,VISAKHAPATNAM
2016-11-28 00:00:00,Commission gangs spring up in city post demonetisation,"Senior police officers feel that commission agents have sprung up all of a sudden across the city to make a fast buck, after the demonetisation was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
They also have concrete information that some bankers are hand-in-glove with the agents and are trying to make the best use of the demonetisation process, by channelising old notes for new ones through multiple accounts.
Already into its third week after the scheme was announced to de-notify Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, sources say the department has placed its teams across the city and have identified a few gangs, but are unable to catch them red-handed.
Describing the modus operandi a senior officer said, “The commission agents are gathering people, especially jobless youth who have legal bank accounts and are asking them to deposit old currency ranging from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2 lakhs, which they get from persons who have black money. And after depositing, they are told to withdraw in phases, as per the limit and then they pay back the person who has given the old notes after deducting a commission varying from 10 to 20 per cent. So if a person given Rs. 2 lakh in old currency, they are paid back Rs. 1.60 lakh in new currency.”
Coming to bankers, the officer said a few employees were under the scanner. The bankers are also grouping in helping them (agents) to deposit into multiple accounts and allowing them to withdraw, and at times are also depositing small amounts into their own accounts, said the officer. The police in the last few days apprehended a few people with huge cash but were unable to act upon, as there is no provision to arrest them, due to lack of a penal code.

Agents identified

According to sources, the city police have identified about 20 such commission agents.
However, an I-T official informed The Hindu , that people depositing somebody’s money into their account would be treated as ‘Benamidar’ which would attract The Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (the Benami Act).",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Commission-gangs-spring-up-in-city-post-demonetisation/article16726281.ece,VISAKHAPATNAM

Mr. Patil said that before coming to power, the BJP had promised to bring the back black money stashed in foreign banks within 100 days of coming to power.
“The BJP has not fulfilled its promise even after over two years in power. Instead, it has demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes which has made lives of the common people miserable.

Stating that over 70 people have died post-demonetisation while standing in queues outside banks and ATMs, Mr. Patil said that the BJP was saying that people have to face some problems for the success of the scheme. “Who will pay for the lives of those who have died?"" the Minister asked. Claiming that the BJP spent over Rs. 1,000 crore in the last General elections towards campaigning, he asked the source of the money and why the BJP was not revealing any details on it if was against black money.

“Gold, property and dollar exchange is being done at much higher prices through wrong channels. Generation of black money in the last 20 days is up by 10 times. Police have caught people with huge amounts in Rs. 2,000 notes. How did they manage to get this money?” Mr. Kejriwal asked. 
He said Mr. Modi was ‘torturing’ and causing grave inconvenience to people and now it had become an ego issue for him. Questioning the purpose behind Mr. Modi’s decision, the Chief Minister said it was done in the name of stopping terrorism, corruption and circulation of counterfeit currency. “Rs. 2,000 notes are found at terrorists’ hideout. Corruption is high and I don’t know where the fake currency producing factories are, India or Pakistan. More fake currency notes are minted in those factories than the RBI is releasing authentic notes in banks and markets,” he said.

Schools, government and private offices and business establishments functioned as usual. Buses, autorickshaws, and private vehicles moved freely.
Meanwhile, members of the Congress took out a rally to protest against demonetisation. They described it as a case of monumental mismanagement that has led to the disruption of the economy.
Leaders, including district Congress committee president Khaji Arshed Ali, Rahim Khan, MLA, KSRTC vice-chairman Basavaraj Bulla, member of the Karnataka State Temperance Board Shantalinga Savalagi, and Irshad Pehelwan walked to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and submitted a memorandum addressed to President Pranab Mukherjee.
They urged the President to direct the Union government to roll back the decision and avoid a Constitutional crisis. India is a cash-based economy, they said, adding that rural areas are completely dependent on cash. The sudden decision to stop circulation of high-value notes has severely affected the lives of the poor, labourers and daily wage earners, especially in the unorganised sector, they rued.
The move has affected the livelihood of street vendors, small merchants, vegetable merchants, hawkers and rickshaw pullers, autorickshaw drivers, craftsmen, farmers, and agriculture labourers. Farming and service sectors and industries have been affected. The functioning of cooperative societies in rural areas too has been hit, they alleged.

Modi’s claim

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim that demonetisation will flush out black money is not based on facts as cash consists of five to six per cent of the black money. The rest is in the form of land, properties, gold, jewellery, shares, and other investments.
There is a growing fear that the huge cash flows in banks after demonetisation would be used only to help banks recover non-performing assets, and not for growth.
The PM’s demand for bearing with the hardships for the next 50-100 days is difficult for the poor to agree to, they added.
Inadequate preparation by the government has led to nearly 100 deaths, they said. The former Prime Minister Manmohan Sing is therefore convinced that demonetisation is a case of “organised loot and legalised plunder”, they said.
Mr. Modi’s claim that 94 per cent of the people welcomed demonetisation is false as nearly four lakh people are said to have lost their jobs, the memorandum stated, adding that the poor and middle classes were suffering owing to demonetisation.
Members of the Welfare Party of India staged a protest in Basavakalyan against demonetisation.
They took out a rally and submitted a memorandum to tahsildar Keerthi. They alleged that the “sudden decision” has affected the livelihood of millions and has resulted in over 100 deaths.

An end to corruption: BJP

The members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) celebrated Sambhram Divas in support of demonetisation. They walked to Ambedkar Circle and raised slogans praising Mr. Modi.
The BJP members also burst crackers and distributed sweets.
They said that the withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would end corruption and remove black money from the economy. Babu Wali, Shakuntala Beldale, Maheshwar Swamy, Chandrashekar Gada, Vijay Kumar Patil, and Dattu Bachepalli were present.

‘Financial Emergency’

Members of the Bahujan Samaj Party too staged a protest against demonetisation.
They walked to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and submitted a memorandum seeking the withdrawal of the decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes and take steps end the sufferings of the people.
They alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared a financial emergency by banning the notes.
“Over 100 people have died. The rich are not affected. This is just an eyewash to cover the failures of the Union government,” they said.

2016-11-29 01:04:00,‘Demonetisation is another tsunami’ ,": Alleging that the demonetisation move had crippled development in all fields in the last 20 days, DMK treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin on Monday said the exercise had actually turned out to be a war by Prime Minister Narendra Modi against 85 per cent of the rural population in the country.
Leading a demonstration in Chennai as part of the nation-wide protests by the opposition parties including the DMK to highlight the hardship caused to people by the recall of Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, Mr. Stalin said while his party supported the efforts to eradicate black money, the government should have addressed the problems created by demonetisation. “We will continue our protests unless the government immediately rectifies the situation,” said Mr. Stalin, who, along with some of the party’s district secretaries, were arrested by the police and released in the evening.
He said November 8, the day on which Prime Minister Modi announced the demonetisation move, was seen by people as yet another tsunami, and normalcy had not returned even after 20 days. “The Centre is just extending the deadlines (for the use of demonetised notes for exempted categories) without making any serious attempt to tide over the crisis,” he charged.
Recalling Mr. Modi’s electoral promise to bring back black money deposited in foreign banks and that every Indian would get Rs. 15 lakh as bank deposit, Mr Stalin wondered whether the Prime Minister was able to deposit at least Rs 15 in their accounts.
He said small traders, farmers, agriculture workers, fishermen and people in the lower rung of the society had been subjected to enormous hardship by the Centre. “The government employees are not spared. That is why we are urging the Centre to pay their salary in cash. The government may say the salary will be credited in their accounts. Can they use cheque to buy vegetables and milk?” he asked.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/%E2%80%98Demonetisation-is-another-tsunami%E2%80%99/article16717728.ece,CHENNAI

The speakers said the demonetisation was enforced without a far-sighted approach and precautionary measures, thus affecting people belonging to middle and lower income groups.
“While the middle class cannot withdraw money from banks to meet emergency needs, farmers, fishermen, weavers and daily wage workers are undergoing untold hardships. Those having Rs. 2,000-notes unable to buy anything as traders refuse to accept it owing to shortage of lower denomination currencies. The Union government, instead of asking the people to bear with this agony for 50 days, should act sensibly to assuage their pains immediately,” Mr. Avudaiappan said.
When the news about the arrest of party treasurer M.K. Stalin in Chennai reached here, they started staging a road roko near Anna Statue and caused a traffic snarl around Tirunelveli Junction. The police immediately arrested the protesters.

2016-11-29 00:00:00,Work apace for biennale despite demonetisation woes,"It was like a bolt from the blue.
The overnight withdrawal of the most circulated currency notes almost threw a spanner in the spadework for the forthcoming edition of the Kochi Muziris Biennale, as the organisers suddenly found themselves not able to pay wages to the 150-odd carpenters, masons, electricians, welders, painters, and other workers contracted to get the venues ready before the contemporary festival of art begins on December 12.
“It dealt a huge blow to all of us — workers, artists, skilled artisans and support staff — who have been working in a time-bound fashion in view of the brief schedule of several artists and technicians in the city in the preparatory phase. Nevertheless, work never came to a complete halt,” said Bose Krishnamachari, president of the Kochi Biennale Foundation (KBF).
Indeed, currency shortage did create a few hiccups initially, but “it is the people [the workers] who have known us over the years, so we managed,” said Biennale chief executive Manju Sara Rajan.
“We have begun to pay those with bank accounts online and asked others to open accounts,” she added.
Even as the venues are getting ready and construction is apace at key venues like Aspinwall House and Cabral Yard where major installations are coming up, shipping of art works from various parts of the world is in progress.
“It is a huge task, also counting that we must return most of these works at the close of the biennale. This, despite the fact that some artists are okay with maintaining their works here, but we do not have a permanent venue.
The State government has, however, promised us all support and may extend help in this regard,” said Mr. Krishnamachari.
The upcoming edition, estimated to have an all-up cost of Rs.27 crore, will see 97 artists from across the world showcasing their works in the main show held across 12 venues.
Besides the regular venues, the main biennale will also have, for the first time, a venue at Kottappuram, in collaboration with the Muziris Heritage Project.
The State government is set to release the first instalment of Rs.7.5 crore it pledged for the coming edition, but the heads of the artists-run biennale toured the country and outside over the past few months to mobilise funds.
“We have received patronage from kind souls and while we are still struggling, we are managing the show. Then there are those who have supported us in kind,” said Mr. Krishnamachari.",Kochi,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/Work-apace-for-biennale-despite-demonetisation-woes/article16743359.ece,Kochi
2016-11-29 20:13:00,Demonetisation hits sheep traders hard," Bala tal gayi (the worst is over), says Sunny Khatik, a sheep trader from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh about how the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has affected his business. 
Inside the sheep/goat market in Ziyaguda, the mood is shifting from deep gloom to sombre reality among the farmers, shepherds, butchers and traders.
“The business was nearly zero for 15 days. Now it is looking up and in another 15 days things will get back to normal,” says Mr. Khatik.
But, not everyone shares the bright picture painted by the man from MP. The sheep market in Ziyaguda is a mini India. Spread over a vast area, it is a daily market with traders from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh coming to buy and sell animals. 
“Everyday we used to trade in two or three truck loads of sheep with each carrying about 250 animals. But now, the business is down and we are managing to sell only one truck load per day. This will have a big effect on farmers as they will have to take care of the animals with nothing in return,” says Ushakiran a wholesale dealer.
“People are no longer serving meat in marriages and I have not had work for the past eight days,” says Narsing, a butcher for hire, who gets Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 per lamb he processes in the Ring Road Crossroad area.
Ironically, the price of meat or animals has not declined due to demonetisation. Hyderabad gets sheep from nearby places like Shadnagar, Mahbubnagar, Sircilla, Kaikoor, etc. 
Due to this currency crisis many of the villagers are not coming to the market with their sheep. There is immense pressure on them to take old currency notes and that is one of the reasons they are keeping away, points out Akbar, who trades in goats in the Toli Masjid area.
A butcher for hire, Ramlal accepts the old currency notes as he doesn’t have a choice and can deposit them into his bank account.
The problem is with big traders, who have stopped using the currency and cut down on purchases affecting the whole market. On Sundays, Ramlal hailing from Langar Houz, used to deal with four or five sheep, but over the past 20 days, he had slaughtered only seven animals. “You can imagine the situation at home,” says Ramlal.",Hyderabad,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Demonetisation-hits-sheep-traders-hard/article16721232.ece,Hyderabad

They said the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes that came into force without any precautionary steps taken to assuage the problems being encountered by traders and the common man had derailed trading completely.
 Though new Rs. 2,000 currency note was released it failed to check the magnitude of the problem.
Situation worsened 
The absence of new 500 rupee note for financial transactions and the non-availability of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes made the situation from bad to worse.
“Moreover, the restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from the current and savings bank account have hit the public, especially the traders. Hence, the Central Government that miserably failed to foresee the impact of demonetisation should expedite the remedial measures,” the speakers at the protest venue stressed.

A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran declined a request made by Assistant Solicitor General G.R. Swaminathan to defer the hearing in both the PIL petitions to next week since the Supreme Court was slated to take up for hearing on December 2 an application preferred by the Centre last week to get transferred to the apex court all cases pending before various High Courts in the country with respect to demonetisation. 
Concern
Pointing out that the application had already been listed for admission on Wednesday, the judges pointed out that the apex court had refused to stay the proceedings before various High Courts. “If what was reported in the newspapers is right, then the Supreme Court had also said that the High Courts are free to decide the cases on their own. Then, why should we adjourn these cases. We are concerned with the money in court custody,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said.
Before posting the case related to demonetised money in court custody for hearing on Wednesday and the PIL petition, filed by ‘Agri’ K.P.T. Ganesan, against Rs.2,000 notes to Friday, the judge said that around Rs.5.8 crore was in the custody of courts in Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Tiruchirappalli and Karur districts.
Of that amount, the courts in Karur district alone had demonetised Rs.500 notes worth Rs.6.4 lakh and Rs.1,000 notes worth Rs.44.09 lakh. 
Proposal
“Come up with some proposal for handling these notes. Reserve Bank of India should say how to go about with the money. We are responsible for returning the money to the owners after the conclusion of trial in criminal cases. It is mostly the money of victims in robbery, theft and other criminal cases.
“Even if we say that we will not return the demonetised notes to the parties, they will have to be compensated. We want to save only legal money in court custody,” the judge told the ASG.

Thirumavalavan alleged that the hidden agenda of demonetisation was to expropriate money from the common man to infuse it into the cash-starved banks, which can later lend them to big corporates.
Addressing a protest meeting here on Monday as part of the nationwide shutdown called by Left parties, he said that demonetisation would not be helpful since black cash was insignificant compared to black wealth held in other forms like foreign currencies, gold and lands.
“Therefore, the idea is to inject all the cash into banks, particularly public-sector banks, which are already reeling under pressure due to non-payment of thousands of crores of loans by big corporates,” he alleged.
He said that if Prime Minister Modi was serious about controlling black money, he should have started with bringing reforms in elections, which he claimed is the breeding ground for corruption and black money.
“However, we cannot expect that from BJP, which spent the maximum money in the last parliamentary election. Is it not the big corporates who funded them?” he questioned.

2016-11-29 00:00:00,HC refuses to adjourn hearing in cases against demonetisation,"The Madras High Court Bench here on Monday refused to adjourn after December 2 the hearing on a public interest litigation petition seeking to declare the newly introduced Rs. 2,000 notes as invalid since they contain Devanagiri numerals and another PIL petition taken by the court suo motu with respect to exempting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in the custody of various courts in the State from the exchange deadline of March 31, 2017.
A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran declined a request made by Assistant Solicitor General G.R. Swaminathan to defer the hearing in both the PIL petitions to next week since the Supreme Court was slated to take up for hearing on December 2 an application preferred by the Centre last week to get transferred to the apex court all cases pending before various High Courts in the country with respect to demonetisation.

Concern

Pointing out that the application had already been listed for admission on Wednesday, the judges pointed out that the apex court had refused to stay the proceedings before various High Courts. “If what was reported in the newspapers is right, then the Supreme Court had also said that the High Courts are free to decide the cases on their own. Then, why should we adjourn these cases. We are concerned with the money in court custody,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said.
Before posting the case related to demonetised money in court custody for hearing on Wednesday and the PIL petition, filed by ‘Agri’ K.P.T. Ganesan, against Rs.2,000 notes to Friday, the judge said that around Rs.5.8 crore was in the custody of courts in Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Tiruchirappalli and Karur districts.
Of that amount, the courts in Karur district alone had demonetised Rs.500 notes worth Rs.6.4 lakh and Rs.1,000 notes worth Rs.44.09 lakh.

Proposal

“Come up with some proposal for handling these notes. Reserve Bank of India should say how to go about with the money. We are responsible for returning the money to the owners after the conclusion of trial in criminal cases. It is mostly the money of victims in robbery, theft and other criminal cases.
“Even if we say that we will not return the demonetised notes to the parties, they will have to be compensated. We want to save only legal money in court custody,” the judge told the ASG.",Madurai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/HC-refuses-to-adjourn-hearing-in-cases-against-demonetisation/article16743135.ece,MADURAI
2016-11-29 19:10:00,RBI data shows reduced cash exchange and bank deposits following demonetisation,"
Banking activities related to demonetisation seems to have slumped in the last ten days. A total of Rs. 2.99 lakh crore was deposited in banks from November 19 to November 27, 40 per cent less compared to Rs. 5.11 lakh crore that was deposited during November 10 to November 19, data from Reserve Bank of India show.
Withdrawal — over the counter or through ATMs — saw a slight increase in the second period, from Rs. 1.03 lakh crore to Rs. 1.13 lakh crore. Overall, Rs. 2.16 lakh crore has been withdrawn from banks from November 10 to 27. As of March 2016, the total value of notes in circulation was Rs. 16.42 lakh crore, of which around Rs. 14 lakh crore (86%) was in form of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes.
“It has been observed that over the counter exchange of the old currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination has shown a declining trend,” the government press release dated November 24 remarked. Data shows the decline was indeed significant. During the period of November 10 to 18, on an average, Rs. 3,667 crore was exchanged over the counter every day. However, from November 19 to November 24 — after which exchange was stopped — the total amount exchanged was just Rs. 942 crores, which means Rs. 157 crores per day, on an average. On November 15, the government decided to use indelible ink to check multiple visits to the cash counter for exchange, which may have led to this drop.

2016-11-29 15:01:00,Demonetisation: Fitch cuts India’s FY17 growth forecast to 6.9 p.c.,"Fitch Ratings on Tuesday lowered India’s GDP growth forecast for this fiscal to 6.9 per cent from 7.4 per cent, saying there will be “temporary disruptions” to economic activity post demonetisation.
It said economic activity will be hit in the October-December quarter because of the cash crunch created by withdrawal and replacement of 500 and 1000 rupee notes that accounted for 86 per cent of the value of currency in circulation.
“Indian growth has also been revised down to reflect temporary disruptions to activity related to the RBI’s surprise demonetisation of large-denomination bank notes,” Fitch said, as it revised real GDP growth forecast down to 6.9 per cent for 2016-17, from 7.4 per cent projected earlier.
The U.S.-based ratings agency also revised the GDP growth forecast for 2017-18 and 2018-19 lower to 7.7 per cent from 8 per cent earlier.
“Gradual implementation of the structural reform agenda is expected to contribute to higher growth, as will higher real disposable income, supported by an almost 24 per cent hike in civil servants’ wages.
“But the anticipated recovery in investment looks a bit less certain in light of ongoing weakness in the data,” Fitch said in its ‘Global Economic Outlook - November’ report.
Regarding currency ban, it said consumers do not have the cash needed to complete purchases, and there have been reports of supply chains being disrupted and farmers unable to buy seeds and fertiliser for the sowing season.
“Time spent queuing in banks is also likely to have affected general productivity. The impact on GDP growth will increase the longer the disruption continues,” Fitch said, adding the medium-term effect of the currency withdrawal on GDP growth is uncertain, but is unlikely to be large.
“Most importantly, demonetisation is a one-off event. People who operate in the informal sector will still be able to use the new high-denomination bills and other options (such as gold) to store their wealth,” it added.
Fitch said there are no new incentives for people to avoid cash transactions and the informal sector could soon go back to business as usual.
Post the demonetisation announcement on November 8, the government and banks have been taking several steps to push digital transactions.
Fitch said it expects RBI’s 1.50 per cent policy rate cuts since the beginning of 2015 to feed through to higher GDP growth, even though monetary transmission has been impaired by relatively weak banking sector health.
“A surge in low-cost funding due to the demonetisation may remove a constraint on banks that prevented lending rates from keeping pace with the RBI’s policy rate cuts in recent years, although this will depend on deposits remaining in banks beyond the next few months,” it said.",Economy,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-Fitch-cuts-India%E2%80%99s-FY17-growth-forecast-to-6.9-p.c./article16720090.ece,New Delhi
2016-11-29 00:00:00,"Demonetisation is another tsunami, says Stalin",": Alleging that the demonetisation move had crippled development in all fields in the last 20 days, DMK treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin on Monday said the exercise had actually turned out to be a war by Prime Minister Narendra Modi against 85 per cent of the rural population in the country.
Leading a demonstration in Chennai as part of the nation-wide protests by the opposition parties including the DMK to highlight the hardship caused to people by the recall of Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, Mr. Stalin said while his party supported the efforts to eradicate black money, the government should have addressed the problems created by demonetisation. “We will continue our protests unless the government immediately rectifies the situation,” said Mr. Stalin, who, along with some of the party’s district secretaries, were arrested by the police and released in the evening.
He said November 8, the day on which Prime Minister Modi announced the demonetisation move, was seen by people as yet another tsunami, and normalcy had not returned even after 20 days. “The Centre is just extending the deadlines (for the use of demonetised notes for exempted categories) without making any serious attempt to tide over the crisis,” he charged.
Recalling Mr. Modi’s electoral promise to bring back black money deposited in foreign banks and that every Indian would get Rs. 15 lakh as bank deposit, Mr Stalin wondered whether the Prime Minister was able to deposit at least Rs 15 in their accounts.
He said small traders, farmers, agriculture workers, fishermen and people in the lower rung of the society had been subjected to enormous hardship by the Centre.
“The government employees are not spared. That is why we are urging the Centre to pay their salary in cash. The government may say the salary will be credited in their accounts. Can they use cheque to buy vegetables and milk?” he asked.
Later talking to reporters, he said even though there were reports that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was responding well to treatment and she was able to talk and walk, she had not explained her stand on demonetisation. “There is a doubt whether the media reports are correct or not,” he said.
Mr. Stalin added that it was unfortunate that Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam, who is holding the portfolios of the Chief Minister, also had not explained the State government’s stand on the issue.

2016-11-29 00:00:00,Chit funds business too hit by demonetisation,"Faced with cash crunch due to demonetisation, chit funds fear payment default if the situation does not improve.
Chit fund is a financial tool that allows people to save and borrow at the same time. A few members come together and decide on making a monthly contribution each month and would then be entitled to take a lump sum on a pre-determined auction date. Some chit funds are registered, but most of them operate informally in neighbourhoods and unofficially among office colleagues, making it one of the riskiest financial institution.
“Main users of chit funds are daily wage earners, salaried individuals, housewives and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). The proceeds are used by households for consumption purposes like marriage, buying property and other unforeseen emergencies,” T S Sivaramakrishnan, general secretary of All India Association of Chit Funds (AIACF), said. Consumers pay their monthly instalments in cash, and MSMEs, which also deal in cash, account for 20 per cent of business, but 80 per cent of value for most chit funds.
Sivaramakrishnan, who is the director of Balussery Benefit Chit Fund, said such customers are facing inconvenience and finding it difficult to pay monthly instalments. “It would be difficult to honour the payout commitments to subscribers because our cash flow gets affected. And the main pinch would be felt during the start of next month when payments become due.”
Manoj Padmanaban, CEO, The Mayavaram Financial Chit Corporation, which runs Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 50 lakh chits, said cash crunch would continue for the next three months and MSMEs would be the most hit because they do cash transactions. In the long-term, the move would help registered chit funds, as it would weed out unregistered operators.
Sivaramakrishnan said his firm is looking at POS options and was also in talks with players like Paytm to enable electronic payments of monthly subscriptions. The problem with POS is the two per cent charge, which is difficult to foot when registered chit funds are operating at five per cent commission.


The main subscribers are daily wage earners, salaried individuals, housewives, MSMEs

The Congress held a bike rally from Shahibaug to Lal Darwaza with its Leader of the Opposition Shankersinh Vaghela, State unit president Bharatsinh Solanki, and party MLAs addressing a gathering. Mr. Vaghela said the common man is struggling to withdraw their hard-earned money. 
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done this [demonetisation] keeping in mind the upcoming State assembly elections. But the [Central] government should keep the interest of the public before that of the party. Only this BJP government can create a system where the police will beat you up for struggling to withdraw your own money.” 
Accusing Mr. Modi of following the Hitler mode of functioning, Mr. Solanki claimed the Prime Minister will give money deposited by the public to industrialists whose loan defaults run into lakhs of crores of rupees. The Congress also held rallies at Banaskantha where party workers handed over a memorandum to the Collector.
A group of farmers blocked a State highway, halting traffic for hours before the police dispersed them. Markets in the tribal town of Naswadi in Chhota Udepur district remained closed.
The NCP staged a protest near the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) building. The police detained around 70 workers, including 15 women, saying they did not have the police permission to hold the rally.
However, senior NCP leader Praful Patel and Gujarat NCP president Jayant Patel were allowed to go inside the RBI building to make a representation to the officials. 
Mr. Praful Patel alleged that the BJP-led government and the RBI have failed miserably to address the issue of cash crunch. “We are with the government on this fight against black money. But our contention is that people are facing hardship even 20 days after the demonetisation. Neither the government nor the RBI has any roadmap to deal with the problem.” 
Dubbing the BJP-led Central government as anti-poor, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Ashok Chavan in Mumbai on Monday said his party will raise the demonetisation issue in Parliament and the State legislature.
The winter session of Maharashtra Legislature begins in Nagpur from December 5.
Mr. Chavan alleged that the government had waived Vijay Mallya’s loan but not that of farmers. “The BJP government at the Centre is anti-poor. Nine farmers have committed suicide recently; still the government has no shame.”
Mr. Chavan said the citizens, who deposited their money in bank accounts, are not able to withdraw it. Small traders, farmers, labourers, and working class have been the worst-hit. Rural economy has virtually collapsed, he said. ",Mumbai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Cong.-NCP-hold-rallies-to-protest-demonetisation/article16717277.ece,

2016-11-30 00:37:00,Demonetisation hits Maoists ," When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation scheme on November 8, he gave many reasons on why the higher denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 ceased to be legal tenders. And primary among them was to hit the black money market and the extremist organisations such as the Maoists. 
While it is still to ascertain how much black money has come under the tax fold, but there are clear indications that demonetisation has hit the Maoists hard. 
Top sources in the police say that the Maoists located in the jungles of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra-Odisha-Border (AOB) areas are desperate to get the crores of rupees that are stashed in the dumps exchanged for the new currency.
Visakhapatnam (Range) DIG Ch. Srikanth informed The Hindu that the Maoists are desperately trying to rope in contractors and ganja smugglers to get the old notes exchanged. 
While a few cases were detected in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, so far no case has been detected on the Andhra side. “A few contractors were taken into custody in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, when they tried to exchange the old notes and some gold belonging to the Maoists. Recently, a man was taken into custody in Kondagaon, a municipality in Chhattisgarh, when he was moving suspiciously near a bank with some unaccounted cash of about ₹ 44 lakh, in old currency of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 in denominations, and some gold coins worth about ₹ 2 lakh. On interrogation he disclosed that the Maoists had given them for exchange,” said a senior officer from the APSIB, who looks after counter-insurgency in the Andhra-Odisha-Border region. According to the officer, the actual wealth or cash reserve of the Maoists is not clearly known but a report from Chhattisgarh intelligence suggest that they (Maosits) have about ₹ 6,000 to ₹ 6,500 crore in cash and gold stashed in dumps in the ‘red corridor’ area in Chhattisgarh alone. 
Mr. Srikanth pointed out that the rough estimated annual income of the Maoists in the AOB region could range between ₹ 300 to ₹ 400 crore. 
“Till about five to seven year ago it was about ₹ 120 to ₹ 150 crore, but with the ganja smuggling taking the centre-stage and Maoists having a cut in it, it is estimated that income could have crossed ₹ 300 crore,” he said.
Basically, the income of the Left Wing Extremists (LWE) is through extortion from the contractors and cut from the ganja smugglers. “Extortion is the main source,” said Narsipatnam OSD A. Babujee.
Stashing
Till about a few years ago, the Left Wing Extremists were stashing the cash collected in dumps located at safe places. In earlier raids at the dumps, the police have found cash ranging from ₹ 4 to ₹ 7 lakh along with arms and literature, a number of times. But off late, due to various factors such as the notes getting spoilt over a period of time, the Maoists have shifted their strategy and were converting the cash into gold coins. 
A contractor was caught at Ralagedda in Visakhapatnam agency in 2015 and the police recovered about 2 kg of gold coins from him.
Strict vigil
Strict vigil at the banks and an eye over the contractors and habitual ganja offenders in the region by the AP police is forcing the Maoists to move the cash to safer places in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. 
And it is increasingly becoming difficult in those States also with every passing day and that has created a desperate situation for the Left Wing Extremists, said Mr. Babujee. 
Police have nexus with smugglers: Maoists
Meanwhile, the spokesperson of the banned CPI (Maoist) released a letter accusing the police of having a nexus with the ganja smugglers.
The letter was released in the name of one Kailasam, secretary of the East Division Committee of the banned outfit, here on Tuesday.
In the letter, the Maoist leader decried the efforts made by the police to tarnish the revolutionary image of the Left Wing Extremists by calling them supporters of ganja smugglers and accusing them (Maoists) of having a cut in the smuggling activity. As per the letter, all senior police officers in the district in turn have an understanding with the smugglers and are recipients of huge kickbacks.",Andhra Pradesh,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-hits-Maoists/article16727003.ece,VISAKHAPATNAM

Replying to a query by Yasin Haveripeth, councillor, at the general body meeting here on Wednesday, Mr. Hiremath said that before demonetisation, only 40 per cent of the tax collection target had been met. As tax payers were allowed to use old currency, there had been a hike in collection. A sum of Rs 8.18 crore had been collected as property tax; Rs. 1.6 crore as stallage fee; Rs. 70 lakh as property tax through cheque; and Rs. 2.3 crore as water cess in Hubballi and Rs. 1.4 crore in Dharwad. “Now, the HDMC has extended the period of paying taxes through old Rs. 500 notes till December 15 and the amount is likely to go up,” he said. 
Nearly 40 per cent of shopkeepers had not paid their taxes and now 150 were visiting the HDMC to pay their pending taxes in instalments. The remaining defaulters had been told to pay by December 15. “The HDMC had set a target to collect Rs. 9 crore as stallage fee, of which Rs. 3 crore had been collected so far and the remaining is expected to be collected in a fortnight,” he said.
Members of all political parties condemned HDMC officials for not carrying out works on filling potholes. Lower cadre officials had not been cooperating with senior officials and directions from the commissioner had not been implemented, they said.
The meeting also decided to waive the interest charged on pending water bills to help the poor. Member Deepak Chinchore said that he had spoken to the Chief Minister and the government was ready to pay the amount. Mr. Hiremath said the HDMC would waive the interest levied on pending water bills and the people might now pay only the water cess.",Karnataka,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/HDMC-collects-Rs.-16-cr.-as-tax-after-demonetisation/article16731723.ece,DHARWAD

In Kizhakkambalam, the thieves struck the home of a businessman and stole around 57 sovereigns of gold and Rs.1 lakh as cash, kept in the form of old currencies. “May be they are hoping to get the old notes exchanged from banks over a period of time,” a top officer with the Ernakulam Rural police said.
Meanwhile, the police are now examining whether the currency notes stolen from an apartment in Ernakulam North belonged to the demonetised category. As per a complaint, burglars broke into the apartment, owned by a Rajasthan native, and decamped with 1.75 kilograms of gold, in addition to cash worth Rs.3.5 lakh.
After a much-hyped beginning, the functioning of the special squad constituted to check organised criminal activities in Kochi appears to have hit a roadblock.
While Zakir Husain, a CPI(M) leader accused in a kidnap case, surrendered after 22 days, the police failed to trace three others - Sheela Thomas, Antony Ashamparambil and Jilson Peter - accused in two separate cases.
“The police have no other option but to wait as they have been moving from court to court, seeking anticipatory bail,” said a top official with the Kochi city police.
It’s been nearly a month since the police booked these individuals, in two separate cases of kidnap and threatening. Though several persons were arrested in connection with the case, they are still at large and the police are unable to trace them.
Officials in the lower rung are of the view that the police should not have waited this long to arrest them. “It seems the police are afraid of their political clout,” they said.

2016-11-30 00:00:00,Demonetisation work: call to compensate bank staff,"The government and the Indian Banks Association should pass necessary orders to various bank managements to pay statutory compensation to their employees for the overtime work they had done during the post-demonetisation period, Syndicate Bank Staff Association (SBSA) vice-president K.S. Bhatt has said.
Mr. Bhatt told The Hindu here on Tuesday that bank
employees across the country were happy that Prime
Minister Narendra Modi had acknowledged their dedicated service during the post-demonetisation days.

‘Educate people’

The SBSA leader called upon the bank employees to reject any kind of agitation against demonetisation and enlighten the common man about its merits.
It was unfortunate that certain union leaders appeared to be against bringing in any sort of control on cooperative banks, Mr. Bhatt alleged.
He said it was not correct to state that demonetisation had not
affected most businessmen as they used the overdraft facility to launder black money. “Any remittance over Rs.50,000 invariably requires the Permanent Account Number, lest the system will not accept it, and hence such arguments are baseless and politically motivated,’’ he added.
Mr. Bhatt alleged that certain trade unions were trying to misguide the employees as well as the public through such baseless statements.
Their arguments that the demonetisation should have been declared with adequate arrangements and also that the Reserve Bank of India had failed to print enough Rs.100 and Rs.500 denomination notes were aimed at furthering their political agenda, he said.",Kerala,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Demonetisation-work-call-to-compensate-bank-staff/article16743769.ece,PATHANAMTHITTA
2016-11-30 18:40:00,Amartya Sen terms demonetisation a despotic action ,"Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen has called the Narendra Modi government’s demonetisation move “despotic action that has struck at the root of economy based on trust.”
“It (demonetisation) undermines notes, it undermines bank accounts, it undermines the entire economy of trust. That is the sense in which it is despotic,” Prof. Sen told to a TV channel.
He further said his immediate point of view on demonetisation is on its economic aspect.
“It’s (demonetisation) a disaster on economy of trust. In the last 20 years, the country has been growing very fast. But it is all based on acceptance of each other’s word. By taking despotic action and saying we had promised but won’t fulfil our promise, you hit at the root of this,” Prof. Sen said.
Noting that capitalism has many successes that have come from having trust in businesses, he said if a government promises in promissory notes and breaks such promise, then it is a despotic act.
“I am not a great admirer of capitalism. On the other hand, capitalism has many successes... It’s despotic in the sense that if a government promises in promissory note that when given, we will give you this amount of compensation for it and to break such a promise is a despotic action,” Sen, who is currently Thomas W Lamont University Professor at Harvard University, said.
The demonetisation issue has also rocked Parliament as both Houses have been witnessing disruptions and adjournments due to noisy protests by Opposition parties for the past several days.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Amartya-Sen-terms-demonetisation-a-despotic-action/article16730675.ece,New Delhi 
2016-11-30 00:00:00,Deposits rise even before demonetisation,"Deposits in commercial banks in the district have shown an increase of nearly 10 per cent during the current fiscal even before demonetisation announced.
The credit off take in priority sectors too showed an increase, exceeding the Annual Credit Plan target during the first half of the current financial year.
The official statistics obtained by The Hindu shows that deposits in the banks stood at Rs. 14,911.11 crore at the end of the first half of the current fiscal – September 30 – as against Rs. 13,637 crore on March 31, 2016.
Lead District Manager S. Sundaramoorthy attributes the increase in the deposits to the rising faith of people in banks as a safe destination to keep their savings.
“The confidence levels have gone up primarily because of various cheating incidents reported in the district. Many have been duped by certain institutions after collecting deposits offering attractive interest rates,” he said.
The credit flow to priority sectors like agriculture and MSMEs has shown an increase too.
The total disbursement during the first half of the current financial year was of Rs. 4,465 crore against a target of Rs. 4,383 crore.
Despite a weak monsoon, the loan disbursement to agriculture sector stood at 103 per cent of the target.
Bank officials say that the loans were taken to sink more borewells, replace the old water distribution pipelines, and for preparation of land for rabi sowing.
The credit flow to MSME sector stood at 101 per cent during first half of the fiscal.
“Currency was reasonably fairing well and also government gave rebate on State levies like Value Added Tax to the tune of 3.2 per cent, which enthused garment manufacturers to take loans to execute more orders,” said S.

2016-11-30 00:00:00,Traders stage demonstration against demonetisation,"Condemning the Union Government for failing to take precautionary measures before demonetising the high value currency notes, members of ‘Confederation of Tamil Nadu Traders’ Associations’ staged a demonstration here on Tuesday.
They said the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes that came into force without any precautionary steps taken to assuage the problems being encountered by traders and the common man had derailed trading completely.
Though new Rs. 2,000 currency note was released it failed to check the magnitude of the problem.

Situation worsened

The absence of new 500 rupee note for financial transactions and the non-availability of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes made the situation from bad to worse.
“Moreover, the restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from the current and savings bank account have hit the public, especially the traders. Hence, the Central Government that miserably failed to foresee the impact of demonetisation should expedite the remedial measures,” the speakers at the protest venue stressed.
Tirunelveli Regional Chairman of the Confederation M.R. Subramanian presided over the agitation in which office-bearers K. Murugesan, M.R. Gunasekaran, R.P.K. Selvakumar, M. Panneerselvam, and G.

‘Extend deadline’

The traders demanded the Centre to take steps for the provision of Rs. 500 currency, along with Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denomination notes in adequate number to the trading community through banks, and for extending the deadline for exchanging the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes in the banks and post offices till March 31, 2017. The protesting traders also demanded provision of swiping machines to all the registered trading houses through banks immediately.
S. K. Periasamy, district president of the Peramaippu, led the agitation.

2016-11-30 07:48:00,‘Demonetisation will end UPA’s asset inflation-driven growth’ ,"Blaming the two UPA governments for using asset inflation as the driver of growth, economic and political commentator S. Gurumurthy on Tuesday said that demonetisation was a planned contraction that would make real growth possible.
Mr. Gurumurthy, who is also the Distinguished Research Professor of Legal Anthropology at SASTRA University, was delivering the 13th Nani Palkhivala Memorial Lecture, organised by the School of Law at the University.
“Without breaking the hold of asset inflation and wealth-influenced jobless growth, there is no real growth possible,” he said. His analysis was founded on the premise that under the then Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, the gains made during the NDA regime of 1999-2004 was lost. “It is a very important point that, the background for this analysis has to start from the movement of the Indian economy from 1999 – how it took an elitist turn based on the experiences of countries like America. Because of that, we destabilised our own economy,” he said.
Mr. Gurumurthy called 1999-2004 the ‘Golden Era of the Indian Economy’. He said that 60 million jobs had been created during those five years, as opposed to 27 lakh jobs in the next six years. 
“It happened because of the huge surge of unmonitored cash in the economy which propelled gold prices, which rose 316 times,” he said.
The price of property also rose and the stock market went up four times. “Participatory notes pushed up the stock market, cash pushed up gold and cash pushed up property. This is known as asset inflation, which leads to wealth effect. This wealth effect is what is reflected in the high growth of GDP,” he said, adding that banknotes of the Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denominations constituted 34 per cent of the cash supply in 2004, but rose to 87 per cent later. An RBI study had shown that two-thirds of all Rs. 1,000 and one-thirds of all Rs. 500 banknotes were not in circulation: “Money, instead of a flow, had become store value.”
Piketty effect
Mr. Gurumurthy cited the work of French economist Thomas Piketty to say that the economic growth during 2004-2014 did not improve the lives of the poor. 
“This has nothing to do with economic activities which will benefit people less than the higher 10 or 15 per cent of the population. This is known as the Piketty effect...this has nothing to do with the ordinary people. What was happening legally in Europe was happening illegally through the huge cash surge in the Indian economy,” he said.
Among the benefits will be a fall in the price of land, which will enable a growth in the housing sector. “Never in the history of economics, a contraction like this has been deliberately planned...They (economists) say that crisis is inevitable; you ask any economist, he will say, ‘Crisis is correction’. You can’t correct ahead of the correction?...Narendra Modi preponed the crisis to handle it,” he contended.
He had harsh words for economists who have raised concerns about the policy. “If [former United States Secretary of Treasury] Larry Summers writes about India, he is completely illiterate...He doesn’t know how mandis operate. He doesn’t know how Koyambedu [wholesale market] operates. We operate on an entirely different grammar,” said Mr. Gurumurthy.
He, however, warned that the government should move to help small- and medium-scale enterprises. “The most important challenge which the Modi government will face is how to finance the small and medium enterprises, a large number of which were being financed by cash,” he said.
S. Mahalingam, former chief financial officer at Tata Consultancy Services and non-executive chairman of City Union Bank, moderated the discussion.

Addressing students of Woxsen School of Business at its campus in Munipally mandal on Tuesday evening, head of the global business conglomerate said: “For many politicians, money power is the lifeline. Cash is king in Indian politics.”
“Payments to workers, wages for people to attend political rallies/meetings, distribution of gifts to lure voters, feeding them are part of that. Candidates and or parties use money collected from undisclosed sources. Nearly three-quarters of incomes of political parties is collected from undisclosed sources,” he explained.
Demonetisation could be the death knell for political parties and politicians. Prime Minister Modi is the new disrupter in Indian politics, he said. 
“Disruptions have happened in so many fields, but, this is the first time we will witness disruption in politics,” the former MP said, according to a release here on Wednesday.
Mr. Dalmia said decision to demonetise old Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes will radically alter the political landscape. It has the potential of cleaning up the monetary system of the country, he added.

The play staged in front of the regional office of the Reserve Bank of India at Kaloor in protest against demonetisation on Tuesday evening drew crowds. It brought alive the 14th century ruler from the pages of history as he sets out to gather information about demonetisation.

2016-11-30 01:10:00,‘Realty unaffected by demonetisation’," Despite the fall in the number of land registrations post demonetisation, city realtors representing CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India) claimed that the sector remains unaffected following the ban on higher currency notes. 
According to CREDAI members, 95 per cent of the Hyderabad market consists of mid segment housing and the buyers are mostly employees who avail property loans. 
Since there is no cash component in the transaction, the demonetisation has no effect on prices of residential housing, they said.
The members also said that most of the credible builders are taking loans from banks and also entering in to joint agreements with plot-owners leaving no scope for the use of cash in the construction projects.
S Ram Reddy, President, CREDAI Hyderabad said the demonetisation will benefit the sector as housing loans can get slashed from existing 9 per cent to 6.5 to 7 per cent due to the huge inflows to the banks.
“The much awaited RERA (Real Estate Regulation Act) bill will come into force from May 2017 and there is going to be short supply of housing stock in the market and as a consequence of this shortage, the real estate prices will go up.
 Also, the effect of a GST coming into effect from April 2017 is that the prices would increase on account of non-availability of a service tax set off as well as increase in the rate of tax rate,” Mr. Reddy said.
He predicted that the property prices might increase by 10 to 12 per cent after the implementation of RERA and GST and advised people to buy property soon.
P Ramakrishna Rao, General Secretary, CREDAI Hyderabad said that the usage of cash will become minimal during transaction in purchase of open plots and second hand homes due to demonetisation.

A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran declined a request made by Assistant Solicitor General G.R. Swaminathan to defer the hearing in both the PIL petitions to next week since the Supreme Court was slated to take up for hearing on December 2 an application preferred by the Centre last week to get transferred to the apex court all cases pending before various High Courts in the country with respect to demonetisation.
Pointing out that the application had already been listed for admission on Wednesday, the judges pointed out that the apex court had refused to stay the proceedings before various High Courts. “If what was reported in the newspapers is right, then the Supreme Court had also said that the High Courts are free to decide the cases on their own. Then, why should we adjourn these cases. We are concerned with the money in court custody,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said.
Before posting the case related to demonetised money in court custody for hearing on Wednesday and the PIL petition, filed by ‘Agri’ K.P.T. Ganesan, against Rs.2,000 notes to Friday, the judge said that around Rs.5.8 crore was in the custody of courts in Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Tiruchirappalli and Karur districts.
Of that amount, the courts in Karur district alone had demonetised Rs.500 notes worth Rs.6.4 lakh and Rs.1,000 notes worth Rs.44.09 lakh.
“Come up with some proposal for handling these notes. Reserve Bank of India should say how to go about with the money. We are responsible for returning the money to the owners after the conclusion of trial in criminal cases. It is mostly the money of victims in robbery, theft and other criminal cases.

2016-11-30 22:23:00,Fools link BJP’s victory to demonetisation: Sena,"MUMBAI: Taking a dig at Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who linked the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) impressive performance in the first round of civic polls in Maharashtra to demonetisation, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday said those who link the victory to demonetisation are fools.
“Those who say that people have voted the BJP to power due to the decision of demonetisation are fools. If that was the case, at least 100 candidates from that party would have been elected as council chief, which did not happen,” said an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna.
The Sena, which shares power with the BJP in the State and at the Centre, took a swipe at the BJP for having its campaign spearheaded by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, saying, in contrast, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray or any of the party leaders did not engage in the poll campaign.
“We wanted to instill confidence into our workers that they can fight the money-based campaign, which we succeeded. Our win assumes significance as we, in a bid to get the required numbers, did not engage in any unholy alliance,” it said, adding this makes the party’s win pure. “We did not adopt the approach of dampening the morale of our party workers by allying with parties against whom we levelled charges of corruptions.” 
Had the Sena entered into backdoor alliances with parties like the Congress, NCP, and the AIMIM, it too could have got more, the editorial said.
The BJP emerged as the largest party in the first leg of the poll with 893 councillors, followed by the Congress, NCP, and the Sena, who won 727, 615 and 529 seats.",Mumbai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Fools-link-BJP%E2%80%99s-victory-to-demonetisation-Sena/article16731601.ece,

2016-11-30 00:00:00,Demonetisation hits Maoists hard,"When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of high-value notes on November 8, he gave many reasons for it. And primary among them was to target the black money market and extremist organisations.
While it is still to be ascertained how much black money has come under the tax fold, there are clear indications that the Maoists are hard hit. Top sources in the police department say that the Maoists located in Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) areas are desperate to exchange the crores of rupees stashed in dumps for new currency. Visakhapatnam range DIG Ch. Srikanth told The Hindu that the Maoists were desperately trying to rope in contractors and ganja smugglers to get the old notes exchanged. While a few cases were detected in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, so far no case was detected on the Andhra side.
“A few contractors were taken into custody in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, when they tried to exchange old notes and some gold belonging to the Maoists. Recently, a man was taken into custody in Kondagaon, a municipality in Chhattisgarh, when he was moving suspiciously near a bank with some unaccounted cash of about Rs. 44 lakh, in old currency of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 in denominations, and some gold coins worth about Rs. 2 lakh. On interrogation he disclosed that the Maoists had given them for exchange,” said a senior officer from the APSIB, who looks after counter-insurgency in the AOB region.
According to the officer, the actual wealth or cash reserve of the Maoists is not clearly known, but a report from Chhattisgarh intelligence suggests that they have about Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 6,500 crore in cash and gold stashed in dumps in the ‘red corridor’ area in Chhattisgarh alone. Mr. Srikanth pointed out that the rough estimated annual income of the Maoists in the AOB region could range between Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 crore.
“Till about five to seven years ago it was about Rs. 120 to Rs. 150 crore, but with ganja smuggling taking centre-stage and Maoists having a cut in it, it is estimated that the income could have crossed Rs. 300 crore,” he said.
Basically, the income of the Left Wing Extremists (LWE) is through extortion from the contractors and cut from the ganja smugglers. “Extortion is the main source,” said Narsipatnam OSD A. Babujee.
Strict vigil at the banks and an eye over the contractors and habitual ganja offenders in the region by the AP police is forcing the Maoists to move cash to safer places in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. And it is increasingly becoming difficult in those States also, said Mr. Babujee.

Police have nexus with smugglers: Maoists

Meanwhile, the spokesperson of the Maoists released a letter accusing the police of having a nexus with ganja smugglers. The letter was released in the name of Kailasam, secretary of the East Division Committee of the banned outfit, here on Tuesday.

2016-12-01 19:41:00,U.S. backs India’s demonetisation drive," The United States on Wednesday described India’s demonetisation drive as an “important and necessary” step to curb illicit cash and actions. “…this was, we believe, an important and necessary step to crack down on illegal actions,” Mark Toner, State Department spokesperson, said in response to a question. 
Mr. Toner said the demonetisation exercise “followed on a series of steps that the Modi government took over the past two years to reduce black market money.” 
“I think it also included a four-month amnesty for tax evaders in India, which resulted in...the disclosure or declaration of billions of dollars in hidden assets. This was an action – I’m talking about the discontinuance of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes – designed to target illicit cash proceeds from corruption and tax dodging,” he said. 
‘Inconvenient but necessary’
Acknowledging that the move inconvenienced people, Mr. Toner said it was “a necessary one to address the corruption.” 
“As it was an inconvenience for many Indians, it was an inconvenience for Americans who were also there …. American citizens, who are working and living in India, I think have the proper information now to exchange those notes or to get new notes, and it’s a little bit of an adjustment, just as it was an inconvenience, I’m sure, for many Indians,” he said.",International,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/U.S.-backs-India%E2%80%99s-demonetisation-drive/article16737394.ece,WASHINGTON
2016-12-01 01:20:00,Noted American experts divided over India’s demonetisation drive,"Two prominent American economists have widely different views on India’s demonetisation drive. Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff is of the opinion that the move will help tackle corruption and tax evasion, while Pranab Bardhan, Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, believes it cannot make “much of a dent in the long-term problem of corruption or black money.” Both of them shared their views with The Hindu through emails on Monday.   
“There is little precedent in peacetime for India’s overnight demonetisation of its two largest banknotes.  The basic idea of taking old notes out of circulation and introducing new ones is perfectly normal and sensible, but usually this is done gradually over a period of years (per the plan I propose for advanced economies in my recent book The Curse of Cash). India’s approach of forcing a rapid exchange may well succeed in penalising corrupt politicians, criminal and tax evaders far more than a gradual approach would.  But even if the move had been well prepared, the collateral damage on ordinary people would still have been significant.  The long-run effects of India’s currency exchange on corruption, crime and tax evasion may yet prove so great they will still outweigh the short-run costs but that will depend on implementation,” said Mr. Rogoff.
The Curse of Cash argues for eliminating large notes and not replacing them, which Mr. Rogoff said in a recent blog, “is not aimed at developing countries, where the share of people without effective access to banking is just too large.” But he has been largely supportive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move:  “Indeed, developing countries share some of the same problems and the corruption and counterfeiting problem is often worse. Simply replacing old notes with new ones does have a lot of beneficial effects similar to eliminating large notes. Anyone turning in large amounts of cash still becomes very vulnerable to legal and tax authorities. Indeed that is Modi’s idea. And criminals have to worry that if the government has done this once, it can do it again, making large notes less desirable and less liquid.”
Mr. Bardhan does not agree with this view. “Most business people do not keep their black income under a mattress. They keep it in the form of gold, real estate, commodity stocks, and offshore accounts. Of course, they keep some amount in cash for various current transaction needs, but I doubt it's more than a very tiny percentage of total black money,” he said. “Apart from the tremendous hardship that the poor people are going through, the large informal sector in the economy will find it very difficult and time-consuming to recover from this big blow. Those who think the shrinkage of the informal sector is a good thing, do not realise that this will not suddenly push the informal sector to start using credit card or mobile wallets, or that there are not many formal sector jobs waiting for those who lose their livelihood in the informal sector. The bungling and mismanagement in the implementation of this highly intrusive and disruptive policy so far suggests ""maximum government, minimum governance"" exactly the opposite of what the Prime Minister had promised in 2014. He and his loyal Finance Minister keep on advising poor people to go digital (""eat cake"").”
Mr. Bardhan said, real estate prices will take a hit temporarily, but “when the new notes come, real estate markets will go back to normal, unless some other drastic measures are taken.” “Politicians who had taken out cash to fund the forthcoming elections, say in UP, will get hit. BJP, of course, has the advantage of incumbency over other parties to get funds from its crony capitalists. In any case, things again will go back to normal, after the new notes are in circulation. The first step to curb undocumented election finance is to have regular mandatory and independent auditing of party funds, which no political party (including BJP) has accepted.”
“…this is an awful way of doing it,” Mr. Bardhan said on the objective of curbing counterfeit notes. “Other countries (for example, the US facing the largest amount of counterfeit dollars in the world) do it in stages and quietly.” “Some economists hope that the government will have a windfall revenue gain from the unreturned cash, but this is likely to be cancelled by the diminished revenue prospects from a much slower-growing economy as a result of this policy. In the end this may turn out to be another of Modi's stunts to distract the electorate from his disappointing performance,” said Mr. Bardhan.",International,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Noted-American-experts-divided-over-India%E2%80%99s-demonetisation-drive/article16733142.ece,Washington

“By doing this, our Prime Minister has given the strongest possible push to the growth of a digitally-enabled, optimal-cash economy in India. This decision is an important step in his ongoing efforts to change the mindset of the people of India. Digitally-enabling transactions will help to create a fair, just, transparent and strong India and Indian economy. It will bring unprecedented accountability at every level. I believe that the common people will be the biggest beneficiaries of this change,” said Mr. Ambani.
Mr. Ambani believes that every Indian will have a digital ATM in their hands.
“No more will they have to travel and stand in queue for train tickets, bus tickets, and movie tickets, to pay bills for utilities, or to deposit and withdraw money from banks. Time saved is money earned. Therefore, I am absolutely confident that a digitally-enabled economy will help India become stronger — and every Indian becomes even stronger,” said Mr. Ambani.
Congratulating the Prime Minister for this historic decision, Mr. Ambani said, “With one single step, he has brought all the unproductive money into productive use. This will enhance credit flow in the economy and legitimate credit is the fuel that powers the engine of economic growth. This will provide credit to our farmers, small shopkeepers, traders and daily wage earners. Again, the biggest benefit of this goes to the ordinary Indian.”

Dheenadayalan, working partner of the company, said that the group’s business was largely based on cash transactions. “Traders found it difficult to take delivery of consignment from us due to the shortage of lower denomination currencies,” he said. Orders have also dried up as retail traders had been making only cash payments.
G. Ajithan, one of the founders and advisor, who explained the advantages of primary value addition in agricultural produce, said that 300 kg of fruit is dried every day which is reduced to 25 per cent of its weight at the end of the day.

2016-12-01 23:45:00,Alia-SRK escape demonetisation curse,"Barely a few days after the tragic November 2008 bomb blasts that held Mumbai hostage, Shah Rukh Khan’s Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi released. The film successfully managed to get people out of their homes to congregate in public spaces, which at the time were the least preferred destination for most. At the end of its theatrical run, the film — made on a budget of Rs. 22 crore — amassed a staggering Rs. 84.68 crore net at the box office (according to boxofficeindia.com). The success was credited to Khan and his star power’s hold over the country. Another film, released around the same time, didn’t do so well. “Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! got outstanding reviews, but people didn’t go see the film in theatres,” says Vajir Singh, editor at Box Office India.
Eight years later, it seems Khan has managed a similar feat with Dear Zindagi. Thankfully, the threat of terror is not looming over the country this time, but the recent demonetisation has led to a critical cash crunch. It’s severely affected the way people spend their money and cinema figures far, far down the priority list. Since its release, Gauri Shinde’s sophomore effort has earned Rs. 44.7 crore net domestic (Ormax Media) on its sixth day, surpassing her debut English Vinglish (2012), which made approximately Rs. 40 crore (boxofficeindia.com) in its entire lifetime in cinema halls.
So far, Dear Zindagi’s run has been hailed as fulfilling by all. Some experts have praised Bhatt’s extraordinary performance, others attribute the success to Shinde’s story. And yet, there are those who insist it’s all because of Khan. Perhaps it’s a combination of all these factors, but there’s no denying the fact that a strategically planned release has really helped matters. The film has seen a limited release in 800 locations across 1,250 screens nationwide. “I know for a fact that the film didn’t release in Hyderabad, where SRK has a tremendous market, for a simple reason that it wouldn’t work there,” says Amul Mohan, trade expert and editor-in-chief of Super Cinema. “The collections would have dipped.” Closer home in Mumbai, the strategy continued with no shows screened at any Bandra cinema. Instead, [the producers] added shows in Juhu and Andheri, says Mohan, adding that the film capitalised on the fact that the exclusivity helped increase the buzz. “They wanted the film to work in all the 800 places it released, and so the team worked backwards [to ensure that],” says Mohan.
Of course, there would be no point in releasing the niche film in single-screen, non-urban areas where ticket transactions are cash heavy. “The film was essentially released only in multiplexes, so it (Rs. 44.7 crore) is a fairly decent number,” says Shailesh Kapoor, founder and CEO, Ormax Media Pvt. Ltd, a firm specialising in trade insights.
Plus, box office trackers will also have to see how Sujoy Ghosh’s Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh, which releases this Friday, will affect Dear Zindagi’s figures. After all, the Vidya Balan-starrer is a also non-commercial effort that will resonate with urban audiences.
“To see whether [Dear Zindagi] is a complete success, we will have to wait for the next two weeks,” says Kapoor, who thinks that Rs. 30 crore (net domestic) over the weekend is a good opening, but it’s clearly not a Dilwale (2015) or a Chennai Express (2013) in terms of a big SRK film. “Fan (2016) opened at Rs. 18 or 19 crore and didn’t reach Rs. 100 crore,” says Kapoor. “If Dear… does as much — between Rs. 70 to 75 crore — then it will be a bigger success.”
Trade analyst Amod Mehra, too, thinks it’s a tad early to declare the film a hit. “Based on the budget, the earnings have been satisfying, but not mindblowing. SRK films are supposed to do this, and it’s a happy situation for everybody, but there’s a long way to go for the film.” Mehra continues that Shinde’s feature has zero repeat value owing to a lack of a romantic angle and low entertainment quotient.
Whether or not the film has been declared a success, Dear Zindagi has strategically catered to urban multiplexes to ensure sure-fire ticket sales After all, where else would cashless transactions be as effective? It has ensured that the Bhatt-SRK starrer has avoided the demonetisation hullabaloo. “The impact has been smaller: not more than 10 to 20 per cent for Dear Zindagi,” concludes Kapoor setting the record straight.",Movies,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/Alia-SRK-escape-demonetisation-curse/article16738177.ece,
2016-12-01 01:12:00,HC refuses to pass orders on recovered demonetised notes,"MADURAI: The Madras High Court Bench here on Wednesday refused to pass any kind of orders with respect to exchange of demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes recovered by the police after November 9, when the demonetisation came into effect. The bench said there was every likelihood of false complaints of robbery and extortion being preferred to get black money converted into white through court orders.
While disposing of a public interest litigation petition taken up by the court suo motu to save demonetised notes that were in the custody of lower courts in the State in connection with various criminal cases before November 9, a Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran left it to the government to take an appropriate decision with respect to demonetised notes seized by police on or after November 9.
However, in so far as the currency notes that were in court custody before November 9 was concerned, the judges recorded the submission of Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan that the deadline of March 31, 2017 for exchanging the demonetised notes would not apply to the currency in court custody. It was made clear that such notes could be exchanged at any nationalised bank after the completion of trial along with a court order copy.
Taking note of the fact that in some cases, trial court had given interim custody of currency notes to their owners with a condition to keep them intact until the completion of trial, the Division Bench ordered that those having interim custody of such notes should return them to the lower court concerned and obtain an order to get them exchanged. While passing orders permitting exchange of those notes, the lower courts should mention the serial numbers of those notes, the judges clarified.
The court had taken suo motu notice of the issue after finding that Rs. 5.8 crore was in the custody of courts in 13 districts falling within the jurisdiction of the High Court Bench and of that money the courts in Karur district alone had demonetised Rs. 500 notes worth Rs.6.4 lakh and Rs.1,000 notes worth Rs. 44.09 lakh.",Madurai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/HC-refuses-to-pass-orders-on-recovered-demonetised-notes/article16733077.ece,
2016-12-01 22:30:00,Manufacturing PMI down in November on demonetisation effect,"Demonetisation has adversely impacted manufacturing growth in November, according to a private sector survey, which added that manufacturing conditions nevertheless improved for the eleventh consecutive month.
“The withdrawal of high-value banknotes in India reportedly hampered manufacturing growth in November, with companies signalling softer increases in order books, buying levels and output,” the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) said.
The headline figure for the PMI for India was 52.3 in November, with a reading over 50 indicating an expansion in activity. “However, down from October’s 22-month high of 54.4, the latest reading pointed to a modest upturn overall,” the report added.
“PMI data for November showed that the sudden withdrawal of high-value banknotes in India caused problems for manufacturers, as cash shortages hampered growth of new work, buying activity and production,” Pollyanna De Lima, Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report said. “However, whereas some may have anticipated an outright downturn, the sector held its ground and remained in expansion mode.”
The report said that the three sectors it monitored witnessed softer growth in November, with consumer goods producers recording a sharp slowdown in growth.
However, the prevailing conditions could point towards further cuts in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India.
“Of respite to firms, cost inflationary pressures softened, which in turn encouraged the vast majority of businesses to keep their selling prices unchanged,” Mr De Lima said. “If this trend is sustained we will likely see further cuts to the benchmark rate.”",Economy,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Manufacturing-PMI-down-in-November-on-demonetisation-effect/article16737922.ece,New Delhi
2016-12-01 08:01:00,‘Demonetisation wounds will take time to heal’," It will take three more months for the State to recover from the wounds caused by demonetisation. “There is acute shortage of Rs. 100 notes, Rs. 500 notes are not available, and Rs. 2,000 notes cannot be exchanged. It will take minimum three months for the dust to settle down,” D. Thomas Franco Rajendra Dev, senior vice-president of All India Bank Officers Confederation, told The Hindu.
From day one, new generation private banks were given more currency by the Reserve Bank of India. Even the State Bank of India (SBI), which maintains the largest currency chest, has been asked to collect cash from ICICI Bank in Chennai and HDFC Bank in Coimbatore. According to Mr. Franco, three private banks were given Rs. 6,100 crore while the remaining banks were given Rs. 7,800 crore. As of March 2016, Tamil Nadu has 9,971 bank branches including foreign banks and regional rural banks.
An official from a public sector bank said that December 1, the salary day is when the real heat would be felt. “There is a cash crunch and a fully loaded ATM runs out of cash in two hours. Customers are going to storm branches as soon as their salary lands in their accounts,” he said. Around 60 per cent of the ATMs in the State had started functioning but there was shortage of cash. 
On Wednesday, employees working in private firms got their salary credited into their accounts but were not able to withdraw it due to cash shortage. Many pensioners returned home empty handed. N.B.S. Mani, a retired BSNL employee who went to withdraw his pension money, had to return with an empty wallet.
Mr Franco said that December 1 was going to be a challenging day for bankers. “Other than works related to demonetisation, regular banking activities have come to a halt. Advances are going down. Non Performing Assets are increasing. Deferment of repayment has been impacted. These trends are unhealthy,” he added.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/%E2%80%98Demonetisation-wounds-will-take-time-to-heal%E2%80%99/article16734820.ece,CHENNAI

The problems being faced by the people at banks were only temporary, they said here on Thursday, and accused the opposition parties of blowing things out of proportion.
Both the leaders were here to attend the party’s training programme. 
Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Purandeswari said that the people wholeheartedly welcomed Prime Minister’s Narendra Modi’s demonetisation decision. 
“The decision to ban high-value currency notes has only bolstered the party’s image in the country. It, however, has shocked people who amassed black money,” she said.

A bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, while hearing a batch of pleas challenging various aspects of demonetisation, said all the parties should sit together and prepare a list of categories of cases that could be referred to High Courts and those that could be heard by the apex court.
Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said the government was aware of the situation in cooperative banks, which lacked proper infrastructure and mechanism, compared to scheduled banks.
“Entire chapter in the additional affidavit filed by the Centre is dedicated to the issue of cooperative banks. It is not that we are not aware of the situation but these [the cooperative banks] lack proper facilities, mechanism and proper infrastructure as compared to scheduled banks,” he said.
The government deliberately kept cooperative banks out of the drive as these did not have the expertise to detect fake currency.
Mr. Rohatgi said, “Several cases are filed each passing day in various high courts on various aspects post demonetisation and it is not possible to deal with cases simultaneously in Kerala, Kolkata, Jaipur and Mumbai... All these matter should be clubbed together and be referred to any one high court or the apex court should hear them.”
Senior advocate P. Chidambaram, appearing for cooperative banks, questioned the government’s decision, saying the rural economy is almost paralysed due to non-inclusion of cooperative banks.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of the petitioners, suggested that they will sit together and file the list of categories by Monday.

2016-12-02 18:56:00,Government’s demonetisation move faces legal challenge,"The November 8 circular issued by the Finance Ministry announcing the Government of India’s decision to pull out high value currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 from circulation, with immediate effect, is being challenged for its legal validity. Petitions challenging the move were in line to be heard before the Supreme Court on Friday, and are pending before various High Courts.
Drawing comparisons between the current government’s efforts and those taken by the Janata Government in 1978, a note issued by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) on Friday pointed out that the present government’s efforts were at variance with the demonetisation drive carried out by the Janata government, given that in 1978 a law had been promulgated for the exercise.
The High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 (HDBND Act) was introduced by the Janata government to govern the practice of demonetisation, and was later upheld for its constitutional validity by the Supreme Court in the Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah & Ors., vs. Reserve Bank of India case in 1996.
No Parliamentary sanction
Firstly, the CHRI note points to the contention that the demonetisation drive was launched by the present government without the sanction of a law passed by Parliament unlike in 1978. It referred to the arguments made by lawyer Indira Jaisingh in this regard.
Elaborating on the matter, the noted human rights lawyer and former Additional Solicitor General of India, Indira Jaisingh told The Hindu: “The November 8 notification was based on Section 26 sub-section (2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This section only allows you to withdraw a given series of notes from circulation. As per this legal section, the series of numbers of currency notes meant for withdrawal ought to be mentioned in the government notification. This section is not meant for demonetisation of every single currency note of that particular denomination as has been done now.”
She further added that the purpose of the said legal clause in RBI Act was not to replace every single note in circulation. “This is one problem. The other is that this section does not put a limit to withdrawal of money as the current government notification does. Any limits imposed on the withdrawal of tax paid money by citizens amounts to a temporary modification of their rights. Since money is property in your hands, the government will need a law to be able to do that.”
Also, responding to a query on whether the present government could override via executive fiat the existing law of the land, Ms. Jaisingh said that it depended on whether that law in question allows you to override it and contains a provision to enable the government do so, which is not the case right now.
Variations from 1978 law
Unlike the 1978 law, the present government notification does not prohibit the transfer of demonetised notes to persons other than banks. In the 1978 Act, Section 4 prohibited the transfer of the demonetised notes to anybody other than Scheduled Banks after the said currency notes had stopped being legal tender. Venkatesh Nayak, Programme Coordinator, CHRI’s Access to Information Programme, said that the absence of such provisions may have already allowed black money holders to transfer unaccounted for funds to third parties, thus subverting the very purpose of the current exercise.
The CHRI note also refers to the absence of a clause for declaring the source of the demonetised notes as was included in the earlier law. In the 1978 Act, Section 7 required every individual, company, trust or society intending to redeem the value of the demonetised notes to submit a declaration, in triplicate, with details of reasons for keeping the amount sought to be exchanged in high value denominations; source from which the demonetised notes were acquired; whether the person seeking to exchange the demonetised notes had borrowed them from any person, and if so, details were to be provided; and if the person making the declaration was not the owner of the demonetised notes, then the name of the true owner with a declaration that the notes were not held benami. The 1978 law also stipulated punishments for making false declarations at the time of depositing demonetised notes in the bank, but no such provisions were contained in the November 8 notification.
However, no such transparency and accountability measure was envisaged in the November 8 notification, CHRI observed, questioning the efficacy of the present exercise.

2016-12-02 14:24:00,Demonetisation: Where it stands now,"Weeks after the government demonetised high value currency and introduced Rs. 2000 notes, the Reserve Bank of India and the Finance Ministry made a series of announcements, and even modified its earlier ones depending on people’s reaction.
Read all of them at a glance below:
No more exchange
Scrapped Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes will no longer be exchanged at banks. From November 25, they can be exchanged only at RBI. However, these notes can be deposited at banks.
Earlier, banks were applying indelible ink mark on the right index finger of customers in select metro cities, to stop repeat money exchange with invalid currency notes.
No more old notes
Though old Rs. 500 notes were accepted in places such as petrol pumps, government hospitals, airports, and for paying government-related utility dues, Finance Ministry will be stopping this arrangement from Friday midnight.
Toll collection resumes
Commuters will now have to pay at toll plazas to ply in National Highways. Toll plazas will accept scrapped Rs.500 currency notes, provided the toll fee is higher than Rs. 200.
“The old Rs. 500 notes will be accepted till the midnight of December 15, but this will only be for purchasing FASTags and for making toll payments of more than Rs 200,” the Road Transport and Highways Ministry said in a statement.
Cap on Jan Dhan withdrawals
The RBI, in a notification issued on November 29, 2016, said Jan Dhan account holders can withdraw only up to Rs. 10,000 a month. The move was to protect rural account holders from activities of money laundering and legal consequences under the Benami Property Transaction & Money Laundering laws, it said.
Push to go cashless
Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged for a movement to turn India into a cashless society. He asked young people to teach mobile banking and other e-commerce technology to at least 10 families.
The government scrapped excise duty on point of service (POS) machines, waived off transaction charges on card payments till year-end, and also announced incentives such as cancellation of service charges in certain category to help promote electronic payments using debit card, Internet and mobile phones.
The government is widely publicising Unified Payment Interface (UPI), mobile wallets and prepaid cards.
Disclose bank transactions
Mr. Modi on November 29, 2016, asked BJP MPs, Ministers and MLAs to declare their bank transactions from November 8 (the day Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were demonetised) to December 31 to party president Amit Shah by January 1, 2017. With this step, the BJP wants to add more credibility to its anti-black money drive.
Amendments to IT Act
The Centre on November 28, introduced a Bill in the Lok Sabha — a proposal to impose 50 per cent tax on undeclared income that is voluntarily disclosed till December 30, following which 82.5 per cent (75 per cent tax and 10 per cent of such tax as penalty) could be levied on undeclared income detected by authorities. The tax changes are intended to supplement the demonetisation move targeted at curbing black money, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
Withdrawal limits eased
The RBI on November 28, 2016 said that if deposits had been made in legal tender, then depositors could withdraw that amount over and above the Rs. 24,000 weekly limit. The move was aimed at allowing comfort to individuals who were hesitant to deposit legal tender following the withdrawal of high-value currency notes which came into effect from November 9.
Opposition protests
A nationwide shutdown was called by Left parties against the demonetisation of high value currency. It evoked partial response. The Congress decided not to participate in the bandh. While the Left parties, including the CPI(M) and the CPI, called a 12-hour bandh to protest against the move in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress did not join it but held protests.
Leniency to farmers
To ensure sowing in the Rabi season, the government has allowed farmers to withdraw Rs. 25,000 a week against crop loan/kisan credit card. Traders in agricultural mandis will be permitted to draw Rs. 50,000 in cash per week to pay for sundry expenses like wages. While the time limit for payment of crop loan insurance premium has been extended by 15 days, government employees up to Group C have been given an option to draw salary advance in cash.",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Where-it-stands-now/article16742302.ece1,
2016-12-02 00:11:00,Traditional arts take a beating owing to demonetisation," Traditional crafts, already struggling to survive amidst machine-made goods flooding the markets, appear to be taking a further beating with demonetisation. Tales of artisans of three signature craft forms of Karnataka – Bidriware of Bidar, Kinnala toys of Koppal, and Channapatna toys of Ramanagaram – are testimony to this.
“We saw people line up before gold shops after demonetisation, but we did not expect silver rates to go up as well,” rued Abdul Bari, a third generation Bidri artisan. 
B-grade silver (lower in quality compared to what is used in jewellery), essential to the traditional metal handicraft of the region, has gone up from Rs. 475 per 10 grams to Rs. 600 now. This, coupled with poor sales, has hit people like Mr. Bari hard. Bidriware is made using copper, zinc and silver. Each artisan needs silver between one kg to three kgs a month.
Most of Bidri artisans’ transactions are cash based, says Rashid Ahmed Quadri, national award-winning artisan. “In my 40 years, I have never seen such a sudden drop in sales,” he said. A lot of Bidriware is sold online, but the participation of local artisans in that trade is negligible, said S. Shafi Ahmed, founder of Black Gold, a federation of Bidri artisans. 
Assistant artisan Ashok Ram, who earlier got paid every month, has not got paid for last two weeks. “The craftsmen are putting off payments citing that sales are less,” he said.
The toy story
The non-toxic wooden-and-lacquerware toys of Channapatna, which had recently gained a foothold in international market, are now feeling a push back too. The traditional toy makers say that counter sales have come down by nearly 90 per cent, while exports are not as badly hit. Shops that dot the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway selling Channapatna toys, between Mandya and Bidadi, are full of unsold wares. The fact that little toys cost between Rs. 10 and Rs. 80 makes them particularly susceptible to shortage of lower denomination notes.
Kinnala too
The Kinnal toy-makers in Koppal district, most of whom are Dalits, find themselves in a similar condition. Ajay Chitragar, an artisan, says that the toy-makers sell and collect money from traders, middlemen or societies. “Traders are either asking us to wait for one month or are offering less than the market price,” he said.
Worse, one person in the family is exclusively spending the entire man-day queueing up before the bank. “We had to go to the lone bank branch in Kinnal village and stand before the bank between 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Even then, there was no guarantee of getting the money,” he said.
“Though the government says you can withdraw Rs. 25,000 a week, the banks say they don’t have much cash and need to ration it out to all. This is adding to our problems,” he said.

2016-12-02 22:46:00,Demonetisation effect: Marriages on the rocks," The scarcity of cash in banks and the limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh withdrawal for marriages has become a cause for concern for parents.
After the announcement of demonetisation of high value currency notes and the Reserve Bank of India giving a go-ahead for higher limit of withdrawal for marriages, the parents, whose children are due to tie the knot, rushed to banks to withdraw the same. However, they were in for a rude shock.
Bankers have bluntly refused to give them the required cash stating that they have not received the necessary orders from the RBI.
Banks are harassing account holders to give proof of wedding, copies of receipts of advances made to function halls and caterers, etc. They were also asked to provide details of persons to whom the amount is to be paid, together with a declaration from such persons that they do not have any bank account. 
A municipal employee, who was to get his daughter married on December 8, is worried with the attitude of bankers who have been denying him cash of up to Rs. 2.5 lakh on the pretext that he was not following RBI guidelines. “It is horrible that the banks are refusing to give me my hard-earned money for my daughter’s wedding. I am unable to pay my debts as well,” he said.
M. Prathap Reddy, a headmaster of a government school, said his daughter was scheduled to get married on December 22 and he has not been able to buy anything due to the cash crunch. “I am struggling to get evidences of advance payments made to various persons. If I spend the entire time at banks trying to get the required cash, when will I distribute the wedding cards and make other purchases?” he lamented.
On the other hand, bankers say that they have several restrictions on the cash withdrawal. “We are providing only Rs. 10,000 to the account holders, including employees, against the limit of Rs. 24,000 per week as there is no cash in the banks,” a banker said.",Telangana,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Demonetisation-effect-Marriages-on-the-rocks/article16750555.ece,KARIMNAGAR
2016-12-02 02:43:00,Demonetisation biggest scam in Indian history: Kejriwal ,"Demonetisation was the “biggest scam of Indian history” which aimed to collect the hard-earned money of common people and use it to bail out industrialists through banks, alleged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at a rally in Meerut on Thursday. This was the first of the series of rallies the Aam Aadmi Party has planned across the country against demonetisation. 
“Who has praised demonetisation? Did common people praise the move? No, it was industrialists like Adani, Ambani and Vijay Mallya who praised it. The common masses, the farmer, the small trader, labourer, are all standing in queues all day,” said Mr. Kejriwal. 
“Had demonetisation intended to bring back black money, then farmers, poor people and labourers would not have suffered heart attack while standing in queues, but people like Vijay Mallya should have been acted against,” asserted the Delhi Chief Minister. 
“Since the time Modiji became Prime Minister, he has written off loans to the tune of Rs. 1.14 lakh crore which were taken by his industrialist friends. I want to know how much money was exchanged between the Modi government and these industrialists,” he said. 
“After the loan of Rs. 1.14 lakh crore was written off, banks were empty and about to be bankrupt then Modiji and BJP leaders like Amit Shah came up with this plan. This is not my allegation; reports of the Reserve Bank of India and the CAG say that industrialists did not pay back loan to the tune of Rs. 8 lakh crore. Now where will that money come.

2016-12-03 23:51:00,Impact of demonetisation on party politics in Karnataka," The demonetisation of high-value currency has no doubt had an impact on all sections of the population, leave alone trade and business, and in Karnataka, this is expected to impact party politics as well. 
It is common knowledge that the Bharatiya Janata Party enjoys considerable clout in Bengaluru in particular and the State in general, thanks to the patronage of trade and industry, particularly the informal sector. Added to this is the large number of businessmen hailing from several northern and western States forming part of flourishing businesses here, who have extended considerable support to the BJP over the years. 
The demonetisation drive has largely affected this section of people, and it’s obvious that they believe the root cause of all their monetary problems, with the need to account for all their transactions, is thanks to the policy decisions of the BJP government at the Centre. A cross section of the people in this sector, who largely have their business offices in the core areas of Bengaluru, told The Hindu that their businesses have been hard hit and it may take a long time to recover. 
The salaried class and in particular the employees of the Information Technology sector, who constitute nearly a fifth of the population of Bengaluru are evidently happy with demonetisation since they believe that the measures being adopted by the Union government will work against the increasing corruption at all levels of the bureaucracy and in politics. Political corruption and bribery demands of the bureaucracy have resulted in a multitude of problems and there is no check at the present juncture, with the Karnataka Lokayukta remaining without a chief and the newly constituted Anti-Corruption Bureau merely remaining a wing of the State government. 
Demonetisation has come about at a time when the popularity of the State Congress and in particular that of the Siddaramaiah government is sinking in contrast to the growing influence of the BJP. It is another matter that there is serious intra party differences within the BJP, and efforts are still on to bring about a rapprochement among some of the senior BJP leaders such as K.S. Eshwarappa (Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council), who have raised their voice of dissent against the party president and former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. It has also been announced that should the BJP wrest power from the Congress, then Mr. Yeddyurappa will be the obvious choice for the post of Chief Minister. 
This apart, there are unconfirmed reports that some of the State BJP leaders were privy to information on demonetisation well ahead of the Prime Minister’s announcement on November 8, resulting in some of them indulging in business takeovers and other activities to provide a makeover to their illegal wealth. 
The common people, who are witness to all this accumulation of wealth, believe that demonetisation and other follow-up operations should serve to put an end to such illegalities. 
What is now to be seen is the strategy that the State unit of the BJP will adopt to ensure that it does not suffer any hit to its popularity. That the one-day bandh called by the Opposition parties on November 28 did not work to the advantage of the ruling Congress did provide some relief to the BJP in Karnataka.

2016-12-03 22:21:00,"Post demonetisation, Hyundai opts for coastal route to move cars"," The logistics service sector has been badly impacted for the last three weeks due to the Centre’s demonetisation move. 
Besides, the non-availability of Rs.100 notes has made it difficult for logistic service providers to aggregate large number of vehicles as truck drivers need money to meet fuel, toll and other expenses. Usually, large number of trucks are hired to move goods from Tamil Nadu to other parts of the country.
Having gained rich experience of moving cars from one port to another, Hyundai Motor India Ltd., (HMIL) has started tilting towards the coastal route. Out of the total volume, 96 per cent of cars are sent through road and rest by rail.
On Monday, HMIL will be moving 2,500 cars through Roll-on Roll-off vessel to Kandla from Kamarajar Port at Ennore. From there, trucks would be deployed to dispatch cars to Mumbai, Gujarat, National Capital Region and Rajasthan. Last month, HMIL shipped 1,450 cars through coastal route.
“Due to the Centre’s demonetisation move, sufficient number of specialised trucks are not available to lift cars. This will badly affect the delivery schedule and also our production volume in the coming days. As of now, we have not cut our production volume,” said V. Anand, HMIL Senior General Manager, Outbound Logistics.
Mr. Anand said a delay in delivery schedule would place the dealers in a tight spot, as they would have borrowed money to book the cars. They have to pay interest from day one. HMIL was trying to compensate them. Besides, the dealers had to handle customers.
“Initially, our service provider faced some last mile issue. Now that has been sorted out. We are now depending on coastal movement,” he said. 
For 2016, HMIL planned to produce five lakh cars for domestic markets and 1.6 lakh cars for export. ",Industry,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/Post-demonetisation-Hyundai-opts-for-coastal-route-to-move-cars/article16756402.ece,CHENNAI
2016-12-03 00:37:00,Living with demonetisation,"The political opposition to demonetisation — evident in what one sees in Parliament, and outside it — leaves much to be desired (“Modi’s presence in Rajya Sabha fails to break the ice”, Dec.2). Our Members of Parliament seem to forget that they are there to highlight the problems faced in their constituencies and find redress for them. Instead, they raise issues that have no relevance to any parliamentary discussion, an example being the delay in the landing of a flight on which the Chief Minister of West Bengal was a passenger (“Turbulence over Mamata flight delay”, Dec.2).
How can there be any objection to the steps being taken by the government to wipe out the black economy? In view of the enormity of the problem, there will be some temporary inconvenience to the common man.
S. Chidambaresa Iyer, Chennai
If the circulation of counterfeit notes is said to be rampant, it speaks poorly of the vigilance agencies. If the new notes reach antisocial and terrorist groups, say after a year or two, will the government roll out demonetisation once again? When much of India is outside the Internet age, why talk of the cashless mode now?
R. Ranganathan, Ahmedabad
I have been following Indian politics for about a decade and can say that this is the first time I have seen a Prime Minister who has had the courage to take hard but imperative decisions. Obviously he knew that the execution of demonetisation could end up badly and dent his image, but he wanted to keep this exercise a secret, to maximise its efficiency. I have not suffered its effects, so it is wrong for me to make comments. I am supremely confident that the country is radically improving for the first time in so many years and hope that the momentum is not lost.
Mihir Bhagat, Evanston, Illinois, U.S.
Demonetisation is being heralded as a direct fight against black money; in fact even the U.S. said that it is a necessary step (Dec.2). But the Central government must keep in mind the adage “history repeats itself” if the recovery of nearly Rs.4 crore in new currency notes from government officials and Rs.2,000 notes from insurgents is an indication. Such elements will go to any extent to recover what they have lost due to demonetisation. To tackle this, the government should strengthen institutions such as the anti-corruption bureau while IT officials should institute a strong grievance redressal mechanism, appointing Lokayuktas in all States. There should also be greater awareness of RTI.

2016-12-04 20:11:00,Demonetisation flawed in execution: Sharad Pawar," While lauding the rationale behind Centre’s demonetisation policy, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday said its “execution was deeply flawed”.
Comparing the policy to a medical operation, Mr. Pawar said, “Despite the doctor having performed a successful operation, there was a chance that the patient’s health could deteriorate rapidly as proper care wasn’t being taken.”
Speaking at a party meeting here, Mr. Pawar expressed scepticism over the notion of a ‘cashless economy’ in agriculture-focused regions of India. The Maratha strongman also claimed that 92 per cent of the country’s transactions are cash-based.
He also disapproved of Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) November 14 order that prohibited cooperative banks from accepting or exchanging the discarded Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 currency notes, and said that the district central cooperative banks (DCCB) of Maharashtra were sitting on a cash pile of nearly Rs. 5000 crore.
“The RBI ban has disrupted the economic life in rural areas with no provision of what exactly is to be done with the large amount collected in old notes by the DCCBs,” Mr. Pawar said.
Commenting on his often remarked closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Pawar said he considers issues of national importance over indulging in politics.
“It is often remarked that I am very close to Mr. Modi. But when it comes to issues of national importance, I’ve never indulged in politics or considered whether the Prime Minister is from the Opposition. Party politics must be transcended to resolve pressing issues like agrarian matters or other similar issues,” he said.

2016-12-04 00:36:00,Demonetisation: Cash woes leave handicraft sector in dire straits ," Handicraft sector in Mysuru is tottering for survival owing to the impact of demonetisation with artisans barely churning out a fraction of their normal output following a drop in demand. 
Almost one month into the demonetisation exercise and with no signs of abatement of currency crunch, there are fears that continued crisis could result in artisans quitting their profession. 
Though the crisis and downturn has affected every sector, work orders for handicraft artisans do not come on a daily basis as in the case of casual labourers. Hence, the dwindling number of orders for handicraft products affects them more. Besides, the number of tourists visiting Mysuru had reduced owing to the current crisis and hence their sales had taken a beating. 
S. Ramu, an artisan and member of the Handicraft Manufacturers Association, told The Hindu that handicraft sales had fallen by 50 per cent to 60 per cent and had affected both daily wagers and skilled artisans. “Despite slowdown in sales, the skilled artisans have to be paid to retain their services failing which they would quit,” he said. 
Even emporiums which promote handicraft products and help artisans and the art form thrive, have reported poor sales in the last one month, Mr. Ramu said. “However, some entrepreneurs with bank accounts are drawing from their reserves to pay workers but there is a limit of Rs. 24,000,” he added. 
The sector sustains nearly 6,000 artisans and daily wagers in Mysuru, which is known for wood inlay and engravings among others. There are nearly 200 units engaged in the manufacture of various craft products most of which are wood-based. The Mysuru wood inlay work is among the more popular items and has been accorded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. 
This is the second blow to the handicraft sector in recent times after the exports and domestic sales took a beating during the economic downturn a few years ago. But with public money locked up in banks owing to paucity of new notes, domestic sales too had plummeted. 
The association believes the hiccup is temporary and realising the imperatives of going cashless, plans to encourage artisans to migrate to e-banking and plastic money.

2016-12-04 18:43:00,Issue white paper on demonetisation: Congress to Centre ,"
 Congress today demanded a white paper from the Centre on the demonetisation move which it claimed is the “biggest scam of India” and sought a probe into it by a Joint Parliamentary Committee.
“We want to know with whom did the Central government hold discussion about demonetisation. The government should issue a white paper on this,” senior party leader Digvijay Singh told reporters here.
“A Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) should probe the entire issue of demonetisation which helped BJP and its men convert black money into assets,” he said.
Mr. Singh alleged that even the Prime Minister’s Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian and other officials were in the dark about the impending demonetisation.
“Some people had information in advance which is evident from the fact that Rs one crore were deposited in BJP’s account in a Kolkata bank in addition to the party buying land in Bihar and Odisha,” he claimed.
Singh, a Rajya Sabha member, was in the state capital as part of the party’s strategy to get people acquainted with the Congress’ view on demonetisation.
He was accompanied by Bihar Congress chief and Bihar Education Minister Ashok Choudhary, Sadanand Singh, Dilip Kumar Choudhary, H.K. Verma and others.
Terming demonetisation as the “biggest scam of India”, Mr. Singh alleged that Punjab BJP’s legal cell co-convenor Sanjeev Kamboj had put his photograph on social media with wads of new notes of Rs. 2,000 that raises a question mark on the BJP leaders having free access to new currency notes when the common people are standing in lines to withdraw money.
He pointed out that the Modi government increased the “limit of foreign remittances from India” from 75,000 to 2.5 lakh US Dollars, and alleged that the decision led to an outflow of nearly Rs. 30,000 crore from the country only in one year prior to demonetisation.
“Whose money was sent out is yet to be disclosed,” Mr. Singh said. ",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Issue-white-paper-on-demonetisation-Congress-to-Centre/article16759449.ece,Patna

In a statement here on Sunday, the CPI(M) State secretariat said the Modi government was pushing for a cashless economy, which was not feasible in a country like India with a population that was not covered by debit or credit cards. 
The party was not opposed to strong action against corruption. But it was with the people who were suffering because of the Centre’s demonetisation without proper preparation and the consequent shortage in currency supply.
The State secretariat protested against the Centre’s actions that virtually paralysed the rationing system in the State. The local level campaign will focus on the disruption in ration supply owing to the Centre’s action in the name of implementing the Food Safety Act.
The State had requested the Centre to provide time to Kerala for implementing the Act. As a result of the Centre’s refusal to give more time, a large number of eligible persons were left out of the priority list for ration eligibility.

Dr. Isaac told reporters here on Monday that Keralites were responsive and such issues could be resolved only through public protest. Dr. Isaac also denied the charge that he was involved in fear-mongering. He refuted Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala’s charge that the State lacked preparedness in addressing the crisis. 
He had apprised Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of the problems that were likely to arise due to cash crunch, held discussions with Reserve Bank of India personnel and the intent for daily cash requirement in the treasuries was placed after mutual discussions. The government had also made arrangements to ensure that payments were not delayed due to cash crunch.
The problem was not with the preparations, but with the Centre’s decision to withdraw 86 per cent currency at one go. He accused the Centre of vitiating the atmosphere in holding discussions on Goods and Services Tax.

2016-12-04 02:22:00,,"Long before Viagra hit the market in 1998, the vaidyas (‘physicians’) of Katrisarai in Bihar’s Nalanda district were running highly successful businesses mailing products plugged as aphrodisiacs and cures for a variety of mainly sexual and skin ailments to seekers of cures who prefer anonymity.
The average monthly revenue of the Katrisarai sub-post office prior to demonetisation was a startling Rs. 75-90 lakh, though post-demonetisation, from November 9 to 30, it was down to a mere Rs. 18.82 lakh. “This is actually a sub-post office and yet, it’s the top revenue generating post office in the State and is also among the top 10 [revenue generating post offices] in the country,” postmaster Nagendra Prasad told The Hindu. 
The nondescript village with a population of nearly 8,000 has been a hub for vaidyas — some allegedly fake, others said to be genuine — who offer shartiya elaaz (guaranteed treatment) with locally mixed powders. “It has been like cottage industry here since the British period. I am the fourth generation of my family doing this business,” 59-year-old Kishore Kumar told The Hindu. Mr. Kumar says there are 40-50 “genuine” vaidyas in the town. But the post office has a list of 179 vaidyas who regularly courier their formulations in insured parcels.
Going places
Inside the freshly whitewashed post office, which functions out of an old house, rows of large plastic bags containing small wooden boxes packed with locally mixed formulations are ready to be sent off to every corner of the country — Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. “Parcels from here were earlier even sent to some African countries, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan,” said a post office employee. “We undertake only insured value payable post parcels and charge Rs. 103 for each weighing up to 500 grams.” 
Most of Katrisarai’s self-styled vaidyas build their enterprises with advertisements published in vernacular newspapers of various States with their contact numbers. Ami Chand, an Ayurvedic practitioner, is said to have first succeeded in such an enterprise from here and, since then, his legacy has been taken forward by his family members and other villagers. Today, almost every household here has a vaidya. The prosperity that the business has brought to the village can be seen both in the way the houses are built and in the SUVs parked outside them.
Demonetisation has changed all that. 
‘Fraud and fake’
Pinki Prasad, station in charge of the Katrisarai police station, says “Most of them [the vaidyas] are fraud and fake. Several of them have also been arrested in the past five years.” This year, over two dozen people have been arrested, while in September 2012, altogether 70 people were arrested, she adds.
On the police station premises, heaps of seized wooden boxes containing fake aphrodisiacs and drugs are piled in one corner. “We are [now] getting income details of the self-proclaimed vaidyas here from the post office and bank accounts to send them to the Income Tax Department. They earn in crores but pay almost nil tax,” investigating officer Rajesh Kumar told The Hindu.
Demonetisation appears to have stopped these enterprises in their tracks. It [demonetisation] has rendered us paupers. Our couriered parcels are being returned every day and we are also not able to buy raw materials from the local market as we have no cash. The workers too have gone away as we are not able to pay them in the new currency notes,” echoes a group of vaidyas, including Uma Charan Chaurasia, Mukesh Kumar Gupta, Pappu Kumar Chaurasia, Jay Prakash Prasad and Kishore Kumar.",,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Katrisarai%E2%80%99s-old-nostrums-stagger-on-demonetisation-shot/article16757455.ece,KATRISARAI (NALANDA) 
2016-12-05 18:38:00,Revenue from property registration in district shrink on demonetization,"KOCHI: Demonetization of high-value currency notes in early November has brought down property registration in the district substantially.
A senior Registration Department official said on Monday that the number of property registrations on a normal day used to be around 350 documents. However, post-demonetization, the number has come down to around a hundred documents a day.
The week immediately following the announcement of demonetization on November 8, saw absolutely no registration activities as people appeared confused and had no valid currency to carry out the deals, said the official.
This week has seen registration picking up but not at the levels before demonetization, the official added. He also said that registration of around a hundred property deeds, 30 to 40 registrations of wills and a few Powers of Attorney are registered these days during a day.
It implies also that the volume of revenue realized from registration process is also down. Almost all the registration offices in the district met their annual revenue target last year. The targets were met despite several adverse factors. However, the volume of revenue is down to less than 60 per cent this year, the official added pointing out that demonetization was the immediate cause for the phenomenon.
However, property developers have ruled out demonetization hitting real property deals and development because most of the housing deals are bank linked and depend on the loans extended by the banks. 
Document writers have pointed a clutch of factors that had affected property deals even before the demonetization announcement. The fall in the price of natural rubber, declining remittances from the Gulf countries on falling oil price and high rate of charges on registration had dissuaded people during most part of last year. The government’s decision to hike the fair value of property too had played a role in slowing down new property registrations.

Addressing a symposium on ‘demonetisation: towards a corruption-free and cashless society’ organised by the Telangana Yuvajana Sanghaala Samakhya here on Monday, Mr. Laxman said a lot many preparations preceded the move, which were either ridiculed or ignored by the Opposition parties.
Soon after coming to power riding on the promise to eradicate black money, Mr. Modi had constituted a special investigation team for exploring ways to bring out black money in the country. His frequent tours abroad were meant to enter into information exchange agreements with the respective governments so that laws in the country may be amended against holding black money, he said.
A total of 25 crore bank accounts were opened by way of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, owing to which transparency was improved. Middlemen were eliminated with the direct benefit transfer to the poor. Though black money hoarders were given a chance to declare it through voluntary disclosure, many had not taken it seriously. Combination of Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and mobile banking was the way to root out corruption, Mr. Laxman said.
The demonetisation move had disabled the export of terrorism by Pakistan by stopping the circulation of fake currency notes. Normalcy had returned to Kashmir valley where students were busy writing examinations.

2016-12-05 01:29:00,‘Demonetisation is a road to nowhere’,"Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Sunday said while the people in the country are ready to subject themselves to any hardship to eradicate black money, demonetisation was not a solution as it was a flawed concept. Mr. Thirumavalavan’s stand is in stark contrast to the one taken by MDMK leader and People’s Welfare Front (PWF) convener Vaiko, who has been pretty vocal in his support of the demonetisation scheme. The VCK and the two Left parties are part of the PWF.
“People are ready to even forego food if the government’s effort will result in putting an end to black money. But demonetisation will take us nowhere. On the other hand, it is helping small black money holders to covert their currencies into white through banks. The suspension of bank officials and a few individuals obtaining new currencies in bulk prove my argument,” Mr. Thirumavalavan told The Hindu.
The Dalit leader said black money had become part of Indian political and electoral system and privatisation had made the situation worse. “Unless you reform the political and electoral system, you cannot eradicate black money. Today, the situation has come to such a pass that political parties cannot function without black money and elections cannot be won without bribing voters,” he said.
According to him, the private sector was thriving in the country only on black money and self-financing educational institutions proliferated by collecting capitation fee and donations.
“Everyone knows that parents have to pay several lakhs of rupees to get an engineering seat in private colleges and the price for a medical seat has touched one crore rupees. Parents pay the money under the table and this is nothing but black money. Has the government taken any steps to stop commercialisation of education in the country which in turn helped a few individuals amassing black money and foraying into other business ventures,” he asked.
Mr. Thirumavalavan did not agree that Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept his decision on demonetisation as a secret to prevent even his colleagues from getting wind of it. “Now, it has come to light that the address he made to the nation was a recorded speech. What is the guarantee that those who had recorded the speech had not revealed it to others? If he is under compulsion to keep such a serious issue as a secret, does he agree that he cannot trust even his Cabinet colleagues or say that they are agents of black money holders,” he wanted to know.
It was laughable if the Indian government, with its powerful government machinery and adequate laws, was not able to zero-in on black money holders and had to resort to demonetisation. “Even a layman knows who is holding black money in his area and the government, instead of targeting them, has taken a circuitous route,” he charged.
Asked about the difference of opinion among the partners of the PWF, particularly Mr. Vaiko, he said they had agreed to disagree.
“We will work together on issues when there is a consensus. There is no need to discuss about an issue which eludes a consensus. The VCK and the MDMK share the same stand on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue and the LTTE. But the Left parties approach it from a different angle and it has not created any wedge between us,” he said.",Tamil Nadu,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/%E2%80%98Demonetisation-is-a-road-to-nowhere%E2%80%99/article16760835.ece,CHENNAI
2016-12-05 21:53:00,Economic Survey could have entire chapter on demonetisation: Govt official,"NEW DELHI: The Economic Survey of 2016-17 could include a special chapter on demonetisation and its implications on the economy, a top government official told The Hindu, adding that it could address concerns being expressed about the move amounting to expropriation of private wealth by the government.
“Every year in the first volume of the Economic Survey, there are eight special chapters. Demonetisation will be one of the 11-12 chapters likely this time,” a top government official said, requesting anonymity.
While he agreed with the assessment of several economists and rating agencies that demonetisation would hit consumption in the short run, the official stressed that private consumption would bounce back soon.
When asked if the increase in bank deposits due to demonetisation will allow for greater lending again for infrastructure projects and boost private investment, the official said this is an unlikely scenario.
“Demonetisation does not address the private sector’s issues,” the official explained. “You have to address the non-performing assets issue, and the fact that private sector balance sheets are shot. Unless you do that, private investment will not come.”
The official mooted that the best way to utilise the surplus generated due to demonetisation would be to deploy it for creating fresh capacity and assets.
“A good practice if you have a wealth gain is to use it for capital purposes and not to try and convert a wealth gain into an income gain,” he said. “Essentially, you don’t want to spend out of this gain. You want to create assets. You can recapitalise the banks. But what you do with the money is a political call.”

2016-12-05 00:36:00,Puducherry seeks compensation for 15 p.c. demonetisation loss in trade ," Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Sunday said that Puducherry has incurred a loss of 15 per cent in trade because of the demonetisation move. 
Addressing the media on Sunday in the Assembly building, he said: “The business transaction of traders has come down from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 50,000. The industrial production has been affected. People who have deposited Rs. 2 lakh are able to withdraw only Rs. 2,000. The unorganised sectors and rural population have been affected the most. The farmers are worst hit as they are unable to buy seeds or fertilisers.”
Mr. Narayanasamy said he had urged the Centre to compensate the tax losses incurred by the States because of demonetisation. “The RBI can print only Rs. 30 crore a month as against the requirement of Rs. 14 lakh crore. This problem will not be resolved in a year,” he added.
He said at least 57 people have died during this period. “I support the Prime Minister’s intention to eradicate black money. But they have declared 86 per cent of the cash invalid and failed to make any alternative arrangements. There is no money in the banks,” he said.
“Out of the 130 crore people, only 40 crore people use plastic money while the rest are still dependent on cash,” he said.
He said that during a recent meeting on the GST at the Centre, he was able to convince the Finance Minister to provide compensation for the loss incurred by Puducherry.
Gas pipeline
Under the Ennore to Kanyakumari gas pipeline project, the Puducherry government has requested the Centre to provide piped gas supply to Puducherry and Karaikal. “In the Andhra gas pipeline project that would connect 18 districts, Yanam has the possibility of getting connected,” he said.
The Chief Minister said the government was determined to implement 3 per cent reservation for the people with disability in education and employment. 
He underscored that the government had sanctioned Rs. 527 crore per annum to buy power from Neyveli and Central power grid.
Agricultural University
The Chief Minister said the agricultural college in Karaikal would be upgraded to State agricultural university. “This would help in further research in the field,” he said. 
Puducherry government was going to call for a global tender for waste management. He said the U.S. and Chinese companies had shown interest in providing machinery required to convert waste into compost.
“Using that technology, we could use the waste dumped in 15 acres of land. This process will economically benefit the government. Earlier, we had planned to burn the waste, which would incur an expenditure of Rs. 17 crore. However, the new waste management plan will not have any loss. The government has taken up the initiative to build toilets in the rural and urban areas of the Union Territory of Puducherry.”
The MHRD had agreed to consider the demand for setting up an Institute of Management in Puducherry, Mr. Narayanasamy said.",Puducherry,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/Puducherry-seeks-compensation-for-15-p.c.-demonetisation-loss-in-trade/article16760395.ece,PUDUCHERRY
2016-12-05 18:21:00,Demonetisation hits liquor sale,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The demonetisation scheme that was announced by the Central government on November 8 has affected the sale of liquor across Visakhapatnam district and also in almost all districts in the State.
In Visakhapatnam city alone, the sale has plummeted by about 35 to 40 per cent and in the rural areas it is down by about 30 to 35 per cent.
The average sale in Visakhapatnam district is about Rs. 120 crore to Rs.130 crore per month and in the month of November it drops to around Rs.110 to Rs.120 crore, as the liquor consumption slows down due to ‘Karthika masam.’ But this year, the sales in the month of November dropped to about Rs. 99 crore compared to Rs. 123 crore last year, according to a senior officer from the Prohibition and Excise Department. 
“The last week of November was the worst hit, as from November 24 the retailers completely stopped accepting the bigger denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, which ceased to be legal tenders, as per the government order,” he said.
Withdrawal of bigger denomination notes from circulation, lack of money in banks, withdrawal from banks being curtailed and lack of small change with retailers are cited as the reasons for the downtrend. 
A senior officer from East Godavari aired a similar view and according to him there is an overall drop of about 40 per cent in revenue across all the districts in the State.
Despite drop in sales, the purchases by the retailers from the state-owned depots have gone up. It is estimated that the average monthly purchase for the month of November has gone up by about 10 to 20 per cent. 
In East Godavari district the purchase of beer in the month of November in 2015 stood at about 93,000 cases, and in the corresponding period this year, it was 1.20 lakh cases.
Senior officers indicate that retailers used the opportunity to dispose of the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes to purchase the stock, despite the sales being less. 
To support the traders, the government has removed the ‘minimum monthly sales’ clause from November, till normalcy is restored, says a liquor shop owner. 
Moreover, the government has asked the retailers to pay the quarterly licence fee in advance and many had used this opportunity to exchange the old notes by paying the fee in advance. 
But the excise officials feel that the dip in the sales is a temporary phenomenon and it will bounce back this month. ",Visakhapatnam,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Demonetisation-hits-liquor-sale/article16764108.ece,
2016-12-06 18:17:00,Chartered accountantshail demonetisation ,"TIRUPATI: Terming the demonetisation drive a significant step, members of the Chartered Accountants fraternity have hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision and opined that it will help channelise national resources for growth and development of the country. 
Speaking at the inaugural session of the 48th regional conference of Southern Indian Regional Council (SIRC) of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) held at Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University (SVVU) grounds here on Tuesday, they remarked that it would definitely have a telling impact on the nation’s economy. “It is a welcome step by the Central government to address the issues such as black money, fake currency and funding for terrorist organisations. For the sake of national security and inclusive growth, we have urged all our members to guide their clients and the general public in the right direction,” asserted ICAI Chairman M. Devaraja Reddy. 
Mr. Reddy further said that though there might be a few problems in the beginning, the decision of demonetisation would augur well in the long run. He called upon various branch heads to conduct awareness programmes in all the 44 centres in South India, and also elucidate on other prevailing issues. He also emphasised on CAs updating their respective skills and working towards upholding the trust of the people. 
Chittoor MP N. Sivaprasad, who presided over, urged the chartered accountants to contribute their part in allaying the fears of common man by spreading awareness on the issue. “Though a great step, the withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes, has put people in a state of confusion. In this context, the financial experts should explain the reason behind the decision to the people,” he remarked. 
Tirupati Legislator M. Suguna further emphasised on the need for conducting awareness programmes to promote financial literacy along with the prevailing developments. 
The two-day conference focuses on the issues such as demonetisation, updates on Goods and Service Tax (GST), Income Declaration Scheme (IDS), issues related to audit firms, accounting reforms in railways, few pilot studies, certificate courses and much more. SIRC Chairman E. Phalguna Kumar, Canara Bank Chairman T.N. Manoharan, Amara Raja Group Chairman Galla Ramachandra Naidu and representatives from various branches took part in the conference on the first day.

2016-12-06 02:08:00,Nitish makes a U-turn on demonetisation,": After supporting demonetisation, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move towards a cashless economy. 
“It may be the imagination or thought [of someone] but for a country like India, it is not possible to have 100 per cent cashless economy. The world may be moving towards a cashless economy but in India, in view of the social structure, social milieu and people’s habits, cash transactions would continue,” he said while addressing journalists on the sidelines of his first weekly ‘Lok Samvad’ interaction. 
In this programme, Mr. Kumar seeks feedback and suggestions on his government’s development and welfare programmes from a group of people on the first three Mondays of the month.
On Monday, 34 people from different districts of the State provided feedback on issues such as irrigation, roads, construction and energy.
‘BJP should answer’
Mr. Kumar added, “There have recently been documentary disclosures by the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) leaders on land purchases made by the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) in Bihar. The BJP should answer the charges made against them. Whose money was it? From where has it come?” 
He added, “The State’s land registration department will look into it but it has not come to my level yet.”
On the question of Union Minister Giriraj Singh’s proposal for sterilisation to control population in the country, the Bihar Chief Minister said, “It is all frivolous talk. What happened to all those who had earlier advocated for sterilisation? There are several central and State government programmes for this. Population can be controlled through education and not by sterilisation”.

2016-12-06 01:17:00,Opposition uproar in both Houses over demonetisation ,"NAGPUR: A united Opposition tried to corner the Devendra Fadnavis government over demonetisation in the lower House of the State legislature on the first day of its winter session on Monday, while in the Upper House, Maharashtra Council chairman Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar had to order the State government to hold a meeting with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley along with representatives from the Opposition and of district central cooperative banks, which are facing trouble.
Senior Congress leader and leader of the Opposition in the State Legislative Assembly, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, gave a notice of adjournment on demonetisation and demanded immediate discussion on the issue as the House did not have question hour in its schedule on Monday.
Mr. Vikhe-Patil said, “People all over the State are facing difficulties due to the note ban. We support this decision to stop corruption, but are against the way it is being implemented. Common people, especially small farmers, are badly hit. This decision should have disturbed corrupt people but only the common people are facing hardships. The government’s administration, devoid of planning, has suffocated people. Many in the ruling party are opposed to this decision but they can’t speak their mind because of the Central government’s pressure on them. Prices of almost every farm produce are down due to this note ban. The government has to come clear on this.”
The Nationalist Congress Party leader Mr. Ajit Pawar claimed that the 125-crore population of India supported action against black money holders.
In the Upper House, Dhananjay Munde, Leader of the Opposition in the State Council, alleged that the demonetisation drive has cost the State’s farmers Rs. 20,000 crore. “The rates of agricultural produce have fallen drastically. Labourers are not being paid as no cash is available with farmers and with the Rabi season, sowing has hit hard as no cash is available with them. We want to know what steps the government has taken to ease pressure from the rural economy,” said Mr. Munde.
Congress leader Narayan Rane blamed the government of using demonetisation to divert the attention of people from its failures to deliver on election promises, which led to a verbal altercation between him and Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar.
In the Assembly, Haribhau Bagde denied permission for an adjournment motion, which infuriated Opposition members, while in the Upper House, Mr. Naik-Nimbalkar too denied permission to conduct the discussion on the first day. Mr. Mungantiwar tried to pacify the Opposition by conceding that the people were facing “some problems” while implanting this “historic decision”.",Mumbai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Opposition-uproar-in-both-Houses-over-demonetisation/article16765320.ece,
2016-12-06 01:30:00,‘Demonetisation will boost the economy in the long run’ ," The Andhra Chambers of Commerce and Industries Federation strongly felt that the demonetisation policy of the Union government would boost the economy in the long run and help entrepreneurs get loans at lower interest rates. 
The federation felt that huge cash flows at banks would benefit entrepreneurs to get loans at affordable rates. 
It is also hopeful that the transparency would come at every level and make way for industrial progress in the State. The organisation asked the government to come with simple taxation policy to achieve the goals of demonetisation.
Federation president-elect G. Sambasiva Rao said that demonetisation policy might lead to cash crunch initially but flow of money would be normal within a couple of months. 
“Currently, the industries are facing many difficulties with higher interest rates. It is the time for the government to extend support to us by lowering interest rates by 2 per cent. We hope it would be possible for the government to do so with the huge cash flow which can be used for industrial growth in the country. It naturally boost the economy and create a huge number of jobs,” he added.
According to him, The federation requested the Union and the the State governments to focus on agro-based industries in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts for creation of more jobs in rural areas and arrest the migration of people. It urged the government to crate infrastructure such as road connectivity to industries and storage points. 
“By-products of cashew, coconut, maize and other varieties are ignored completely with the lack of guidance and technological support. Local farmers can become entrepreneurs if these are provided. Marketing will be not a major issue since Srikakulam and Vizianagaram have wonderful train and road connectivity to export their finished goods to other States,” said Mr.Sambasiva Rao.
He asked the government to establish various clusters for the promotion of agro-based industries in backward districts of the State. 
“Many people can start their units with a minimum investment of ₹ 5 lakh. The entrepreneurs can be successful in their ventures when they don’t depend absolutely on government subsidy and tax relations. However, they might help them for future expansion plans,” Mr. Sambasiva Rao added.
He assured that the federation would have an interaction session with the officials concerned at both the district and the State-level for the economic prosperity of backward Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

2016-12-06 01:10:00,Mungantiwar in altercation at demonetisation debate,"NAGPUR: State Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had a heated exchange on Monday with some members of the audience at a discussion on demonetisation when they accused him of being insensitive to the poor. He was trying to explain his government’s position on the issue when the remarks were made by audience members.
A visibly infuriated Mr. Mungantiwar argued with with the man who had interrupted his speech, asked him his name and said he could identify his political affiliation in a minute. The minister also claimed that other participants in the programme — former Maharashtra finance minister and NCP leader Jayant Patil, Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe, AAP leader Ashutosh and Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam — had brought their supporters with them, while he had come alone.
“Conflicting statements are coming from the Opposition members on demonetisation, but common people have accepted the change. Everyone except our political opponents have welcomed this step. We agree that this won’t result in a cashless society, but it can result in less cash,” Mr. Mungantiwar said, adding he had come for an academic discussion, not a political one.
Aam Admi Party (AAP) leader and former journalist Ashutosh took a dig at Mr. Mungantiwar, saying people had the right to ask questions in a democracy: “Should we stop asking questions? We, the leaders, should show some sensitivity. But alarm bells are ringing now because this Prime Minster has not addressed a single press conference in two-and-a-half years.” 
Ms. Gorhe said the audience’s political affiliations did not matter. “The important thing is that they are all Indians,” she added. ",Mumbai,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Mungantiwar-in-altercation-at-demonetisation-debate/article16765276.ece,
2016-12-07 00:41:00,BJP Chooses Maratha reservation to counter Opposition’s attack on demonetisation," To counter the Opposition’s charge of shoddy implementation of demonetisation, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena coalition has decided to use the Maratha reservation issue to corner the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the ongoing winter session of the State Legislature.
As Nagpur gets ready to witness possibly one of the biggest Maratha rallies ever held in the State on December 14, the ruling parties appear to have decided to make good use of the opportunity to corner the Maratha vote bank ahead of the forthcoming Zilla Parishad and Municipal Corporation elections.
In the Assembly, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar, Dr. Sanjay Kute, among others, along with the Shiv Sena’s Sunil Prabhu, Shambhuraj Desai and others have moved a resolution demanding reservation for the Maratha community. In the Council, the BJP’s Pravin Darekar, Sujitsinh Thakur and the Sena’s Dr. Neelam Gorhe, Shivsangram’s Vinayaka Mete, along with others, moved a similar resolution.
According to sources in the ruling coalition, the move has ensured that the Opposition does not get to take the credit of highlighting the issue in the Legislature. “If the Opposition continues to disrupt proceedings on the demonetisation issue, we can always claim that the government was ready to discuss and pass the resolution supporting Maratha reservation,” said a BJP MLA on condition of anonymity.
The resolution was to be discussed on Tuesday. However, with adjournment of both Houses, following a condolence resolution over the death of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha, it is likely to come up for debate either on Wednesday or in the coming week.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Vinod Tawde on Tuesday said the government has filed a 2,500-page affidavit in the Bombay High Court, presenting evidence to prove the Maratha community is socially, educationally and economically backward.
Government pleader Abhinandan Vagyani submitted the affidavit, that says 82 per cent of the people from the community are socially and financially backward. It therefore seeks reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the community.
The affidavit points out that the Marathas are mostly sugarcane cutters, migrant labourers, head loaders and maid servants. Mr. Vagyani said most of the farmers who committed suicide in Maharashtra over the past few years belonged to this community. The Supreme Court has said that reservation can exceed 50 per cent in exceptional circumstances, he added.
The affidavit relies on several documents and records, speeches made by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, references about the community in devotional and folk songs and religious texts by saint-poets such as Sant Tukaram, Bahinabai and Samarth Ramdas. It names Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Ambedkar in support of the claim that the Maratha community is underprivileged and backward.
A division bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice M S Sonak will hear public interest litigations opposing the Congress-NCP government’s decision to grant 16 per cent reservation to Marathas as well as some petitions in favour of it, on December 7. 
“This affidavit will strongly present the government’s side supporting reservation for Marathas. We are sure we will win this judicial battle,” Mr. Vagyani said.",Other States,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/BJP-Chooses-Maratha-reservation-to-counter-Opposition%E2%80%99s-attack-on-demonetisation/article16769489.ece,NAGPUR/MUMBAI

In a statement, they said the rollback apart, the government should announce compensation to the kin of those who died of heart seizures and other reasons while they were standing in long queues at bank branches and ATMs since November 8 to withdraw their own, hard-earned money.
They said while one did not actually know how much those with loads of black money were hit, the everyday suffering of the common man was clearly seen. Worst-hit were those 70 per cent living in rural areas and 95 per cent of population who work in the unorganised sector for whom cash is an everyday requirement.
“In a country like India with such a demographic proportion, it was simply unthinkable,” they said, pointing out while in no country had demonetisation had led to a phenomenal growth in the economy, even those nations where black money was present had not taken such a drastic move.
On one hand if the the poor were affected and livelihoods shattered without work everyday, even those who had money in their accounts could not take it out for health emergencies and other dire needs, they said. No government could remove 86 per cent of old currency notes out of the system without ensuring that new notes were printed, they added.",Hyderabad,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Poets-writers-and-intellectuals-demand-rollback-of-demonetisation/article16773760.ece,HYDERABAD
2016-12-07 22:20:00,‘Benefits of demonetisation to accrue in long term’,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the benefits of demonetisation would be felt in the long term and a short-term pain was expected.
“Demonetisation should be seen according to the effect on the economy,” Mr. Jaitley said while addressing the Petrotech 2016 conference. “No doubt we will continue to be the fastest growing major economy. A decision of this kind carries the pain of transition. This is regrettable, but it was expected.” “When you are in a cusp of history and you look at the long-term impact of these steps which are going to be taken, I think India is going to become a society in the long term with a certainly better GDP, cleaner ethics, a cleaner economy,” he added.
Cash shortage
The Finance Minister admitted that there was a shortage of cash and that was what made the parallel shift to electronic transactions so important. “In these 2-3 months, India will move digital,” he said. 
“We will achieve far more than what we have achieved in the past few decades. What we will end up achieving is to lay down a new normal.” The benefit of this new normal, he said, was the increased money in the banking system, and the greater ability of banks to support the economy.
Regarding the Goods and Services Tax and the ongoing deadlock in the GST Council over the required legislation, Mr. Jaitley said that most of the issues had been resolved and that the final draft of the legislation was being worked out.
“One issue is pending,” he added. “Since all taxes are being merged into a single tax, the issue is of how to reconcile it with the parallel machinery in the Centre and the States.” “I am hoping that all issues will be resolved soon,” he said.

2016-12-07 03:14:00,"If demonetisation fails, Modi will be destroyed","The former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda spoke to Smita Gupta on the impact of demonetisation and the evolving political situation.
In a recent speech, you compared the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi to the current situation following demonetisation...
When banks were nationalised and privy purses abolished, the people thought this major step taken by Indira Gandhi would benefit the poor and solve the unemployment problem… In the 1971 Parliament elections, she won a two-thirds majority; in 1972, after the Assembly elections, almost all the States came under the Congress umbrella; there was virtually no Opposition in the country. People believed in Indira Gandhi’s slogans, garibi hatao, berojgari hatao.
In 1971, she was at her peak. But within just three years, in Nagpur when she went to address a public meeting where she announced the slogan of a curb on consumption, people pounced on her and the police had to escort her out.
What are your objections to the demonetisation decision?
On November 17, I wrote to the Prime Minister, welcoming the move but said it had been done without a proper assessment of the situation. From November 8 to now, several alterations have been made; now the amendments to the Taxation Bill have created confusion. My concern is will these steps yield the expected results? If it does, then Modi will be a great leader. If he can achieve his dreams of a Digital India, cashless economy, within six months, certainly I will bow my head. If this demonetisation succeeds, he will be the unquestioned leader. If it fails, he will be destroyed.
What about the long term impact on the economy?
The GDP is going to go down. The value of the rupee could fluctuate. If within six months things don’t settle down, and digital India is not put in place, the problems will increase. Unemployment will grow — people in the unorgansised sector will be hit.
But there’s no social unrest yet.
No political party has provoked the situation in anyState; only Mamata Banerjee has taken a tough stand in public meetings and has spoken of a financial emergency. She’s a fighter. She has not accumulated any money; she probably has half a dozen khadi saris and is living in the same house as she was when she first entered Parliament. People speak of the Sarada scam, the chit funds in Bengal, but she’s a fighter. The people are with her.
Is it time for a Third Front?
I don’t want to jump to conclusions that there will be a Third Front tomorrow. Circumstances will create the situation ... if there is an adverse impact of demonetisation, then the people will put pressure on political parties. People are tolerant. But there will be a limit to their patience.
Who could be the leader of a possible Third Front?
Circumstances will force a name.. Who am I? In 1996, I was forced to weep on that day before the 13 parties: ‘Leave me, I am on the gaddi of Chief Minister for 18 months; I told Jyoti Basu you have been Chief Minister for 18 years; you become Prime Minister. He agreed but his party was divided….",National,The Hindu,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/If-demonetisation-fails-Modi-will-be-destroyed/article16770122.ece,
