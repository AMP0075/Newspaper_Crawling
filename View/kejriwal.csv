In his first campaign meeting for the municipal polls on Friday, Kejriwal slammed the BJP-led municipal corporations for ""corruption"" and said they had turned the capital into one massive garbage dump.    Kejriwal began his 35-minute speech in Sant Nagar, a low-income settlement in Burari, by reminding the crowd that at a recent rally at Ramlila Maidan, Shah had claimed Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party had done no work in Delhi in its two years in power. ""I challenge Amit Shah to a debate on the work done by BJP in the states it rules and by AAP in Delhi,"" said Kejriwal.    To drive home his point to the BJP national president, Kejriwal toted out some figures. ""In Delhi, anyone consuming up to 400 units of power pays a bill of Rs 1,379,"" he said. ""In Gujarat, the charge for consuming the same amount of power is Rs 2,700. In Mumbai, it is Rs 4,000, while in Karnataka, the bill come to Rs 2,700.""    Kejriwal cautioned the people that ""the power and water tariffs will increase if either BJP or the Congress comes to power in the civic bodies"". He claimed that both BJP and Congress had ""hatched a conspiracy"" to snatch the departments of power and water from the AAP government, though this would not be possible if AAP was victorious in the corporation polls.    ""Two days ago, a senior BJP leader met me and confided that a big conspiracy was being hatched. He told me that if either Congress or BJP comes to power in the civic bodies, they will increase the power and water rates in Delhi,"" he alleged.    To jeers from the partisan crowd, Kejriwal continued, ""When I asked how this could be possible, the BJP leader told me that the centre planned to take the power and water departments from the Delhi government's purview and give them to the corporations.""    The CM then criticised BJP for its decade-long stay in power in the municipal corporations. ""I challenge anyone to come forward and tell me about one good work that BJP has done in 10 years. In fact, BJP has converted the capital into one big garbage dump,"" Kejriwal said. The AAP leader promised that if his party won the civic body polls, it would clean up the city in a single year while effecting a financial turnaround for the corporations.    By holding the first public meeting in Burari, Kejriwal not only seemed to be appealing to his party's core support base, but also to a significant Purvanchali vote bank. In an emotional speech, he conjured up aspirational images for enthusiastic broom-wielding supporters of lifts and swimming pools in schools, free medicines for the poor in hospitals and free healthcare for every locality through the Mohalla Clinic project.    The CM reminded the voters that his government had paved the way for a steep increase in minimum wages for labourers and added that the current subsidies on power and water would continue. Kejriwal reiterated that property tax on residential properties would be suspended if AAP assumed power in the civic bodies.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejri-dares-shah-to-debate/articleshow/57950653.cms
2017-04-01 05:58:00,Delhi LG scraps Kejriwal govt's 'feedback unit',"NEW DELHI: More than a year after the AAP government set up a ""feedback unit"", lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has ordered its closure. Earlier in March, along with this direction, he had also ordered termination of the contractual staff appointed for the unit.    It is learnt from sources that the unit -which is being described by the opposition as a 'spying' unit -was closed in the backdrop of an ongoing CBI inquiry in the matter. Moreover, it was felt that not only was its purpose somewhat ambiguous but the appointment of the contractual staff was not according to norms and process. The government's feedback unit, comprising retired police and security experts, was created ostensibly to gather information about officials and departments under the Delhi government. It has been alleged that 20 posts were created but the file was not approved by LG.    The vigilance department had submitted a proposal for setting up the unit which was approved by the chief minister on October 28, 2015.It was to report to the vigilance secretary. The unit became functional in February 2016 and funds and other resources were allocated to it.    In January, the CBI filed a preliminary inquiry in the matter after a complaint (vigilance report) was forwarded to it by the then LG, Najeeb Jung.    A 'vigilance report' that has surfaced - TOI couldn't independently verify its authenticity - makes allegations of violation of rules and regulations and lapses in earmarking funds amounting to Rs 1 crore. It also raises questions over the propriety of conducting a sting operation at a private school - since it doesn't come under the purview of Prevention of Corruption Act - and questions the very identity of the official of Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) who conducted the sting.    The ACB chief, Mukesh Meena, alleged on Friday that no one by the identity provided existed in ACB.    Defending his government's decision, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said there was nothing wrong in setting up such a unit.""Every state should have a feedback unit and every government has it. The government should communicate with its people and take feedback. I don't think there is anything wrong in it,"" he said at a press conference on Friday.    The order gave BJP yet another opportunity to attack chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and accuse him of ""misusing his position and public money"". Vijender Gupta, leader of the opposition in the assembly, alleged: ""The unit directly reported to the CM, who didn't keep any department with him. He misused his position and public money for political gains and to settle scores with rivals.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-lg-scraps-kejriwal-govts-feedback-unit/articleshow/57953432.cms

2017-04-02 14:51:00,Can Modi chants cut taxes: CM Arvind Kejriwal,"NEW DELHI: CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday promised the voters that AAP would sort out the civic problems of Delhi within a year and abolish house tax if it wins the municipal elections.    ""Will taxes get exempted if we shout 'Modi, Modi'? If yes, I will also chant 'Modi, Modi',"" he said during his civic poll campaign in Ghonda and Gandhi Nagar assembly constituencies in east Delhi.    Attacking BJP and Congress, he warned the people that if either of the parties is voted to power, benefits like 20,000 litres of free water and subsidy in power bills initiated by his government will be rolled back.    He also linked the alleged corruption in the municipal bodies to the civic mess that Delhi has been witnessing. ""Whenever people demanded services and basic amenities, both Congress and BJP governments used to say that MCD did not have funds. We made health and education free, reduced price of electricity and are giving 20,000 litres of water free every month. Where did we get the money from? It was possible because we have checked corruption. We have saved Rs 350 crore from the construction of five flyovers in the past two years."" Kejriwal said.    He alleged that the civic bodies had failed to utilise the money given to them by the Delhi government. ""Delhi is the capital of the country, but it has been turned into a waste bin. It is the duty of the corporations to keep it clean. My government gave them Rs 4,000 crore, but they didn't do anything.""    Meanwhile, at the Ghonda rally, there was a brief interruption when the stage caved in a little when Kejriwal was being greeted by the local leaders. Nobody suffered any injury though. He claimed that the amount of work done by his government surpassed all the work done in the capital by the previous Congress and BJP governments.    ""In the past two years, we have supplied piped water to 309 colonies, which the previous governments could not do in 65 years. By December, each unauthorised colony will get piped water. Earlier, no one wanted to send their children to government schools. We have changed the state of government schools completely and children are getting quality education now. We created 8,000 classrooms which is equal to 200 new schools. BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have not been able to set up 200 schools in 15 years,"" claimed Kejriwal.    He said that if his party is voted to power, the civic staff will be paid their salaries by ""7th of each month without fail"".",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/can-modi-chants-cut-taxes-cm-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/57967854.cms
2017-04-04 04:46:00,Defer polls for shift to ballot papers: Kejriwal,"New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday reiterated his demand for use of ballot papers in the municipal polls and said if the time required to make the shift from EVM to paper was short, then the polls may be ""postponed"". Kejriwal's statement comes just three weeks before the polls and his demand came with repeated assertions questioning the reliability of EVMs.    Reacting to the Election Commission's remark, asking AAP to ""introspect"" on the reasons behind its performance in Punjab, Kejriwal hit back, taking a dig at ECI saying he was ""considering including the EC in his party's decision-making body, the political affairs committee (PAC)"". ""I have written a letter to ECI and offered that we have the experts who can prove that the voting machines can be tampered with. I challenge the ECI to give us the machines and 72 hours to prove it,"" Kejriwal said.    He had made the demand for use of ballot paper after the Punjab assembly poll results were announced. Kejriwal's demand was rejected by LG Anil Baijal who cited ""time constraints"" to effect any change in the mode of polling.    Unfazed by the announcement, Kerjiwal kept reiterating his demand. At a press conference on Monday, he alleged that there was ""widespread tampering"" of EVMs and claimed VVPAT machines from Uttar Pradesh were being brought to conduct the Rajouri Garden bypoll. ""MCD polls should be held using paper ballots. It should be postponed if time is required to do that,"" he said in response to a question from journalists.    He also questioned the ECI for sending EVMs used in Uttar Pradesh's Govind Nagar to Madhya Pradesh's Bhind for conducting bypolls there. At Bhind, VVPAT-enabled EVMs were found printing the BJP's poll symbol irrespective of the button pressed during a mock trial, which the opposition parties had latched on to.    Kejriwal questioned as to how the machines from UP had been taken to MP. ""This goes against the norm that EVMs used in one election cannot be used in another for at least 45 days,"" the CM said.    The AAP chief said in the light of reports that even VVPAT machines were not reliable, ballot papers were the ""only safe option"", which, he said, has been adopted by many western countries.    ""The microchips inside the EVMs can be fiddled with. Sophisticated software is being used to do that. But not all machines are tampered with, the critical ones are,"" Kejriwal alleged.    Kejriwal had met the chief election commissioner (CEC) on Saturday to demand an investigation into the reason behind the faulty EVMs, which allegedly recorded only BJP votes, irrespective of which button was being pressed.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/defer-polls-for-shift-to-ballot-papers-kejriwal/articleshow/57998249.cms
2017-04-04 09:08:00,"Ram Jethmalani bills Arvind Kejriwal Rs 3.42 crore, Delhi government wants taxpayers to pay","NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is fighting a  high-powered legal battle+  with Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, who has sued him for civil and criminal defamation, Times Now has discovered that the Delhi government wants the taxpayer to pay the cost of Kejriwal's defence, running into crores. Kejriwal's counsel, Ram Jethmalani, has raised a bill of Rs 3.42 crore for his services so far.    According to documents accessed by Times Now, the bill raised by Jethmalani on December 1, 2016, quotes Rs 1 crore retainership for representing Kejriwal and an additional Rs 22 lakh per appearance. Jethmalani has made 11 appearances so far, leading to a total of Rs 3.42 crore, even before the cross examination stage is over.  Kejriwal is 1st Delhi CM on trial for criminal defamationArvind Kejriwal will stand trial in a criminal defamation case filed by Union minister Arun Jaitley. Kejriwal becomes the first CM in Delhi’s history to face criminal defamation charges. A Delhi court on Saturday put the CM on trial in a hearing marked by chaos and alleged “death threats.”  The documents show that deputy CM Manish Sisodia wrote on a file on December 6, 2016, following the bill raised by Jethmalani's office, that it be cleared because the matter was linked to CBI raids on the CM's office on December 15, 2015, wherein several files were seized.    The file goes on to say that ""the Chief Minister made statements in the media explaining the stand of the government on such raids. Defamation cases, criminal as well as civil, were filed against the CM pursuant to the statements made in his official capacity"".    The file then went to the litigation branch of the law department in the Delhi government which, on December 7, 2016, said the law department could not give any approval on the matter, and instead approval of the administrative department whose files had been seized by the CBI were needed to clear these payments. Clearances from the finance department and Delhi lieutenant governor's office were also needed, it added.    In response, Sisodia on December 21 wrote that ""this file need not be sent to the LG for his approval. Instead it should be sent to the concerned administrative department, the GAD (general administrative department)"" which should give its compliance at the earliest, ""preferably within a day"".    The file, approved by the CM, was then cleared the same day. This was then approved by the minister in-charge of GAD, Gopal Rai, on February 27, this year, before being sent to the LG, presumably for a post-facto approval.    A legal analyst pointed out that Jaitley and Kejriwal were both fighting the case in their personal capacities. If Kejriwal had wanted to turn it into a matter involving the Delhi CM, he should have invoked Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code, the analyst added.    Section 80 provides for sending a notice to the government or a public officer if one wants to institute a suit against the government or against the public officer in respect of any act purporting to be done by such public officer in his official capacity until the expiration of two months.    The object of the notice is to give the secretary of state or the public officer an opportunity to reconsider his legal position and to make amends or afford restitution without recourse to a court of law, which Kejriwal chose not to do.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jethmalani-bills-cm-rs-342-crore-delhi-govt-wants-to-pick-up-tab/articleshow/57999031.cms
2017-04-05 01:20:00,"Case a ‘private’ matter, Arvind Kejriwal told HC","NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had described Union finance minister Arun Jaitley's defamation suit against him as ""private in character"", according to court records.    AAP and Kejriwal have argued that the CM is not fighting a personal legal battle and the defamation case is a fallout of a probe ordered by the Delhi government to clean up corruption in the cricket administration in the city. That's why, they have argued, the Delhi government should pay the legal fees. But before the Delhi high court last year, the CM had sought to end the criminal defamation complaint filed by Jaitley against him on the ground that it was private in nature.    Justice P S Teji, who eventually dismissed Kejriwal's petition seeking to quash summons issued by a trial court on Jaitley's criminal defamation complaint, recorded in his October 19 order last year the main grounds cited by the CM. ""The present petition has been preferred by the petitioner (Kejriwal) mainly on the ground that the criminal proceedings are ought to be stayed as the civil suit has been filed on the basis of same facts and allegations. Further ground taken is that there are similarities in both the proceedings initiated by the respondent no.1 (Jaitley), such as the facts that the parties are same, events are same, date of filing is same, cause of action is same and both proceedings are private in character,"" HC recorded as Kejriwal's submission.    The court dismissed Kejriwal's plea for staying criminal prosecution and observed: ""Though it is correct that the parties in both these cases are same but the fact is that both cases are different in nature. While the civil proceedings have been initiated claiming damages for damaging the reputation of Respondent No.1, the case at hand is criminal defamation. Pendency of both cases cannot be said to be amounting to double jeopardy.""    It had clarified that there is no legal impediment to ""invoke the civil proceedings for defamation as well as initiating the criminal proceedings for defamation simultaneously and continuation of the same.""    A Delhi government spokesperson, however, dismissed the stand taken by Kejriwal in Delhi HC as a ""non-issue"" and pointed out that till date not a paisa has been paid to senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani.    He referred to Jaitley's reply during his cross-examination last month where Jethmalani asked him why the finance minister sued Kejriwal for commenting on the allegations which were originally made by academic Madhu Kishwar who was not sued. Jaitley had responded: ""Many people on social media make irresponsible statements about people in public life, but when a CM endorses them, it becomes a serious matter. Even false allegations gain credibility. Repetition of a libellous statement gives me a cause of action against the person, particularly if he has stature, to take action against that person.""    The spokesperson said that from this statement of Jaitley, it is very clear that ""he filed a defamation case against CM Arvind Kejriwal and not against a person named Arvind Kejriwal.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/case-a-private-matter-kejri-told-hc/articleshow/58017542.cms
2017-04-05 01:19:00,Why should I pay from my pocket: Arvind Kejriwal,"NEW DELHI: ""Why will I pay the bill of Ram Jethmalani from my pocket,"" said CM Arvind Kejriwal as he addressed a rally in northeast Delhi's Sundar Nagri on Tuesday evening. The AAP national convener asked the public as to who should pay the fee—the Delhi government or Kerjriwal.    Incidentally, Sundar Nagri was the ground zero of Kejriwal's RTI movement. Launched more than 15 years ago, it was aimed at unearthing corruption in the PDS scheme and other public services.    On Tuesday, Kejriwal returned to the area, seeking the support of locals for AAP ahead of the civic polls. ""Friends, I am feeling very good coming to Sundar Nagri, which is my home. Many years ago, we came out to unearth corruption in the system from this place,"" he said.    ""There was corruption in Delhi & District Cricket Association. Young cricket aspirants used to come to me to complain about corruption in the selection process,"" Kejriwal said to justify the committee set up by his government to look into the functioning of the DDCA and submit a report.    ""But BJP filed a case against me...Why should I pay Jethmalani's fee from my pocket. The public should tell me who should pay the fee—the government or Kejriwal,"" Kejriwal said in a bid to justify his government's stand on payment in the defamation case filed against him by Union finance minister Arun Jaitley. Jethmalani, a senior lawyer, is defending Kejriwal in the case.    AAP is caught in a political storm over reports of how the Delhi government wants the state exchequer to foot the lawyer's hefty bill—Rs 3.42 crore.    Earlier in the day, deputy CM Manish Sisodia mounted the defence of the AAP-led Delhi government saying, ""This whole matter is related to the corruption in DDCA...Many renowned names in the field of cricket complained about the working of DDCA to the CM. Based on these complaints, the CM set up a probe into the functioning of DDCA. The probe committee in its report found a lot of corruption in DDCA.""    Sisodia said it was the Delhi government, which is fighting against corruption. ""Kejriwal is standing behind the youth dreaming of becoming cricketers and will continue to support them,"" the deputy CM said.    Sisodia also alleged that the Kejriwal was being attacked for highlighting the issue of tampered EVMs. ""This fee issue is being highlighted now when the EVM scam has been unearthed in Madhya Pradesh,"" he said.    Meanwhile, Kejriwal expressed apprehension that health minister Satyendar Jain might be arrested within a week. ""After we came to power, Jain introduced a slew of health schemes, which annoyed some big medicine companies and corrupt agents. They (companies) went to BJP seeking help. After this, CBI lodged four cases against Jain,"" Kejriwal said, adding, ""Jain might be arrested within a week.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-should-i-pay-from-my-pocket-kejri/articleshow/58017530.cms
2017-04-05 01:22:00,Jethmalani fee row: BJP accuses Kejriwal of plundering government money,"NEW DELHI: Looking to mount pressure on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, BJP said on Tuesday his government's preparedness to pay a fat fee to lawyer Ram Jethmalani in a private defamation case amounts to plundering of public money and said the saffron party will oppose it tooth and nail.    Flanked by Delhi leader Vijender Gupta, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar held a press conference in which he said it was a personal case involving Kejriwal and the government had no role in it. Hence, the government treasury should not be used to pay fees running into crores to Jethmalani.    ""The process to pay from the government is nothing less than a scam, which will be opposed tooth and nail. The party will explore all options to thwart this bid to pay,"" said Javadekar.    He said there is no government involvement at any stage in the case raising questions over the state treasury. ""Case is personally against Kejriwal and he should pay from his own pocket,"" Javadekar said.    Drawing a contrast, the minister said the complainant in the case, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, had paid Rs 10-lakh from own pocket as stamp fee while filing the defamation case against Kejriwal. ""Jaitley ji has been making all the payments from own pocket where is the point of involving government?"" Javadekar questioned.    The minister said Kejriwal has some seven similar cases pending against him. ""Does that mean that he will pay around Rs 100 crore from people's fund to fight his private battles after making reckless allegations?"" Javadekar asked.    The saffron party has decided to make the fee demand a major poll issue in the MCD polls to highlight what it says is the double standard between Kejriwal's words and deeds. ""We have already lodged a complaint with the LG and BJP will be on the streets against the move,"" said Vijender Gupta.    Kejriwal is fighting a high-powered legal battle with Jaitley, who has sued him for civil and criminal defamation. Kejriwal's counsel, Ram Jethmalani, has raised a bill of Rs 3.42 crore for his services so far though the lawyer has now said he could waive off the fees if his client cannot pay.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jethmalani-fee-row-bjp-accuses-kejriwal-of-plundering-govt-money/articleshow/58017581.cms

Sources said that the Lt Governor is learnt to have written to Kumar seeking his advice on whether the payment should be cleared or not.
